### [1] [A Path to Loving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05352)
*John Beverley,Regina Hurley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文为爱提供了一个严谨的本体论框架，结合哲学与科学视角，强调心理学和社会学，并探讨其对AI应用的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爱的哲学复杂性和科学相关性需要系统化研究，以平衡其情感与理性层面，并为跨学科应用提供基础。

Method: 采用基本形式本体论（BFO）等方法，区分爱的不同含义，并提出因果关联模型连接情感与认知。

Result: 提出爱的本体论框架，证明情感与判断的关联性，为AI和科学领域的应用奠定基础。

Conclusion: 爱是情感与判断的结合，其本体论研究为跨学科应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

### [2] [Towards Data Systems That Are Business Semantic-Centric and AI Agents-Assisted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05520)
*Cecil Pang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BSDS是一个以业务语义为中心、AI代理辅助的数据系统，通过整合架构、工作流和团队组织，将数据系统从被动工具转变为业务增长的主动驱动力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据平台过于注重工具而忽视业务需求，导致效率低下和延迟，BSDS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BSDS采用模块化架构，包括业务实体关联的精选数据、上下文感知AI代理的知识库和高效数据管道，同时优化工作流和团队组织。

Result: 实际验证表明，BSDS加速了数据驱动项目的上市时间，增强了跨职能协作，并为各种规模企业提供了可扩展的蓝图。

Conclusion: BSDS为未来研究提供了基础，可探索复杂系统和自适应网络理论的优化策略，以及基于AI代理的自主数据系统。

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

### [3] [Contextual Memory Intelligence -- A Foundational Paradigm for Human-AI Collaboration and Reflective Generative AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05370)
*Kristy Wedel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为上下文记忆智能（CMI）的新范式，旨在解决生成式AI系统中的记忆限制问题，通过结构化捕获、推理和再生上下文，提升系统的连贯性、可解释性和决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI系统在记忆组件（如RAG、向量存储和LLM代理）方面虽有进展，但仍存在显著的记忆限制，导致重复错误和决策不透明。CMI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CMI通过引入Insight Layer模块化架构，结合人在环反思、漂移检测和理由保存，将上下文记忆整合到系统中。

Result: CMI使系统能够基于数据、历史、判断和变化上下文进行推理，填补了当前AI架构和治理中的盲点。

Conclusion: CMI为构建高效、可反思、可审计且社会负责的智能系统提供了框架，增强了人机协作、生成式AI设计和机构韧性。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

### [4] [Constructive Symbolic Reinforcement Learning via Intuitionistic Logic and Goal-Chaining Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05422)
*Andrei T. Patrascu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于逻辑推理的学习与规划框架，取代传统的基于奖励的优化方法，通过构建直觉逻辑的证明实现决策，确保状态转换和策略的逻辑有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖概率试错，可能导致不安全或无效的转换，而本文旨在通过逻辑推理实现安全、可解释且高效的规划。

Method: 将动作、状态转换和目标表示为逻辑命题，通过直觉逻辑构建构造性证明，确保每一步转换都有可验证的前提条件。

Result: 在结构化网格世界中，该方法实现了零无效动作、完美安全性和高效收敛，优于传统Q学习。

Conclusion: 本文为强化学习提供了基于构造逻辑和证明理论的新方向，适用于安全规划和可信AI。

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

### [5] [Avoiding Death through Fear Intrinsic Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05529)
*Rodney Sanchez,Ferat Sahin,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于早期杏仁核发展的内在奖励函数，通过记忆增强神经网络架构实现，用于避免探索终止状态，模拟动物恐惧条件反射行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在评估时需要设计外在奖励函数，但环境中某些状态（如死亡）无法提供直接反馈，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 引入一种内在奖励函数，通过记忆增强神经网络（MANN）架构生成，模拟恐惧条件反射，避免探索终止状态。

Result: 在Miniworld Sidewalk环境中，该方法成功模拟了恐惧条件反射行为，并展示了类似广泛性焦虑障碍（GADs）的行为范围。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种生物启发的神经网络架构和恐惧条件反射框架，能有效解决非描述性终止条件的环境问题。

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

### [6] [When Models Know More Than They Can Explain: Quantifying Knowledge Transfer in Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05579)
*Quan Shi,Carlos E. Jimenez,Shunyu Yao,Nick Haber,Diyi Yang,Karthik Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI推理能力的提升是否改善了知识转移（即模型能否以人类可理解的方式传达推理），并提出了KITE框架进行大规模实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI推理能力的提升是否促进了知识转移，即模型能否有效帮助人类理解、应用和学习其推理过程。

Method: 引入KITE框架，进行两阶段实验：人类与AI共同构思问题解决策略，然后人类独立实施解决方案，以评估模型解释对人类理解的影响。

Result: 模型基准性能与协作结果相关，但关系不一致，存在显著异常值，表明知识转移需要专门优化。

Conclusion: 知识转移的成功受行为和策略因素影响，需进一步优化模型以提升其沟通能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

### [7] [MMTU: A Massive Multi-Task Table Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05587)
*Junjie Xing,Yeye He,Mengyu Zhou,Haoyu Dong,Shi Han,Lingjiao Chen,Dongmei Zhang,Surajit Chaudhuri,H. V. Jagadish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMTU是一个大规模基准测试，包含25种现实世界表格任务的30K问题，旨在全面评估模型在专家级别上理解、推理和操作表格的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对表格相关任务的评估有限，主要集中在NL-to-SQL和Table-QA等任务，忽略了专业用户面临的更广泛任务。MMTU填补了这一空白。

Method: MMTU基于数十年的计算机科学研究，设计了25种复杂表格任务，涵盖表格理解、推理和编码等技能。

Result: 前沿模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU上的表现仅为60%左右，表明仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU为结构化数据处理和分析的基础模型发展提供了重要基准，有望推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMTU-benchmark/MMTU.

### [8] [Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05616)
*Lianhao Zhou,Hongyi Ling,Keqiang Yan,Kaiji Zhao,Xiaoning Qian,Raymundo Arróyave,Xiaofeng Qian,Shuiwang Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPPS框架通过结合规划、物理和科学家反馈，实现了更高自主性的材料发现，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究限制代理在预定义工作流中执行任务，而MAPPS旨在自动化工作流规划，满足高层次目标和科学家直觉。

Method: MAPPS由工作流规划器、工具代码生成器和科学协调器组成，利用LLM生成多步工作流，合成可执行代码，并协调反馈与错误恢复。

Result: 在MP-20数据上，MAPPS在稳定性、独特性和新颖性方面比现有生成模型提升了五倍。

Conclusion: MAPPS是一个有前景的自主材料发现框架，通过实验验证了其灵活性和可靠性。

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

### [9] [Population-Proportional Preference Learning from Human Feedback: An Axiomatic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05619)
*Kihyun Kim,Jiawei Zhang,Asuman Ozdaglar,Pablo A. Parrilo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的偏好学习框架，旨在通过成对比较数据推断评估者偏好的真实分布，并构建满足社会选择理论公理的政策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法可能偏向某些意见或群体，本文旨在开发一种能更公平反映评估者偏好分布的方法。

Method: 通过成对比较数据推断评估者群体分布，构建满足单调性、帕累托效率等公理的政策，并引入软最大松弛方法平衡比例代表与Condorcet胜者选择。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在表格推荐任务和大规模语言模型对齐中的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 新框架能更公平地反映评估者偏好分布，满足多种公理要求，适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

*Gouki Minegishi,Hiroki Furuta,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过引入推理图的概念，分析了大型推理模型的内部机制，发现蒸馏模型在循环性、直径和小世界特性上优于基础模型，且这些特性与任务难度和模型容量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型成功的内部机制，并探索其推理图结构的特性。

Method: 通过聚类隐藏状态表示提取推理图，并分析其循环性、直径和小世界指数等图论特性。

Result: 蒸馏模型表现出更多的循环、更大的直径和更明显的小世界特性，这些特性与任务难度和模型容量正相关。

Conclusion: 推理图结构分析为提升模型推理能力提供了理论指导和实践建议。

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

*Emil Biju,Shayan Talaei,Zhemin Huang,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Azalia Mirhoseini,Amin Saberi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRINT框架通过动态并行化优化大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理效率，减少序列化token数量，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂任务时通常生成冗长的序列化推理链，导致推理时间过长，SPRINT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPRINT通过数据重组和微调，使LRMs能够动态识别并行化机会，并执行独立子任务。

Result: 实验表明，SPRINT在数学等领域性能相当，但减少了39%的序列化token，且在GPQA和Countdown任务中分别减少45%和65%的token。

Conclusion: SPRINT有效提升了推理效率，适用于复杂任务，且具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

*Emmanuel Anaya Gonzalez,Sairam Vaidya,Kanghee Park,Ruyi Ji,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MCMC的约束采样框架，满足约束条件、单调收敛和高效性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束解码方法会扭曲模型分布，影响多样性，尤其在程序模糊测试等应用中。

Method: 构建有效输出的提议分布，结合Metropolis-Hastings接受准则，确保约束空间的高效探索。

Result: 在合成基准和实际程序模糊测试任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架在满足约束的同时保持了模型分布的高效性和多样性。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Motivation: 现有层次k博弈框架忽略了代理间驾驶复杂性和状态的动态变化，导致冗余和错误计算。

Method: 提出轨迹熵度量，从多模态轨迹预测结果中提取不确定性统计信号，并通过信噪比量化代理的游戏状态，改进框架。

Result: 在Waymo和nuPlan数据集上验证，预测精度提升19.89%，规划精度提升16.48%。

Conclusion: 轨迹熵方法显著优化了层次k博弈框架，实现了更高的精度和更低的计算成本。

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user
engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic,
trust-building process.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming
visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and
labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address
these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key
contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that
synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset,
a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants
capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page:

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于规则的ABM和深度学习）在预测准确性或可解释性上存在不足，且缺乏适应动态环境的能力。CrimeMind旨在通过LLM和RAT的结合解决这些问题。

Method: CrimeMind整合了RAT到LLM驱动的ABM框架中，利用多模态城市特征推理犯罪行为。通过人类标注数据集和文本梯度方法对齐模型感知与人类判断。

Result: 在四个美国城市的实验中，CrimeMind在犯罪热点预测和空间分布精度上优于传统ABM和深度学习方法，提升达24%。还能模拟外部事件和政策干预的影响。

Conclusion: CrimeMind实现了细粒度行为建模，并能有效评估现实干预措施，为城市犯罪模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CP-Bench基准数据集，用于评估LLM在约束编程建模中的能力，并比较了不同建模系统的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束建模是约束编程的核心瓶颈，现有评估数据集缺乏多样性，无法反映真实场景。

Method: 引入CP-Bench数据集，评估LLM在三种约束建模系统中的表现，并采用提示和推理方法优化模型生成。

Result: Python框架表现更优，结合文档丰富的提示和自验证方法，准确率可达70%。

Conclusion: CP-Bench填补了评估空白，LLM在约束建模中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 大规模行程规划问题需要在最大化兴趣点得分的同时最小化时间和成本，但严格可分解性难以满足，因此引入弱可分解性定义。

Method: 提出基于弱可分解性的多目标协同进化算法，包括动态分解策略、优化潜力定义和计算资源分配策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，算法优于现有方法，且随着问题规模增大优势更明显。

Conclusion: 弱可分解性定义和提出的算法有效解决了大规模行程规划问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

Abstract: The Maximum Satisfiability problem (MaxSAT) is a major optimization challenge
with numerous practical applications. In recent MaxSAT evaluations, most MaxSAT
solvers have adopted an ILP solver as part of their portfolios. This paper
investigates the impact of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) preprocessing
techniques on MaxSAT solving. Experimental results show that ILP preprocessing
techniques help WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024
in the unweighted track, solve 15 additional instances. Moreover, current
state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily use an ILP solver in their portfolios,
while our proposed approach reduces the need to call an ILP solver in a
portfolio including WMaxCDCL or MaxCDCL.

TL;DR: PersonaAgent是一个个性化的LLM代理框架，通过个性化记忆和动作模块，结合实时用户偏好对齐策略，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理缺乏灵活性，无法满足用户多样化需求，因此开发了PersonaAgent以实现个性化任务。

Method: PersonaAgent整合个性化记忆模块（情景和语义记忆）和动作模块，通过用户独特的系统提示（persona）作为中介，优化实时用户偏好对齐。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaAgent在个性化动作空间和实时应用中表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaAgent展示了在动态个性化用户体验中的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

TL;DR: RefPlan是一种基于双重贝叶斯离线模型规划的新方法，通过将规划重新定义为贝叶斯后验估计，统一了不确定性建模与模型规划，显著提升了保守离线强化学习策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在在线探索成本高或不安全时至关重要，但常因数据有限而面临高认知不确定性。现有方法依赖固定保守策略，限制了适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出Reflect-then-Plan（RefPlan），通过实时观测更新环境动态的信念，并将不确定性通过边缘化融入模型规划。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，RefPlan显著提升了保守离线强化学习策略的性能，在高认知不确定性和有限数据下表现稳健，且对环境动态变化具有韧性。

Conclusion: RefPlan提高了离线学习策略的灵活性、泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EvidenceOutcomes，一个从生物医学文献中提取临床有意义结果的新型标注语料库，解决了现有基准中结果元素被忽视或简化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在循证医学中，结果（Outcomes）是最复杂的PICO元素之一，但现有基准常忽视或简化其标注，因此需要高质量的标注语料库。

Method: 通过迭代和讨论制定标注指南，由三名独立标注者对500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP摘要的结果与结论部分进行标注，构建EvidenceOutcomes。同时，使用PubMedBERT模型进行微调。

Result: 标注语料库的标注者间一致性为0.76。PubMedBERT模型在EBM-NLP子集上实体级F1得分为0.69，标记级为0.76。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为未来机器学习算法开发和测试的共享基准，用于提取生物医学摘要中的临床有意义结果。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合检索增强生成和自校正机制的LLMs方法，用于语义角色标注（SRL），在多个基准测试中超越了现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成式解码器的大型语言模型（LLMs）在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但在SRL任务中仍落后于BERT类编码器-解码器模型。本文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 通过两种机制增强LLMs：（a）检索增强生成，利用外部语言学知识；（b）自校正，识别并修正不一致的SRL输出。

Result: 在CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009和CoNLL-2012三个基准测试中，该方法在中文和英文SRL任务中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 这是首次成功应用LLMs在SRL任务中超越编码器-解码器方法，为LLMs在复杂NLP任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上，R2AG在临床效果和自然语言生成指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: R2AG通过填补语义空白和提供推理路径，帮助LLM避免临床误解，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Method: 提出ASTS算法，结合动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励惩罚调整，优化局部典型采样（LTS）。

Result: 实验表明，ASTS在多个基准测试中表现优于现有采样技术，减少了重复、增强了语义对齐并提高了流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS是一种高效且有效的解码策略，适用于需要高质量文本生成的任务。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

Result: 在五个真实世界网络中，TGTalker在链接预测任务中表现优异，优于TGN和HTGN等流行模型，并能生成预测的文本解释。

Conclusion: TGTalker为时序链接预测的可解释性开辟了新方向，代码已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

### [30] [Auto Review: Second Stage Error Detection for Highly Accurate Information Extraction from Phone Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05400)
*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Auto Review系统，通过两阶段后处理流程提高医疗电话转录的准确性，减少人工审核负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗电话转录中的噪声和领域术语导致信息提取不准确，影响患者治疗效率。

Method: 采用多ASR替代方案和伪标签技术，结合大型语言模型和特征模型提升转录质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了转录准确性，提升了Auto Review的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理流程有效解决了ASR问题，减少了人工干预，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [31] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AsymKV的训练无关压缩框架，通过利用KV缓存中的不对称性（键的同质性和值的异质性），显著提升了长上下文建模的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）中注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，而现有的KV缓存压缩方法未能区分键和值的特性。

Method: 提出AsymKV框架，结合基于同质性的键合并和数学证明的无损值压缩技术。

Result: 在LLaMA3.1-8B等模型上，AsymKV在LongBench任务中平均得分43.95，显著优于现有方法（如H$_2$O的38.89）。

Conclusion: KV缓存中的不对称性是压缩的关键因素，AsymKV通过针对性设计显著提升了长上下文建模的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在4位量化时面临激活异常值的挑战，影响量化精度。SmoothRot旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SmoothRot整合了通道缩放和Hadamard变换，将极端异常值转化为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 在LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B和Mistral 7B等模型上，SmoothRot将量化与FP16模型的性能差距缩小了10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态现实场景中难以持续整合新知识和技能，现有持续学习方法和基准存在局限性。

Method: 提出参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制，防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验显示该方法能最小化遗忘，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL为动态场景下的持续学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用无监督机器学习技术分析儿童语言发展轨迹，发现特定语言障碍（SLI）主要表现为语言产出减少而非句法复杂性缺陷，挑战了传统分类诊断框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法可能忽略细微发展模式，研究旨在通过无监督学习揭示SLI儿童的自然语言发展轨迹，为早期识别和干预提供依据。

Method: 分析了1,163名4-16岁儿童的叙事样本，使用主成分分析（PCA）和聚类技术评估64种语言特征。

Result: 发现两个主要集群：语言产出高且SLI患病率低，以及产出有限但句法复杂性高且SLI患病率高。边界案例支持语言能力的连续模型。

Conclusion: SLI主要表现为语言产出减少，研究结果支持无监督学习技术在优化诊断标准和干预策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增强关联规则的新方法，通过规则到文本的转换，将规则集作为RAG输入到LLM中，显著提升了基于数据集的问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过可解释的机器学习方法（如增强关联规则）改进基于数据集/数据库的问答，同时确保方法的安全性（如RAG）。

Method: 提出了一种方法：基于定义的知识模式生成规则集，通过规则到文本转换器将规则转换为文本形式，并将结果作为RAG输入到LLM中。

Result: 与ChatGPT（包括使用代理）相比，该方法在基于数据集的问答中表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力，未来可通过引入其他模式或规则挖掘作为代理等方式进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床问题回答中从电子健康记录中提取相关信息并生成高质量回答的挑战。

Method: 使用大型语言模型分两步：1）筛选相关句子；2）生成简短且有引用的回答。优化方法包括少量样本提示、自一致性和阈值。

Result: 发现较小的8B模型在筛选相关信息时优于较大的70B模型，且准确的句子选择对生成高质量回答至关重要。

Conclusion: 自一致性与阈值优化能提高句子选择的可靠性，从而提升回答质量。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外身份信息，而SynthesizeMe旨在通过用户交互直接生成个性化角色。

Method: 生成并验证用户偏好的解释，从中诱导合成角色，筛选信息丰富的交互数据以构建个性化提示。

Result: 在Chatbot Arena上提升4.4%的准确性，并在PersonalRewardBench上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe为个性化LLM奖励建模提供了一种无需额外身份信息的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量公开数据集来评估LLM模拟真实用户行为的能力，尤其是结合可观察行为和内部推理的数据。

Method: 通过在线问卷和定制浏览器插件收集用户行为数据，包括用户画像、浏览器观察、细粒度网络行为及实时自我报告的理由。

Result: 建立了首个基准，评估LLM在给定用户画像和行为历史下预测用户下一步行为和理由的能力。

Conclusion: OPERA数据集为未来研究LLM作为个性化数字孪生体奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Motivation: 现有研究未充分探讨AD转录本中说话者性别对检测结果的影响，可能导致模型过拟合性别特征而非疾病特征。

Method: 提出了Extended Confounding Filter和Dual Filter两种方法，用于隔离和消除与性别相关的权重。

Result: 实验表明，消除性别相关权重可减少性别干扰，但略微降低了AD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过消除性别干扰，可以构建更鲁棒的AD分类器，但需权衡检测性能的轻微下降。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas是一个新的大规模基准测试，用于评估LLMs在文化背景下表达个性的能力，覆盖六个国家的3000个场景问题，显著提高了模型与人类个性分布的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在互动应用中的普及，个性表达与文化背景的结合变得至关重要，但现有研究忽视了文化与个性的相互作用。

Method: 引入CulturalPersonas基准测试，包含六个国家的3000个场景问题，通过多选题和开放式问题评估三种LLMs。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著减少了模型与人类个性分布的差异（Wasserstein距离降低20%以上），并生成更具文化一致性的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas为LLMs的全球行为规范对齐提供了新方向，有望推动更具社会智能和全球适应性的模型发展。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally

*Zefan Zeng,Xingchen Hu,Qing Cheng,Weiping Ding,Wentao Li,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEFA是一个基于多源证据模糊聚合的零样本框架，用于事件因果关系识别（ECI），通过任务分解和模糊聚合显著减少因果幻觉错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECI模型依赖大规模标注数据，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本ECI中易产生因果幻觉。MEFA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将因果关系推理分解为三个主任务和三个辅助任务，利用精心设计的提示引导LLMs生成响应，并通过模糊聚合整合证据进行评分和判定。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MEFA的F1分数和精确度分别比次优无监督基线高6.2%和9.3%，显著减少幻觉错误。

Conclusion: 任务分解和模糊聚合的有效性得到验证，MEFA在零样本ECI中表现出色。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Motivation: 研究动机在于从理论和计算复杂性角度统一表示PSG、DG和CG的语法结构，以解决自然语言中的不连续性问题。

Method: 提出对应原则，通过土耳其语的不连续从属从句案例，展示如何统一表示三种语法形式。

Result: 实现了对不连续句子的统一表示，并简化了计算复杂性，对句法分析有重要意义。

Conclusion: 该研究为自然语言的不连续性提供了新的理论视角，并为PSG、DG和CG的统一表示提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Result: 通过基准测试，揭示了GraphRAG优于传统RAG的场景及其成功原因。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench为GraphRAG的实际应用提供了指导，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于渐进式过载原则的课程学习框架（POCL），用于改进大型语言模型的知识蒸馏（KD），通过逐步增加训练样本难度来提升学生模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在训练过程中可能导致学生模型分布显著偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，因此需要一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: POCL包含两个核心组件：难度测量器（对样本从易到难排序）和训练调度器（逐步引入样本并调整损失函数温度）。

Result: 实验表明，POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种白盒KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: POCL通过结构化训练数据，增强了蒸馏过程的稳定性和模型性能，为LLM的KD提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在多领域表现优异，但在关系深度学习（RDL）中的应用尚未充分探索，现有方法存在忽略关系结构、冗余和上下文长度限制等问题。

Method: Rel-LLM采用图神经网络（GNN）编码器生成结构化关系提示，通过检索增强生成（RAG）框架保留数据库的关系结构，并利用去规范化过程将特征表示转化为提示。

Result: 实验表明，Rel-LLM在关键RDL任务上优于现有方法，提供了一种可扩展且高效的LLM与结构化数据集成方案。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM为LLM处理关系数据提供了新思路，解决了传统方法的局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

Method: 提出了一种知识遗忘评估框架，利用知识图谱表示事实上下文，并通过LLM推理评估遗忘效果。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能更真实、严格地评估遗忘效果，并揭示现有评估策略高估了遗忘有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为知识遗忘提供了更准确的评估方法，并指出了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了长文本写作性能，并在长输入推理任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为长上下文训练提供了新的视角，展示了强化学习在长文本生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

Result: 现有LLMs在未提供背景数据时表现不佳，显示需要更强的RAG框架。

Conclusion: 多模态检索与推理能力对LLMs在复杂领域（如医疗）的应用至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary

TL;DR: LLMs can perceive time passage and adapt behavior, validated through experiments on token-time mapping, response length adjustment, and time pressure navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether LLMs can perceive and adapt to the passage of time, a capability previously unexamined.

Method: Three experiments: Token-Time Hypothesis validation, response length adaptation under urgency, and BombRush navigation challenge under time pressure.

Result: LLMs show awareness of time passage, linking tokens to physical time, with performance varying by model size and reasoning ability.

Conclusion: LLMs possess temporal awareness, providing a foundation for improving time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

Conclusion: MAPLE通过多智能体协作和长期记忆有效提升表格问答能力。

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing

sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE

mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning为未来评估和改进LRMs在特定领域复杂推理任务中的表现奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型在推理时存在“跨语言崩溃”现象，即模型倾向于回归到预训练主导语言，而非提示语言。通过GRPO方法实验，揭示了语言不平衡、一致性奖励的代价及崩溃的不可逆性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言大模型在推理任务中的语言一致性机制，揭示预训练语言不平衡对推理能力的影响。

Method: 使用GRPO方法在中文、韩语和乌克兰语的翻译数据集上微调多语言大模型，监控任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: 发现GRPO会迅速放大语言不平衡，语言一致性奖励能缓解崩溃但牺牲准确性，且崩溃现象难以逆转。

Conclusion: 多语言模型的推理能力在不同语言间并不平等，预训练语言不平衡、奖励设计和数据难度是关键因素。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner为高效、自适应的LLM推理提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

*Xiaofei Xu,Xiuzhen Zhang,Ke Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MisMitiFact是一个高效框架，用于生成基于事实的反驳虚假信息的响应，通过轻量级反馈模型减少LLM的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息对社会构成威胁，手动事实核查成本高且难以扩展，LLM虽能自动化生成反驳，但存在幻觉问题。

Method: 提出MisMitiFact框架，利用轻量级反馈模型对LLM输出进行细粒度修正，确保响应基于事实。

Result: 实验表明，MisMitiFact生成的反驳质量与LLM自反馈相当，但反馈生成效率提高约5倍。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact是一种高效、低成本的大规模虚假信息缓解方案。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Motivation: 现有同质MoE-LoRA架构存在表示崩溃和专家负载不平衡问题，限制了LLM的潜力。

Method: 提出异构MoA方法，支持Soft MoA（加权融合专家输出）和Sparse MoA（稀疏激活专家）两种变体。

Result: 实验表明，异构MoA在性能和参数效率上均优于同质MoE-LoRA方法。

Conclusion: MoA通过专家异构化有效提升了PEFT方法的性能，为LLM应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Result: 在多种数学、常识和科学问答基准测试中，DynamicMind表现出卓越的零样本问答能力，同时平衡性能与计算效率。

Conclusion: DynamicMind通过三模式思维系统有效解决了LLM在动态适应任务复杂度方面的挑战，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 情感支持对话中，模糊的意图可能导致支持策略不当，需明确意图以提升支持效果。

Method: 提出IntentionESC框架定义意图，结合ICECoT机制使LLM模拟人类推理，生成更有效的支持响应。

Result: 开发自动化标注流程和评估方案，实验验证框架有效性。

Conclusion: IntentionESC和ICECoT显著提升情感支持对话的质量和效果。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Motivation: 解决传统手动创建数学应用题耗时且现有深度学习技术需要额外输入的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成MWP，实验了不同LLM、提示策略、多样性增强技术及人类反馈优化技术。

Result: 生成的MWP质量高，拼写和语法问题少，但在年级和题型适配性上仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLM在MWP生成中表现优异，但需进一步优化以适应特定年级和题型要求。

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时方法专注于世界状态变化的场景，而SoO前缀方法减少了对上下文的假设，适用于更广泛的情境。

Method: SoO前缀方法通过在LLM输出前添加“Let's put ourselves in A's shoes”前缀，其中A为目标角色名称。

Result: 在两种不涉及世界状态变化的基准测试中，SoO前缀显著提升了LLMs在五种心理状态类别中的ToM表现。

Conclusion: SoO前缀通过引发忠实思考，有效提升了LLMs的ToM性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility

Method: 结合OCR、文本提取和人工验证构建数据集，测试LLMs在不同类型问题上的表现，并进行跨语言实验。

Result: LLMs在国际问题上准确率80-95%，文化特定问题上仅50-75%，翻译和文化适应对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 文化背景和数据来源对LLMs性能至关重要，需开发更具文化意识的多语言NLP系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Result: CoT效果评估指标准确率达89.2%，Dynamic CoT减少35%以上token消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为CoT机制提供新视角，并提出高效部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的递归思维能力有限，尤其是在缺乏专家策划数据的情况下，需要一种新方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: AvR通过引入一个结合批评和改进动作的细化过程，利用可微分学习技术优化细化感知奖励，生成多轮数据并组织为长链思维。

Result: 实验显示，AvR仅用3k合成样本就将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升了20%以上。

Conclusion: AvR方法有效提升了LLMs的递归推理能力，为长链思维的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有代理搜索方法存在优化不足、评估成本高和搜索效率低的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出分层搜索空间、预测性能模型和分层MCTS策略，结合任务描述高效搜索。

Result: 在七个基准测试中平均性能提升8.34%，搜索效率更高。

Conclusion: 框架有效解决了代理设计中的挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

Method: SR-DCR结合了令牌级自信与非对称多代理辩论，通过无上下文的批评者挑战辩护者，法官模型评估辩论并决定上下文可靠性。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR显著提升了对误导上下文的鲁棒性，同时保持对可信输入的准确性，优于传统辩论和仅依赖自信的基线方法。

Conclusion: SR-DCR是一种高效且计算开销低的方法，能有效解决大语言模型中的上下文冲突问题。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at

TL;DR: FEEDER是一种新的预选框架，通过高效选择代表性示例来提升上下文学习（ICL）和微调LLMs的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法因重复检索大规模数据集导致高计算成本，需改进。

Method: 提出FEEDER框架，引入“充分性”和“必要性”指标及树状算法，预选代表性示例。

Result: 实验表明，FEEDER可将训练数据减少20%以上，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: FEEDER高效且兼容性强，适用于多种下游演示选择策略。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多模态自动定理证明基准（MATP-BENCH），用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态定理证明中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型作为自动定理证明器的潜力，填补现有研究在多模态领域的空白。

Method: 构建了一个包含1056个多模态定理的基准（MATP-BENCH），涵盖高中、大学和竞赛数学，并支持Lean 4、Coq和Isabelle等定理证明框架。

Result: 现有方法仅能解决MATP-BENCH中的部分问题，表明该基准对自动定理证明研究提出了开放挑战。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为多模态自动定理证明提供了新的评估标准，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

TL;DR: CatShift是一种仅依赖标签的数据集推断框架，利用LLM的灾难性遗忘特性，通过微调检测可疑数据集的成员资格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模型内部log概率，但许多LLM已隐藏或混淆这些信号，亟需不依赖内部logits的标签方法。

Method: CatShift通过微调可疑数据集，观察模型输出的显著变化，与已知非成员验证集对比，统计判断数据集是否曾被训练。

Result: 实验证明CatShift在无法访问logits的情况下仍有效，适用于开源和API-based LLM。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

TL;DR: 联邦微调大语言模型（FedLLMs）在保护数据隐私的同时提升模型性能，但其记忆能力使其易受训练数据提取攻击。本文提出针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法，在更现实的威胁模型下评估其风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FedLLMs在隐私敏感领域中的潜在数据提取风险，填补现有攻击方法在现实威胁模型下的空白。

Method: 设计针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法，利用攻击者持有的上下文前缀跨客户端提取未见的个人身份信息（PII）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可提取高达56.57%的受害者专属PII，其中“地址”、“生日”和“姓名”最易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对鲁棒防御策略的迫切需求，并为隐私保护联邦学习提供了新基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于任务条件概率分布的方法（ATC），用于零样本检测LLM生成的代码，无需原始任务提示或生成模型，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码检测对安全、知识产权和学术诚信至关重要，但现有方法在区分生成代码和人工代码时效果有限。

Method: 通过近似原始任务条件（ATC），评估代码片段在任务条件下的令牌级熵，利用任务条件概率分布差异进行检测。

Result: ATC在多种编程语言（如Python、CPP、Java）的基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 任务级条件对LLM生成代码检测至关重要，ATC方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

TL;DR: MIRIAD是一个大规模、经过整理的医学QA对语料库，旨在通过结构化知识提升LLMs在医疗领域的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖非结构化医学文本，存在噪音和难以利用的问题，需要系统化方法优化知识组织。

Method: 采用半自动化流程（LLM生成、过滤、基于同行评审文献的标注）构建5,821,948个医学QA对。

Result: MIRIAD使LLMs在医学QA基准测试中准确率提升6.7%，检测幻觉能力提高22.5-37%。

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗领域的LLM应用提供了更可靠的知识基础，支持多种下游应用。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

TL;DR: 研究通过强化学习优化大型语言模型生成SQL查询的能力，利用数据库执行反馈提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过与数据库引擎交互而非监督微调来优化模型生成SQL查询的能力。

Method: 将问题建模为强化学习任务，使用执行反馈作为标量奖励，结合GRPO框架进行优化。

Result: RL-tuning将SQL生成准确率从31.49提升至49.83，错误率从25.43%降至14.71%，接近更大模型性能。

Conclusion: 执行反馈可有效提升LLM的符号推理能力。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通常依赖聚合标签（如多数投票），可能掩盖主观标注中的人类分歧。研究旨在探索LLMs是否能反映多视角和标注者分歧。

Method: 使用上下文学习（ICL）在零样本和少样本设置下评估四种开源LLMs，采用三种标签建模策略（聚合硬标签、分解硬标签和软标签），并评估演示选择方法（文本相似性、标注分歧、组合排名和示例排序策略）。

Result: 零样本设置下多视角生成可行，但少样本设置难以全面捕捉人类判断。提示设计和演示选择显著影响性能，示例排序影响有限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在建模主观性时的挑战，强调了构建更具视角感知和社会智能模型的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

Motivation: 端到端语音识别模型依赖高质量标注数据，但新近或不常见的电影标题可能训练不足，导致识别效果差。

Method: 系统包括语音搜索生成替代方案和重打分组件，结合两者选择最终输出。

Result: 在电影标题基准测试中，词错误率相对降低了4.4%至7.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音识别系统对罕见内容的识别能力。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Motivation: 探索NLI模型在细粒度语用推理（尤其是条件句中的预设）上的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入CONFER数据集，评估四种NLI模型和多种LLMs在零样本和少样本提示下的表现。

Result: NLI模型在条件句的预设推理上表现较差，且微调现有数据集未能提升性能。

Conclusion: NLI模型在处理条件句预设推理时存在局限性，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

Result: 三种掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入显示出预期的敏感性，验证了工具的有效性。

Conclusion: semantic-features库在研究语言模型语义解释方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在图表描述转代码任务中持续存在的执行错误问题，探索是否源于模型限制或单提示设计。

Method: 采用多代理流程，分离起草、执行、修复和判断步骤，仅使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型。

Result: 在Text2Chart31和ChartX基准测试中，执行错误率分别降至4.5%和4.6%，但发现图表美观性和可访问性不足。

Conclusion: 未来工作应转向提升图表的美观性、语义保真度和可访问性，而非仅关注执行可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Conclusion: 在小型语言模型中，将专家知识融入提示比CoT技术更有效。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined

iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains,
yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This
position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate
theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with
domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics
-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in
physics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于提示的数据增强技术（DDA和CSE）以及集成策略，用于解决在线性别歧视检测中的数据稀疏性和语言微妙性问题，并在EDOS数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线性别歧视检测面临数据稀疏性和语言微妙性两大挑战，现有模型在数据不平衡和细粒度分类上表现不佳。

Method: 提出定义数据增强（DDA）和上下文语义扩展（CSE）两种技术，并结合多语言模型集成策略。

Result: 在EDOS数据集上，二元分类（Task A）和细粒度分类（Task C）的宏F1分别提升1.5和4.1分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了性别歧视检测中的关键问题，并在性能上达到最新水平。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

*Yi Sui,Chaozhuo Li,Chen Zhang,Dawei song,Qiuchi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSSP-RAG框架通过混合注意力机制解决LLMs中外部与参数化知识的冲突，提升检索增强生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在外部知识与LLMs参数化知识冲突时性能下降，缺乏解决机制。

Method: 提出DSSP-RAG框架，采用混合注意力区分共享与私有语义，引入无监督幻觉检测和能量商（EQ）降噪。

Result: 实验证明DSSP-RAG能有效解决冲突，增强双流知识互补性，性能优于基线。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG通过混合注意力与降噪机制，显著提升RAG的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

*Sabri Eyuboglu,Ryan Ehrlich,Simran Arora,Neel Guha,Dylan Zinsley,Emily Liu,Will Tennien,Atri Rudra,James Zou,Azalia Mirhoseini,Christopher Re*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cartridge的方法，通过离线训练较小的KV缓存来替代传统的大语言模型上下文学习（ICL），显著降低了内存消耗和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理长上下文时，内存消耗和推理成本高昂，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Cartridge方法，通过离线训练KV缓存，并使用自学习（self-study）生成合成对话以优化训练目标。

Result: Cartridge在性能上与ICL相当，但内存消耗减少38.6倍，吞吐量提高26.4倍，并扩展了有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridge结合自学习是一种高效且可扩展的替代方案，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdvSumm是一个对抗性训练框架，旨在通过改进泛化能力减少文本摘要中的偏见，同时保持摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本摘要中表现优异，但继承了预训练数据中的偏见，导致下游任务输出不公平。

Method: AdvSumm引入Perturber组件，在序列到序列模型的嵌入层应用梯度引导扰动，增强模型对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Result: AdvSumm有效减少了名称-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见，且不损害摘要质量，优于标准Transformer和数据增强方法。

Conclusion: AdvSumm为减少文本摘要中的偏见提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

*Souradip Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4V在零样本设置下表现出色（准确率超85%），尤其在图像拼接检测任务中，通过Chain-of-Thought提示策略表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GPT-4V在图像取证领域的零样本能力，特别是检测图像拼接篡改的潜力。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本、思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集子集上评估GPT-4V。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下准确率超85%，思维链提示表现最均衡。模型能结合低级视觉特征和上下文知识检测篡改。

Conclusion: 尽管不及专用模型，GPT-4V的通用性、可解释性和推理能力使其成为图像取证中的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Conclusion: 该研究为CO₂排放分析提供了高效工具，尤其在畜牧业应用中具有潜力，同时轻量级设计适合资源受限平台。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on
livestock applications.

TL;DR: STFlow是一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术虽强大，但受限于低通量和实验设施需求。现有预测方法未能有效建模细胞间相互作用且面临内存问题。

Method: 提出STFlow模型，采用流匹配生成方法建模全切片基因表达联合分布，并设计高效的切片级编码器与局部空间注意力机制。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过改进建模方式和内存效率，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种种子选择方法，通过多候选种子优化图像质量，避免额外比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法使用单一随机种子可能导致图像质量不佳，需改进。

Method: 基于反向扩散早期中间输出，选择最优种子以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多项指标上优于基线。

Conclusion: 种子选择方法有效提升图像质量且不增加比特率。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合先验知识和优化策略，成功实现了高质量的立体图像生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述作为独立任务优化，导致模型在评分准确性和解释性之间存在权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏高质量数据；强化学习阶段引入新奖励机制（GRPO）联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提升6.5%，且在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于基于描述的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Q-Ponder框架成功统一了评分和推理任务，展示了在多样化任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，缺乏对动态3D空间推理的研究。

Method: SAVVY采用两阶段训练无关推理流程：1) 利用AV-LLMs跟踪关键物体轨迹；2) 构建全局动态地图并通过坐标转换回答问题。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能，为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法填补了动态3D空间推理的空白，推动了AV-LLMs的发展。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了状态估计问题，提升了策略性能和控制的稳定性。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for optimal policy design in dynamic
systems. However, obtaining true system states is often impractical or
infeasible, complicating the policy learning process. This paper introduces a
novel neural architecture that integrates spatial feature extraction using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and temporal modeling through gated
recurrent units (GRUs), enabling effective state representation from sequences
of images and corresponding actions. These learned state representations are
used to train a reinforcement learning agent with a Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables real-time,
accurate estimation and control without direct access to ground-truth states.
Additionally, we provide a quantitative evaluation methodology for assessing
the accuracy of the learned states, highlighting their impact on policy
performance and control stability.

Result: 提出的判别网络能够有效检测伪造内容，并开发了一个平台供用户使用。

Conclusion: 该研究为法医领域提供了检测伪造视频和隐藏犯罪证据的工具，有助于识别犯罪活动。

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence
towards the identification of criminal activities.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物特征人脸认证在不同人口群体中的公平性和泛化性问题。

Method: 结合ViT和ResNet的全局特征，设计少样本原型网络，并在自定义数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: Microsoft Swin Transformer在任务中表现最佳，性能随支持集大小增加而提升。

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平性和泛化性上表现良好，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2SAM通过结合文本提示改进复杂形状物体的分割，显著提升了SAM-HQ在细长结构和精细边界上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在处理复杂形状物体（如电线、自行车等）时表现不佳，尤其是细长结构和精细边界的分割效果较差。

Method: Talk2SAM利用CLIP嵌入的用户文本提示识别语义区域，并将其投影到DINO特征空间，作为SAM-HQ的额外提示，增强目标对象的分割能力。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K三个基准测试中，Talk2SAM比SAM-HQ表现更优，IoU和边界IoU分别提升5.9%和8.3%。

Conclusion: Talk2SAM通过自然语言指导提供了一种灵活且有效的方法，显著提升了复杂形状物体的分割精度。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

Result: 在Waymo和CODA数据集及实际车辆平台上测试，最大延迟降低57.58%，检测精度提升44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE框架有效解决了VLMs在自动驾驶中的实时性问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的神经网络解释存在概念不一致问题，且缺乏用户反馈机制，导致解释与用户理解不匹配。

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户监督调整和拆分原型部分（视觉概念），以适应用户偏好。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证，YoursProtoP实现了概念一致性且不影响模型准确性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致问题，并通过用户交互提升了模型解释的可理解性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment
workflows.

TL;DR: ODIS是一种预训练方法，通过对象级自蒸馏改进视觉表示，解决了传统图像级自蒸馏在多对象场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像级自蒸馏假设每张图像仅含单一对象，限制了其在多对象或场景级数据集上的扩展性。ODIS旨在通过对象级自蒸馏提升视觉表示的质量。

Method: ODIS利用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力隔离对象区域，将复杂的场景级任务分解为简单的对象级子任务。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large模型上实现了82.6%的ImageNet1k k-NN准确率，显著提升了图像和补丁级别的视觉表示。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏有效提升了视觉表示的质量，尤其在多对象场景中表现优异。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Motivation: 视线推断是人类自然交互的关键能力，研究旨在评估VLMs是否具备类似能力。

Method: 通过控制实验比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和变异性照片中的表现，并使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不如随机猜测，人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的VLMs受任务难度影响但对感知变化稳健。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏视线推断能力，但仍有潜力成为自然交互技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Motivation: STEP格式需要CAD内核处理，限制了其在大规模学习管道中的使用，尤其是计算集群上的部署。

Method: 开发了基于HDF5的开放格式和配套开源库，支持数据查询和处理，并提供了标准功能如采样、法线和曲率计算。

Result: 成功转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集，并通过四个标准用例验证了数据的完整性和兼容性。

Conclusion: HDF5格式有效解决了STEP格式的局限性，为CAD数据在机器学习中的应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

Result: 在三个代表性的人-物交互基准上验证了方法的有效性，并在两个基准上取得了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、通用且有效，为人-物交互分类任务提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object
features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query
learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories,
converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,
and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is
motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the
first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification
task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three
representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习中，图像观察可能包含干扰元素（如阴影、云层、光线），且这些干扰在训练中可能未暴露，因此需要高效且鲁棒的表示方法。

Method: SPD通过并行使用弱增强和强增强，并通过预测双向增强版本之间的逆向和正向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观察中表现优于先前研究，并显著提升未见观察的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法在视觉强化学习中有效提取任务相关特征，尤其在面对未暴露干扰时表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

Conclusion: YOEO方法高效且实用，适用于实时机器人操作任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dr. G的自监督方法，用于零样本模型强化学习，通过双对比学习和递归状态逆动力学模型提升对视觉干扰的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MBRL算法在面对视觉干扰时性能下降的问题，适应现实场景中的任务无关干扰。

Method: 使用双对比学习训练编码器和世界模型，引入递归状态逆动力学模型以增强时间结构理解。

Result: 在DeepMind Control和Robosuite中，Dr. G分别比现有方法性能提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提升了MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is
open-sourced and available at https://github.com/JeongsooHa/DrG.git

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决自动驾驶中传感器数据延迟问题的新方法，通过时间戳偏移和数据增强策略提升感知系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器数据延迟导致的时间错位会影响自动驾驶感知系统的性能，尤其是轨迹预测的准确性，这对安全性至关重要。

Method: 采用每点时间戳偏移特征和数据增强策略，模拟实际部署中的传感器延迟模式，并将其集成到多传感器检测模型中。

Result: 传统模型在传感器数据延迟时性能显著下降，而新方法在同步和延迟条件下均表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决传感器数据延迟问题，提升自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于原始RF信号的高效轻量级单阶段MPPE模型，通过分组和共享CNN结合多头注意力，性能优于现有方法，并提出新的自监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RF-based MPPE方法中预处理复杂或性能不足的问题。

Result: PCKh@0.5指标提升15%，自监督学习显著提升新场景和多人场景性能。

Conclusion: 模型高效且性能优越，自监督学习增强泛化能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类社交互动的复杂性和多模态特性对人工智能提出了巨大挑战，需要更先进的评估工具来推动研究。

Method: 通过2,792个视频片段和8,792个问题-答案对，结合人类-LLM协作流程，构建了SIV-Bench数据集。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在SSU上表现良好，但在SSR和SDP上表现不佳，尤其是关系推理（RI）成为瓶颈。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解，并确认了转录对话对理解复杂社交互动的重要性。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Method: 训练一个代理模型，输入图像和文本，生成联合表示，并进一步生成对抗性扰动。

Result: 提出的协调攻击策略在多模态攻击和单模态攻击中表现优异，成功降低了多个先进预训练模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了视觉语言模型在多模态扰动下的脆弱性，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了参考。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频分类模型鲁棒性评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉表征提供语义信息，语言解码器能补偿视觉表征的不足。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型中存在动态分工，未来可设计更多视觉处理由语言解码器承担。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Conclusion: 该方法为VLM提供了更具针对性和可解释性的评估框架。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Result: FastDrive在结构化数据集上性能提升20%，推理速度提高10倍以上。

Conclusion: 结构化数据和高效模型设计显著提升了自动驾驶任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote

learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

Result: RADAR在BBC-PAIR基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法，能检测到已知和未知扩散模型的编辑。

Abstract: Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically
alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion
models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the
door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an
important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To
this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,

Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示（如体素或高斯分布），效率低且难以捕捉动态场景。S2GO旨在通过稀疏查询解决这些问题。

Method: 将场景总结为一组紧凑的3D查询，动态传播并解码为语义高斯分布，结合去噪渲染目标优化查询和分布。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中，S2GO以1.5 IoU优势超越GaussianWorld，推理速度快5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在3D占用预测中具有高效性和灵活性，为动态场景建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate

This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and

significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的反射具有多样性和复杂性，现有方法难以有效处理，因此需要一种更强大的技术来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用U形架构，结合快速傅里叶变换（FFT）Transformer块和分层Transformer块，利用全局频率域信息和多尺度特征提取。

Result: 在三个公开测试数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构在SIRR任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有自回归模型在细粒度文本-图像对齐上表现不佳，无法实现精确的视觉控制。

Method: 构建包含相似表达但局部语义不同的文本-图像对数据集，并设计强化学习算法强调细粒度差异。

Result: FocusDiff在现有基准和PairComp上均取得最优性能。

Conclusion: FocusDiff通过关注细粒度差异，显著提升了文本-图像生成的对齐精度。

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

TL;DR: MORSE-500是一个新的视频基准测试，旨在解决现有多模态推理基准的三个不足：静态图像依赖、狭窄的数学问题聚焦和快速饱和。它包含500个脚本化视频片段，覆盖六类推理能力，并通过可控生成支持持续挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在多模态推理中存在不足，如静态图像、狭窄的数学问题聚焦和快速饱和，无法全面评估模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用Python脚本（Manim、Matplotlib、MoviePy）、生成视频模型和真实片段，程序化生成500个视频片段，覆盖六类推理问题，并通过可控生成支持难度调整。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3）在所有推理类别中表现不足，尤其在抽象和规划任务中差距显著。

Conclusion: MORSE-500通过动态生成和多样化问题，为多模态推理研究提供了透明、可复现且可持续的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Motivation: 现有图像编码器（如DINO或CLIP）缺乏时间感知，而视频模型（如VideoMAE）在密集预测任务中表现不佳，FRAME旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FRAME通过自监督学习预测当前和未来的DINO块特征，生成时空精确且一致的表示，并支持语言驱动任务。

Result: 在七个数据集的六个密集预测任务中，FRAME表现优于图像编码器和现有自监督视频模型。

Conclusion: FRAME是首个在密集预测任务中优于图像编码器的视频编码器，同时保持紧凑架构，适用于多种下游应用。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Motivation: 当前3D技术在动态现象（如移动物体分割）中表现不佳，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Layered Motion Fusion方法，融合2D运动分割预测到分层辐射场，并通过测试时细化降低数据复杂度。

Result: 3D模型的分割预测显著优于2D基线，证明3D技术可增强动态现象的2D分析。

Conclusion: 3D技术即使在动态和复杂场景中也能有效提升2D分析效果。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Motivation: LMMs在视觉感知和推理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理视觉模糊或无意义的场景文本时容易产生语义幻觉（即生成语义合理但视觉错误的答案）。

Method: 提出了一种训练免费的框架，包括ZoomText（一种从粗到细的文本区域识别策略）和Grounded Layer Correction（利用不易产生幻觉的层内部表示来指导解码）。

Result: 在TextHalu-Bench基准测试中，该方法有效缓解了语义幻觉，并在场景文本识别和理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了LMMs的语义幻觉问题，还在公开基准测试中展现了强大的性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法在极端视角下常出现几何不一致和遮挡伪影，导致视觉质量下降。

Method: 提出深度水密网格表示作为几何先验，结合模拟掩码策略生成训练数据，并使用LoRA适配器合成视频。

Result: EX-4D在物理一致性和极端视角质量上优于现有方法，实现了实用的4D视频生成。

Conclusion: EX-4D为极端视角下的高质量视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

Motivation: 现有方法（如SLAM结合3DGS）在宽基线和大场景中表现不佳，且计算耗时。

Method: 采用快速初始姿态估计和直接采样高斯基元位置与形状，结合渐进式聚类和锚点存储。

Result: 能够在拍摄后立即处理各种场景和拍摄风格，速度和图像质量均具竞争力。

Conclusion: 方法高效且鲁棒，适用于实时大规模场景重建。

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上均表现出性能提升，尤其在复杂退化图像上效果显著。

Conclusion: UniRes框架通过结合专门模型知识，有效解决了复杂退化问题，具有灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过任务定义和动态平衡机制，显著提升了Real-SR的性能。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

TL;DR: TissUnet是一种深度学习模型，用于从常规三维T1加权MRI中分割颅外组织，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅外组织在脑MRI中可能对健康评估和临床决策有重要价值，但现有工具验证不足。

Method: TissUnet基于155对MRI-CT扫描训练，并在多个数据集中验证，包括健康成人和脑肿瘤患者。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人中Dice系数中位数为0.79，在专家标注数据中为0.83，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TissUnet能快速、准确地分割颅外组织，支持大规模研究。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型基准缺乏场景多样性、可靠的动作级标注和符合人类偏好的评估协议，DriveAction旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用真实驾驶数据生成QA对，提供高级离散动作标签，并采用动作根植的树状评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的VLM模型需视觉和语言输入才能准确预测动作，缺失任一项均导致准确率下降。

Conclusion: DriveAction为自动驾驶中类人决策提供了新见解和严格基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

TL;DR: MoralCLIP是一种新的嵌入表示方法，通过基于道德基础理论（MFT）的多模态学习，解决了现有视觉语言模型缺乏道德维度理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态语义理解上表现优异，但缺乏对道德维度的解释和推理能力，这是人类认知的关键方面。

Method: MoralCLIP通过整合视觉和文本道德线索到统一的嵌入空间，实现跨模态道德对齐。使用多标签数据集Social-Moral Image Database识别视觉内容中的道德基础，并通过道德数据增强策略扩展数据集至15,000个图像-文本对。

Result: 实验表明，显式的道德监督提升了单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解，为具备道德意识的AI系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为识别和与人类道德价值观对齐的AI系统提供了新的方法，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的Token Transforming框架，统一了现有的token压缩方法，减少了信息损失，实现了无需训练的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉Transformer计算成本高，现有token压缩方法（如剪枝或合并）导致信息丢失且需后训练恢复性能，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 将token压缩统一为显式的token矩阵变换，提出多对多的Token Transforming框架，保留更多信息并支持免训练加速。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少40% FLOPs，DeiT-S加速1.5倍，精度仅下降0.1%，并在密集预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更好的计算-性能权衡，显著降低了计算成本和推理时间。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中多边形近似评估指标的选择问题，明确加权FOM和Rosin's measure是否可互换。

Method: 通过理论分析（数学公式和定理证明）、实验（公开数据集）和统计（Pearson相关系数）验证两种指标的独立性。

Result: 理论、实验和统计均表明两种指标无关联，无法互相替代。

Conclusion: 加权FOM不能替代Rosin's measure，评估结果可能因指标选择而异。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

Abstract: We present a method for 3D ball trajectory estimation from a 2D tracking

LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is
independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of
intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection
consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets
and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite
training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple
trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual
replay. Please visit our page: https://where-is-the-ball.github.io.

Motivation: 人类容易受到光学错觉的影响，这为研究感官和认知过程提供了工具。研究试图验证机器是否也有类似现象。

Method: 引入一个分类为真实和虚假错觉的VQA数据集，并评估LVLMs在区分实际和表象特征上的表现。

Result: LVLMs对真实和虚假错觉的回答相同，表明其可能基于先验知识而非真正的视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs可能并未真正理解视觉错觉，而是依赖先验知识回答问题。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Result: 在四个3D血管分割数据集上验证了方法的有效性和优越性，临床可视化结果显著。

Conclusion: DeformCL在血管提取中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种UNet类网络，为医学图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

TL;DR: FontAdapter是一个快速生成未见字体视觉文本的框架，通过两阶段课程学习实现高效字体定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对预设字典外的字体适应耗时且不实用，需改进以实现实时定制。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：先提取字体属性，再整合到自然背景中；构建合成数据集支持训练。

Result: FontAdapter无需额外微调即可高质量定制未见字体，支持多种字体编辑任务。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个高效、多功能的字体定制框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Motivation: 现有视频虚拟试穿方法难以保持连续性和服装细节，ChronoTailor旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用区域感知空间引导和注意力驱动的时间特征融合，结合多尺度服装特征和姿态对齐，确保时空连续性。

Result: 实验表明，ChronoTailor在保持时空连续性和服装细节方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的时空注意力机制和多尺度特征整合，实现了高质量的视频虚拟试穿效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Motivation: 提高皮肤点刺试验（SPT）的检测一致性和准确性，通过自动化方法减少人为误差。

Method: 使用SPAT设备的32张多光照图像，结合神经网络分割和算法检测，对10,416个手动标注的过敏反应区域进行分析。

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，多光照图像比单光照图像显著提高了检测准确性。

Conclusion: 多光照条件下的SPAT图像比传统单光照图像更准确，适合临床过敏检测。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

TL;DR: CryoFastAR是一种几何基础模型，用于直接从无序的冷冻电镜图像预测姿态，显著加速了蛋白质的初始重建过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜中的姿态估计和3D重建仍依赖耗时的迭代优化，主要由于低信噪比和对比传递函数畸变等挑战。

Method: 通过整合多视图特征并在大规模模拟数据上训练，结合渐进式训练策略，提高模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，CryoFastAR在合成和真实数据集上均显著加速推理，同时保持与传统方法相当的重建质量。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为冷冻电镜中的快速初始重建提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Domain-RAG框架，通过检索引导生成域一致的图像，解决跨域少样本目标检测中的域对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强和生成方法在跨域少样本目标检测中难以保持视觉真实性和域对齐，Domain-RAG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Domain-RAG分为三个阶段：域感知背景检索、域引导背景生成和前景-背景组合，无需额外训练即可生成高质量样本。

Result: 实验表明，Domain-RAG在多个任务中优于基线方法，并取得新的最优结果。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG是一种无需训练的高效框架，能生成域一致的样本，显著提升跨域少样本目标检测性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HMVLM通过创新架构和升级技术，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的决策能力和性能。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025

Motivation: 现有方法在细粒度一致性探索不足，导致篡改感知能力有限。

Method: 采用双分支结构（图像和文本），分别包含CCD和SCD解码器，捕捉模态内和跨模态一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上取得最优性能，尤其在篡改内容定位方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习显著提升了篡改检测和定位的能力。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中至关重要，但现有方法（如纯Transformer模型）在中小型器官上表现不佳且计算资源需求高。

Method: 采用Mask2Former结合可变形注意力，提出偏移调整策略以优化采样点位置，并利用第4特征图和FCN辅助头加速训练。

Result: 模型在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其在中小型器官上表现突出。

Conclusion: 改进的Mask2Former模型有效解决了医学图像分割中的资源消耗和中小型器官分割难题，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督语义分割的评估仅关注准确性，忽视了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些特性对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)指标，通过调和平均值结合预测准确性、校准性和不确定性质量，全面评估模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，半监督方法在准确性上可能牺牲可靠性，而UniMatchV2在域外评估中表现出鲁棒性但仍存在可靠性不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用RSS等更全面的评估指标，以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

Motivation: 现有图像扩散模型在视频动态编辑（如运动调整）中表现不足，而视频扩散模型虽能生成高质量结果，但直接应用图像编辑技术时计算成本过高。

Method: 通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，揭示视频先验分布，提出分解策略优化各组件功能，并设计频谱引导调制以细化采样轨迹。

Conclusion: FADE是一种高效、通用的视频编辑方法，无需额外训练即可充分利用预训练模型的先验知识。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 现有基于NeRF或3D高斯点云的SLAM方法在动态场景中表现不佳，尤其是仅依赖RGB输入时。Dy3DGS-SLAM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出融合光流和深度掩码的概率模型生成动态掩码，设计运动损失约束位姿估计网络，并利用渲染损失消除动态干扰。

Result: 实验显示Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中实现了最先进的跟踪和渲染性能，优于或匹配现有RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景SLAM提供了一种高效的单目RGB解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

### [182] [MCA-Bench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating CAPTCHA Robustness Against VLM-based Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05982)
*Zonglin Wu,Yule Xue,Xin Wei,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MCA-Bench，一个多模态CAPTCHA基准测试套件，用于评估CAPTCHA的安全性，并提出设计原则和开放挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案多样但缺乏统一的评估基准，无法全面评估其安全性。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型框架，为每类CAPTCHA微调专用破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: MCA-Bench揭示了现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞谱，并首次量化分析了挑战复杂性、交互深度和模型可解性之间的关系。

Conclusion: 提出了三项设计原则和开放挑战，为CAPTCHA加固、公平基准测试和社区合作奠定基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

*Yifu Qiu,Yftah Ziser,Anna Korhonen,Shay B. Cohen,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉与语言基础模型是否具备现实世界模型和动态模型的能力，发现动态模型更容易通过监督学习获得，并提出了两种策略来引导世界模型的构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉与语言基础模型是否能够模拟现实世界和动态行为，尤其是在语言表达动作的情况下。

Method: 通过监督学习微调模型以获取动态模型，并利用动态模型通过弱监督学习和推理时验证两种策略引导世界模型的构建。

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench上的动作中心图像编辑任务中表现优异，性能提升15%，并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以有效地引导世界模型的构建，且在图像编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案，适用于实际临床部署。

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率输入下，立体视频生成的质量和数量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法在小规模合成数据集上微调后，可应用于低质量真实视频，实现立体生成与修复。

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种样本特定的噪声注入框架（SSNI），通过预训练的评分网络动态调整噪声水平，显著提升了扩散净化方法的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散净化方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，而研究发现不同样本需要不同的噪声水平，尤其是干净样本应注入较少噪声。

Method: SSNI利用预训练评分网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度（评分范数），并基于评分范数动态调整噪声水平。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上，SSNI显著提升了现有扩散净化方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 样本特定的噪声注入是扩散净化方法的关键改进方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: HAVIR通过结合AutoKL和CLIP适配器，从fMRI数据中重建复杂视觉刺激的结构和语义信息，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大脑活动中重建视觉信息是神经科学与计算机视觉的桥梁，但复杂视觉刺激的准确恢复仍具挑战性。

Method: HAVIR包含两个适配器：AutoKL适配器将fMRI体素转换为潜在扩散先验，捕捉拓扑结构；CLIP适配器将体素转换为CLIP文本和图像嵌入，融合语义信息。

Result: 实验表明，HAVIR能有效重建复杂场景中的结构和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR通过互补表示融合，成功解决了复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于“角树”的线性成本张量处理层（FIS），适用于图像和高阶张量数据，性能接近大型模型但参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量数据在深度学习中的普遍性需要高效的子二次处理层。

Method: 利用“角树”和多重参数化的迭代积分签名，构建FIS层，适用于分类和异常检测任务。

Result: 在小型ResNet中替换部分层，精度接近大型模型（差异0.1%），参数和计算量减少；异常检测模型在MVTec AD数据集上AUROC达97.3%。

Conclusion: FIS层高效且通用，适用于多种任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN的红外小目标检测方法忽视了浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，且缺乏对跨层次特征依赖关系的系统建模，限制了检测性能和计算效率。

Method: SDS-Net采用双分支架构分别建模特征的结构特性和语义属性，并引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，SDS-Net在检测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDS-Net通过高效的特征建模和融合机制，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Motivation: 尽管VLMs在医学图像分析中表现出强大的判别能力，但其可靠性尚未得到充分研究。论文旨在解决零样本性能有限和传统方法无法满足严格交换性假设的问题。

Method: 提出全适应校准（full conformal adaptation）框架，结合SS-Text方法，通过少量样本适应集对每个测试数据点进行转换。

Result: 在3种医学VLM和9个适应任务中，框架在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，将集合效率相对提高了27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学图像分析中的VLMs提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案，同时保持了理论保证。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展；现有视觉语言模型因缺乏领域知识，在小麦任务中表现不佳。

Method: 构建WisWheat数据集，包含预训练、定量测量和指令微调三层数据，用于微调开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B模型在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中分别达到79.2%和84.6%的准确率，显著优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集有效提升了视觉语言模型在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业智能化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Motivation: CFG固定引导可能导致样本多样性下降和记忆化问题，FBG旨在通过动态调节解决这一问题。

Method: FBG通过状态相关系数动态调节引导量，基于条件信号的信息量反馈自适应调整。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上显著优于CFG，与LIG竞争，且在文本到图像生成中自动适应不同复杂度提示。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种数学框架支持的动态引导方法，优于固定引导方案，并可与其他引导方法结合。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因为忽略了长视频由多个镜头组成的关键事实，导致冗余或噪声上下文检索。

Method: 采用链式镜头推理范式，逐步选择和细化相关镜头，模拟人类逐步思考过程。

Result: 在主流长视频QA基准测试中表现最佳，如VideoMME（77.0）和EgoSchema（70.1），显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1通过链式镜头推理有效提升了长视频理解能力，性能接近闭源模型但效率更高。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

*Peter Lengyel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的卷积LSTM架构（CCLSTM），用于预测动态代理的未来状态，解决了现有方法对高质量向量输入和计算密集型Transformer架构的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量向量输入和计算密集的Transformer架构，实际应用中难以满足，因此需要一种更轻量且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出CCLSTM，基于纯卷积操作，无需向量输入或自注意力机制，通过紧凑的循环卷积结构捕捉时空动态和占用流相关性。

Result: CCLSTM在占用流指标上达到最先进性能，并在2024 Waymo挑战赛中所有指标排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案，适用于实际自动驾驶场景中的未来状态预测。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

*David Wan,Han Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Jaemin Cho,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLaMR是一种多模态视频检索系统，通过动态选择最佳模态提升检索效果，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统将多模态视为独立源，导致检索效果不佳，需动态选择最佳模态。

Method: 提出CLaMR，联合编码视频帧、语音、文本和元数据，并引入合成数据集MultiVENT 2.0++和模态感知损失函数。

Result: CLaMR在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上表现优异，nDCG@10提升显著。

Conclusion: CLaMR在多模态视频检索中具有显著优势，适用于长视频问答等下游任务。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合高光谱EnMAP数据与Sentinel-2时间序列的双流Transformer架构，用于细粒度作物分类，显著提升了分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度作物分类对精准农业和食品安全监测至关重要，但现有研究因高光谱数据获取和标注成本高而稀缺。

Method: 构建了H2Crop数据集，并提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理高光谱数据的精细光谱特征和Sentinel-2时间序列的作物生长模式。

Result: 实验表明，加入高光谱数据后，F1分数平均提升4.2%，最高达6.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有深度学习模型，高光谱数据在不同时间窗口和作物变化场景中均表现一致优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Motivation: 在线错误检测在工业自动化和教育等领域至关重要，但现有研究多集中于程序性错误，忽略了执行错误，因此需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一个在线错误检测框架，能够同时处理程序性错误和执行错误，并利用大语言模型生成反馈。

Result: 在HoloAssist基准测试中，该方法在错误检测任务中排名第二，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为在线错误检测提供了更全面的解决方案，尤其在处理多种错误类型时表现突出。

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Conclusion: SatelliteFormula填补了数据驱动学习与物理理解之间的鸿沟，实现了复杂环境变量的可解释建模。

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

TL;DR: STSBench是一个基于场景的框架，用于评估自动驾驶中视觉语言模型（VLMs）的整体理解能力，通过多视角和多帧数据生成问题，揭示现有模型在时空推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常针对单视角的图像或视频，专注于语义任务，而忽视了自动驾驶中多视角和时空推理的需求。STSBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 框架自动从数据集中挖掘预定义的交通场景，提供用户界面进行人工验证，并生成多选题用于模型评估。应用于NuScenes数据集，创建了STSnu基准。

Result: STSnu包含43个场景和971个多选题，评估发现现有模型在复杂交通动态推理上存在显著不足。

Conclusion: STSBench为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶VLMs提供了关键工具，强调了时空推理架构改进的紧迫性。

Abstract: We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic
understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

Result: 实验表明，GenIR在多轮心理图像检索任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为心理图像检索任务提供了新的数据集和生成式检索方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在理解长视频内容方面存在局限，现有基准测试多关注细节而非深度理解。

Method: 引入MF$^2$基准，包含50多部电影和850对人工构建的声明对（真/假），评估模型对核心叙事要素的理解。

Result: 实验显示，当前模型表现远低于人类，突显其在关键叙事信息保留和推理能力上的不足。

Conclusion: MF$^2$揭示了现有模型在长视频理解上的缺陷，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Conclusion: 需进一步优化VLMs以适应手术环境的复杂性，为下一代内窥镜AI系统开发提供方向。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Conclusion: 优化配置显著提升了数据加载效率和GPU利用率，同时保持了模型精度，为大规模EO数据训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently

Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像合成中归一化流模型的扩展性和性能问题，结合Transformer的表达能力和归一化流的精确建模。

Method: 提出TARFlow（Transformer Autoregressive Flow），结合深度和浅层Transformer块、潜在空间建模以及新型引导算法，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在类别和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，样本质量接近最先进的扩散模型。

Conclusion: STARFlow首次证明归一化流在大规模高分辨率任务中的有效性，为生成模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

Motivation: 开发一个能够精确理解人类技能的基准测试，以推动视频-语言模型在物理和程序性领域的进步。

Method: 构建包含11项物理活动的3521个视频问答对，要求从五个候选答案中选择正确答案，测试模型对专家级技能的细粒度理解。

Result: GPT-4o模型在ExAct上仅达到44.70%的准确率，远低于人类专家的82.02%。

Conclusion: ExAct有助于开发和评估能够精确理解人类技能的VLMs，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: We present ExAct, a new video-language benchmark for expert-level
understanding of skilled physical human activities. Our new benchmark contains
3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human
specialists/experts. We believe that ExAct will be beneficial for developing
and evaluating VLMs capable of precise understanding of human skills in various
physical and procedural domains. Dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: CoMemo提出了一种双路径架构和新的位置编码机制，解决了大型视觉语言模型在注意力分配和2D结构关系上的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）继承了大型语言模型（LLM）的设计，导致多模态处理中的注意力分配不均和2D结构关系丢失问题。

Method: 提出CoMemo双路径架构（上下文图像路径和图像记忆路径）和RoPE-DHR位置编码机制，以优化视觉信息处理和保持空间关系。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，CoMemo在长上下文理解、多图像推理和视觉问答任务中表现优于传统LVLM架构。

Conclusion: CoMemo通过创新的架构和编码机制，显著提升了多模态处理的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Motivation: 现有基础模型在训练数据的规模、地理覆盖和光谱多样性方面存在局限，影响了全球可迁移表征的学习。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2影像，采用多模态融合、局部-全局对比学习和双中心机制，解决长尾分布问题。

Result: 在GEO-Bench和Copernicus-Bench上，TerraFM在分类和分割任务中表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: TerraFM通过多模态融合和自监督学习策略，显著提升了地球观测任务的泛化性能。

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Motivation: 新冠疫情导致教育模式转向在线平台，非语言沟通的缺失降低了教育效果，需要通过情感分析技术弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 研究包括数据准备、特征选择，并开发了一个结合词嵌入、LSTM和注意力机制的深度神经网络模型，与逻辑回归基线进行比较。

Result: 模型旨在通过情感分析理解学生反馈的情感背景，改善在线教育中师生沟通的效果。

Conclusion: 研究为在线教育提供了一种新的情感分析工具，有望提升教育质量和师生互动。

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Conclusion: 情景构建在计算机科学中具有潜力，尤其是在增强研究包容性方面，但仍需进一步探索其传统用途。

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Result: 用户研究表明，模块化和个性化设计在多模态触觉界面中具有显著效果。

Conclusion: 该系统为动态人机交互环境中的可重构触觉界面提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a customizable soft haptic system that integrates modular hardware
with an information-theoretic algorithm to personalize feedback for different
users and tasks. Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom
pneumatic displays, where different signal types, such as pressure, frequency,
and contact area, can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits.
These circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics
and enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a
compact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic
signal rendering through hardware-level logic switching without rewriting code.
Personalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of
modular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which
display configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as
a signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to
the user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware
setup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and
the user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in
sensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework
through user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays
under different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of
modularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and
advance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in
dynamic human-machine interaction contexts.

Motivation: AI系统带来新能力的同时也引发了一系列伤害，但关于伤害后的修复行动（如谁负责、如何修复）的研究较少。

Method: 通过专题分析开发了一个AI伤害修复的分类法，并将其应用于1060起AI相关事件的数据集。

Result: 修复行动主要集中在早期象征性阶段，缺乏问责或结构性改革。现有修复措施未能提供有意义的补救。

Conclusion: 为推进更负责任的AI修复方法提供了基础。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are integrated into more aspects of
society, they offer new capabilities but also cause a range of harms that are
drawing increasing scrutiny. A large body of work in the Responsible AI
community has focused on identifying and auditing these harms. However, much
less is understood about what happens after harm occurs: what constitutes
reparation, who initiates it, and how effective these reparations are. In this
paper, we develop a taxonomy of AI harm reparation based on a thematic analysis
of real-world incidents. The taxonomy organizes reparative actions into four
overarching goals: acknowledging harm, attributing responsibility, providing
remedies, and enabling systemic change. We apply this framework to a dataset of
1,060 AI-related incidents, analyzing the prevalence of each action and the
distribution of stakeholder involvement. Our findings show that reparation
efforts are concentrated in early, symbolic stages, with limited actions toward
accountability or structural reform. Drawing on theories of justice, we argue
that existing responses fall short of delivering meaningful redress. This work
contributes a foundation for advancing more accountable and reparative
approaches to Responsible AI.

Abstract: Earable devices, wearables positioned in or around the ear, are undergoing a
rapid transformation from audio-centric accessories into multifunctional
systems for interaction, contextual awareness, and health monitoring. This
evolution is driven by commercial trends emphasizing sensor integration and by
a surge of academic interest exploring novel sensing capabilities. Building on
the foundation established by earlier surveys, this work presents a timely and
comprehensive review of earable research published since 2022. We analyze over
one hundred recent studies to characterize this shifting research landscape,
identify emerging applications and sensing modalities, and assess progress
relative to prior efforts. In doing so, we address three core questions: how
has earable research evolved in recent years, what enabling resources are now
available, and what opportunities remain for future exploration. Through this
survey, we aim to provide both a retrospective and forward-looking view of
earable technology as a rapidly expanding frontier in ubiquitous computing. In
particular, this review reveals that over the past three years, researchers
have discovered a variety of novel sensing principles, developed many new
earable sensing applications, enhanced the accuracy of existing sensing tasks,
and created substantial new resources to advance research in the field. Based
on this, we further discuss open challenges and propose future directions for
the next phase of earable research.

Motivation: 联合注意力是早期社交沟通发展的关键指标，但家长难以在没有专家指导的情况下评估。

Method: 通过访谈和视频标注研究提取SLPs评估联合注意力的核心行为线索（注视、动作、发声），并开发了两阶段的MLLM系统：行为描述提取和专家对齐的联合注意力判断。

Result: MLLMs在行为线索提取上达到85%准确率，模拟专家判断的平均精度超过75%。

Conclusion: 研究提供了基于SLP专业知识的结构化行为线索，证明了MLLMs与SLPs对齐的可行性，并为构建支持亲子互动分析的系统提出了设计指南。

Abstract: Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative
development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert
guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists
(SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We
conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three
experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three
core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we
developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained
behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention
quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child
interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in
perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert
judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based
behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the
structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries
grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses
based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This
work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise,
demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using
MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to
support parent-child interaction analysis.

Motivation: 随着视线数据集的增加，数据质量和隐私问题成为挑战，需要一种方法在保证隐私的同时验证数据质量。

Method: QualitEye采用新的语义表示方法，结合公共和隐私保护两种设置，利用私有集合交集协议。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze和GazeCapture数据集上验证性能高，隐私保护版本运行时开销小。

Conclusion: QualitEye为机器学习、人机交互和密码学交叉领域的新视线分析方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Conclusion: HCI因其实践导向研究经验，适合引导设计伦理领域的发展。

Abstract: As emerging technologies continue to shape society, there is a growing
emphasis on the need to engage with design ethics as it unfolds in practice to
better capture the complexities of ethical considerations embedded in
day-to-day work. Positioned within the broader "turn to practice" in HCI, the
review characterizes this body of work in terms of its motivations, conceptual
frameworks, methodologies, and contributions across a range of design
disciplines and academic databases. The findings reveal a shift away from
static and abstract ethical frameworks toward an understanding of ethics as an
evolving, situated, and inherent aspect of design activities, one that can be
cultivated and fostered collaboratively. This review proposes six future
directions for establishing common research priorities and fostering the
field's growth. While the review promotes cross-disciplinary dialogue, we argue
that HCI research, given its cumulative experience with practice-oriented
research, is well-equipped to guide this emerging strand of work on design
ethics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MR工具在参数化建模中缺乏精确性和适合的输入方式，限制了设计师（尤其是非编程背景者）的使用。

Method: 通过语音输入、手势识别和多代理LLM系统，动态管理参数状态，解决模糊命令，并实现沉浸式环境中的实时模型操作。

Result: 该系统降低了早期设计任务的认知和操作障碍，支持用户通过自然交互方式探索设计空间。

Conclusion: 该工作将MR扩展为生成式设计平台，通过自然交互支持设计任务中的程序化思维。

Abstract: Mixed reality (MR) environments offer embodied spatial interaction, providing
intuitive 3D manipulation capabilities that enhance the conceptual design
process. Parametric modeling, a powerful and advanced architectural design
method, enables the generation of complex, optimized geometries. However, its
integration into MR environments remains limited due to precision constraints
and unsuitable input modalities. Existing MR tools prioritize spatial
interaction but lack the control and expressiveness required for parametric
workflows, particularly for designers without formal programming backgrounds.
We address this gap by introducing a novel conversational MR interface that
combines speech input, gesture recognition, and a multi-agent large language
model (LLM) system to support intuitive parametric modeling. Our system
dynamically manages parameter states, resolves ambiguous commands through
conversation and contextual prompting, and enables real-time model manipulation
within immersive environments. We demonstrate how this approach reduces
cognitive and operational barriers in early-stage design tasks, allowing users
to refine and explore their design space. This work expands the role of MR to a
generative design platform, supporting programmatic thinking in design tasks
through natural, embodied interaction.

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

TL;DR: sQRy技术将可运行程序嵌入QR码，但字符串占用空间限制了程序长度。本文提出一种减少字符串占用空间的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于sQRy技术中字符串占用大量空间，限制了可嵌入程序的长度，亟需一种减少字符串空间占用的方法。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的策略，减少字符串在sQRy中的占用空间。

Result: 该策略扩展了sQRy技术的适用性。

Conclusion: 通过减少字符串空间占用，sQRy技术的应用范围得以扩大。

Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to
include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user
even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different
practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics,
and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other
non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless
of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data.
However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of
strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by
strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.

TL;DR: WoundAIssist是一款AI驱动的移动应用，用于远程慢性伤口护理，通过患者拍照和问卷记录伤口，结合轻量级深度学习模型实现伤口分割和持续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口在老龄化人群中日益普遍，传统护理资源密集且效率低，亟需远程解决方案。

Method: 开发了WoundAIssist应用，集成轻量级深度学习模型，支持患者在家拍照和填写问卷，医生远程监控和视频咨询。

Result: 用户研究显示应用易用性好，AI伤口识别功能受好评，为患者和医生提供了高效工具。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了远程伤口护理的空白，其设计经验可为其他数字健康工具开发提供参考。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Motivation: 21世纪需求的复杂性要求培养复杂能力，但课堂学习与个性化评估之间存在差距，AI角色可能弥合这一差距。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，通过Likert量表和PLS-SEM分析56名高中生对AI角色的信任、社会存在感和有效性的感知。

Result: 学习者的信任影响其社会存在感，进而提升感知有效性；材料可信度和学习目标一致性是信任的关键因素。

Conclusion: AI角色在SBA中具有潜力，信任和社会存在感是其成功应用的关键。

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI普及，老年人因对新技术的保留态度需要定制化素养支持。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过聊天机器人Litti评估其对老年人AI素养（知识、安全、伦理）的影响。

Result: 定量数据显示AI素养有提升趋势但不显著；定性访谈揭示学习兴趣强烈但信任未增强。

Conclusion: 研究为老年人AI素养教育的设计提供了挑战与机遇的启示。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRL在适应下游任务时面临状态-动作-奖励数据的多模态性和任务多样性的挑战，需要一种更高效的架构来提升学习能力。

Method: T2MIR采用令牌级MoE捕获多模态语义，任务级MoE管理多样化任务，并通过对比学习优化任务路由。

Result: 实验表明T2MIR显著提升了上下文学习能力，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: T2MIR为ICRL提供了一种简单且可扩展的架构改进，推动了其在语言和视觉领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有计算方法仅适用于单一结合目标，限制了预测模型的适用性。MTPNet旨在通过多粒度蛋白语义条件动态优化分子表征。

Method: MTPNet包含宏观目标语义（MTS）和微观口袋语义（MPS）引导，通过条件深度学习统一预测活动悬崖。

Result: 在30个代表性数据集上，MTPNet平均RMSE提升18.95%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTPNet通过内部化交互模式，加速化合物优化与设计，代码已开源。

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期预测轻度认知障碍（MCI）转化存在即时性与准确性的权衡，MCI-Diff旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多任务序列重建策略训练共享去噪网络，并结合LLM驱动的“语言指南”确保临床合理性。

Result: 在ADNI和AIBL数据集上，MCI-Diff优于现有方法，早期转化预测准确率提高5-12%。

Conclusion: MCI-Diff成功平衡了即时性与准确性，为MCI转化预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PCDVQ的向量量化框架，通过解耦向量的方向和幅度进行独立量化，显著提升了边缘部署中大型语言模型的压缩效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在量化方向和幅度时耦合处理，但研究发现方向对量化更敏感，而欧氏距离作为相似性度量更关注幅度误差，导致量化误差增大。

Method: PCDVQ框架包含两个关键模块：1）极坐标解耦（PCD），将向量转换为极坐标并独立量化方向和幅度；2）分布对齐码本构建（DACC），优化码本以匹配源分布。

Result: 实验表明，PCDVQ在2-bit量化水平下比基线方法至少提高1.5%的零样本准确率。

Conclusion: PCDVQ为高精度和高压缩的大型语言模型提供了一种新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper是一种高效的GRPO训练算法，通过共享前缀计算减少冗余，提升长上下文学习场景下的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理长共享前缀时存在计算冗余问题，成为可扩展性的瓶颈。

Method: 提出Shared-Prefix Forward策略，将自注意力分为两部分，共享前缀仅编码一次，同时保持端到端训练的可微性和兼容性。

Result: 理论和实验证明Prefix Grouper与标准GRPO训练等效，计算成本显著降低，尤其在长前缀场景。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper可无缝集成现有GRPO架构，提升复杂任务和大模型的扩展性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now

Motivation: 在对抗攻击下，传统的共形预测（CP）方法无法保证鲁棒性，而现有的鲁棒CP方法在大规模场景中计算成本高或预测集过大。

Method: 利用Lipschitz约束网络（1-Lipschitz鲁棒网络）结合新方法lip-rcp，高效生成鲁棒CP集。

Result: lip-rcp在ImageNet等大规模场景中，预测集大小和计算效率均优于现有方法。同时，还分析了普通CP集在攻击下的最坏覆盖边界。

Conclusion: lip-rcp方法在保持高效的同时提供了鲁棒性保证，为对抗环境下的共形预测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

Result: 模型在两分类问题上精度达94.54%和95.83%，模型大小减少四倍，功耗316mW。

Conclusion: 方法有效实现了长寿命、低功耗的包装状态监测。

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出SocialDF数据集和基于LLM的多因素检测方法，用于识别社交媒体上的恶意深度伪造内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展带来了安全和信息真实性的挑战，现有检测方法难以区分良性和恶意伪造内容。

Method: 提出SocialDF数据集，结合面部识别、语音转录和多代理LLM管道，进行多模态验证。

Result: 通过语言、行为和上下文分析，有效区分合成媒体与真实内容。

Conclusion: SocialDF和LLM多因素检测方法为解决社交媒体深度伪造问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

TL;DR: UniPTMs是一个统一的多类型蛋白质翻译后修饰（PTM）预测框架，通过创新的双路径协作架构和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在跨模态特征融合、领域泛化和架构优化方面存在局限，需要一种统一框架来改进PTM预测。

Method: 提出UniPTMs框架，采用主从双路径协作架构，结合BGCA模块、LDFN网络、MACP金字塔和BHGFN网络，通过HDWF机制和对比损失优化特征融合。

Result: UniPTMs在五种修饰类型上性能显著提升（MCC提高3.2%-11.4%，AP提高4.2%-14.3%），并开发了轻量级变体UniPTMs-mini。

Conclusion: UniPTMs通过创新架构和多模态特征融合，超越了单类型预测范式，为PTM预测提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展现实（XR）系统需要处理多模态、多任务和隐私保护的需求，而现有的基础模型和联邦学习技术尚未完全适应这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一种模块化的FedFMs架构，包括模型训练和聚合的协调范式，并定义了影响FedFMs实现的SHIFT维度（传感器多样性、硬件异构性、交互性、任务可变性和时间性）。

Result: 通过分析XR应用中的SHIFT维度，提出了评估指标、数据集需求和设计权衡，为资源感知的FedFMs开发提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代XR系统中的上下文感知隐私保护智能奠定了技术和概念基础。

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

TL;DR: DoSAC是一种基于因果干预的强化学习算法，通过后门调整解决隐藏混杂因素问题，提升策略学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏混杂因素会影响状态和动作，导致策略学习偏差，传统RL算法忽视这一问题，仅依赖统计关联而非因果效应。

Method: 提出DoSAC算法，结合后门准则估计干预策略，无需真实混杂因素或因果标签，通过可学习的后门重构器推断伪过去变量。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，DoSAC在混杂环境下表现优于基线方法，具有更好的鲁棒性、泛化能力和策略可靠性。

Conclusion: DoSAC通过因果干预有效解决了隐藏混杂因素问题，为RL策略学习提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在训练早期会出现损失减速现象，模型规模扩大可以缓解这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解模型规模如何通过训练动态改善语言模型性能。

Method: 分析语言模型训练中的损失减速现象及其与零和学习（ZSL）的关系。

Result: 模型规模扩大能降低损失减速发生的损失值，并改善减速后的损失改进速率。

Conclusion: 损失减速和ZSL为语言模型规模定律提供了新视角，可能直接优化以改进模型性能。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

Motivation: 研究零阶优化方法在隐式正则化方面的特性，填补现有理论对解的具体性质描述的不足。

Method: 使用标准两点估计器进行零阶优化，分析其对Hessian矩阵迹小的解的偏好，并提供收敛速率理论证明。

Result: 零阶优化倾向于找到平坦极小值，实验在二分类任务和语言模型微调中验证了理论。

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法隐式偏好平坦极小值，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 解决在多启发式算法环境下，如何在线选择最优启发式算法的问题，特别是在无法直接估计启发式算法成本的情况下。

Method: 通过动态查询启发式算法并结合Bandit Learning技术，设计了一种算法来最小化遗憾。

Result: 提出了一个遗憾为$O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$的算法，并证明了其紧下界。

Conclusion: 该算法在多启发式算法环境下有效，且遗憾界限紧致。

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

Result: 去归一化方法简化了工作流程，加速了收敛，并提高了反演精度。

Conclusion: 去归一化是一种更优的初始模型嵌入方法，适用于神经网络参数化的FWI。

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI模型（如大语言模型）在高风险应用中需要可靠的不确定性量化方法，传统方法依赖于结构化输出，无法直接适用于仅查询设置。

Method: 提出了Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ)框架，基于统计中的缺失质量问题和Good Turing估计器，优化查询策略和预测集映射。

Result: 实验表明，CPQ能够生成比现有方法更信息丰富的预测集，适用于任何黑盒大语言模型。

Conclusion: CPQ为生成AI模型的不确定性量化提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

Conclusion: 对称性和物理约束的结合显著提升了PDE替代模型的精度和泛化能力，尤其在复杂流体动力学问题中。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Result: 在合成和图像生成任务中，流模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 大规模Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化是优化流模型训练的有效方法。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Conclusion: 通过引入新的表达性层次结构和旋转等变神经网络，论文为SGNNs的表达能力提供了更深入的理论基础和实用改进方法。

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究了预训练分布中任务多样性对上下文学习（ICL）能力的影响，发现任务多样性增加时，模型从仅适应预训练分布过渡到泛化至整个任务空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练分布中任务多样性对ICL能力的影响，以理解其泛化机制。

Method: 使用线性函数训练变换器，分析任务多样性增加时的ICL表现，并扩展到非线性回归问题。

Result: 任务多样性增加时，模型从适应预训练分布过渡到泛化至整个任务空间，并构建了相图描述这一现象。

Conclusion: 任务多样性是ICL泛化能力的关键因素，模型深度和问题维度也会影响这一过渡。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

Result: 分析显示新GPT版本发布后多样性突然且持续下降，验证了反馈循环的存在。

Conclusion: LLMs与人类的反馈循环可能导致信念固化，需警惕其对多样性和错误信念的影响。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Conclusion: EqCollide能够泛化到更多碰撞物体和更长时间范围，并对群作用变换的输入保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Method: 提出无需明确子群体结构的新算法，适应高维场景。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务中验证，新方法能可靠维持覆盖率和风险控制。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了子群体分布偏移下的保形预测问题。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large
and complex datasets. Our work enhances the efficiency and scalability of
TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality
reduction and data sampling.

Result: 在多种运动和操作任务中显著优于现有方法，提升了性能和超参数鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合贝尔曼最优算子的退火方法有效解决了连续动作空间中的学习效率和偏差问题。

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Conclusion: 本文为逆折叠模型的自由能基础提供了更清晰的理解，并展示了改进零-shot稳定性预测的潜力。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在时间序列预测中因输入信息密度低和复杂依赖关系而表现不佳，FaCTR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FaCTR结合低秩因子分解机和可学习门控机制，动态建模跨通道交互，并编码静态和动态协变量。

Result: 在11个公共基准测试中达到最优性能，参数规模仅为竞争模型的1/50，且支持自监督预训练。

Conclusion: FaCTR通过结构化设计实现了高效、可解释的时间序列预测，适合实际应用。

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image

### [269] [AutoQD: Automatic Discovery of Diverse Behaviors with Quality-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05634)
*Saeed Hedayatian,Stefanos Nikolaidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQD提出了一种自动生成行为描述符的方法，通过嵌入马尔可夫决策过程中的策略占用度量，替代传统手工设计的描述符，实现了无监督强化学习和QD优化中的多样性探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QD算法依赖手工设计的行为描述符，限制了多样性的探索范围。AutoQD旨在通过自动生成描述符，解决这一问题。

Method: 利用随机傅里叶特征近似策略占用度量之间的最大均值差异（MMD），生成反映行为差异的低维嵌入，作为QD算法的行为描述符。

Result: 实验证明，AutoQD能在连续控制任务中发现多样策略，无需预定义描述符，且嵌入距离随采样轨迹和维度增加收敛于真实MMD距离。

Conclusion: AutoQD为无监督强化学习和QD优化提供了新思路，支持开放学习和自动化行为发现，无需领域知识。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

Conclusion: 该方法在减少人工查询成本的同时，有效提升了预测效率，适用于需要结合专家意见的场景。

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种将大型Transformer参数映射到小型专用模型的方法，以降低计算成本并提高任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基础模型计算成本高且知识广泛，但特定任务可能只需部分知识，因此探索如何提取相关知识到小型模型。

Method: 通过任务特定的参数映射技术，将大型Transformer的知识压缩到小型专用模型中。

Result: 在图像建模任务中，生成的小型模型性能优于通用条件模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提取大型模型的相关知识，生成高性能的小型专用模型。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对生成模型数据归属的方法，通过学习参数重要性权重来改进归属准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在追踪梯度时通常忽略网络参数的不同层次信息，无法捕捉训练数据对不同语义方面的贡献。

Method: 学习参数重要性权重，无需标注数据，使归属过程适应模型结构。

Result: 在扩散模型中提高了归属准确性，并提供了对输出如何从训练数据中借鉴的细粒度见解。

Conclusion: 该方法改进了数据归属的准确性，并能捕捉训练数据对输出不同语义方面的贡献。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Hessian代理的量化位宽分配框架BAQ，通过凸优化任务自适应分配位宽，显著降低量化损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法依赖均匀或启发式位宽分配，未考虑权重对量化噪声的非均匀敏感性。

Method: 利用Hessian代理导出敏感性指标，将位宽分配问题转化为凸优化任务，提出BAQ算法。

Result: BAQ在125M至30B参数的LLMs上表现优于GPTQ，困惑度降低56倍。

Conclusion: BAQ通过理论分析和实验验证，实现了量化损失与复杂度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE), a flexible,
plug-and-play framework for diffusion inference-time density estimation and
control, based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions.
RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and
inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective,
stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles
therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility.
Experiments demonstrate that RNE achieves promising performances in diffusion
density estimation and inference-time control tasks, including annealing,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖显式提示导致计算开销，CGT旨在通过上下文编码减少这种开销并提升适应性。

Result: 在合成上下文学习任务和语言建模基准测试中表现优异，上下文编码更平滑一致。

Conclusion: CGT为高效、自适应的语言建模提供了新方向，通过架构直接整合上下文。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Result: DSD数据集显著提升了特定模型的性能，代码和训练模型已公开。

Conclusion: 数据质量是AI性能的关键，DSD为商业和多模态AI开发提供了新标准。

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Method: 结合显式差异矩阵（建模方向梯度）和隐式物理约束（确保消息传递符合自然规律）。

Result: 在真实世界的有向图数据（水通量网络和城市交通流网络）上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了GNN对高频信号的敏感性，能更准确地捕捉拓扑差异。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

Result: ManGO在合成任务、机器人控制、材料设计等多个领域显著优于24种单目标和10种多目标优化方法。

Conclusion: ManGO通过统一设计-分数空间，实现了更强的泛化能力，为复杂系统优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

Motivation: 现有监测方法多为手动、零星和被动，无法适应动态临床环境，且仅有9%的FDA注册AI医疗工具包含部署后监测计划。

Method: 提出将数据变化和模型性能下降作为统计假设检验问题，采用标签高效和统计有效的测试框架。

Result: 通过统计严谨性确保监测的科学性和可重复性，并为技术社区提供新的研究方向。

Conclusion: 部署后监测应基于统计原则，以支持临床AI系统的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法假设智能体能力静态，不符合现实动态能力变化场景，因此提出CL-DC问题。

Result: 实验表明AACL框架在跨动作空间策略泛化上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AACL框架有效解决了CL-DC问题，为动态能力变化下的持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

Motivation: 解决传统语义通信在低信噪比和分布不匹配情况下的性能问题，探索GAI在6G系统中的潜在应用。

Method: 基于随机微分方程（SDEs）建立理论框架，提出扩散参数优化和缩放机制，设计基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的语义收发器。

Result: 在低信噪比和分布偏移条件下显著优于传统基线，支持零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该框架为6G系统中GAI驱动的鲁棒语义传输提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大型基础模型时容易陷入局部最优，限制了模型泛化和下游操作（如适配器合并和剪枝）的效果。

Method: CoTo通过随机停用适配器，促进更平衡的优化和更广泛的损失空间探索，并结合理论分析和合作博弈方法量化适配器的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，CoTo显著提升了单任务性能、多任务合并准确性、剪枝鲁棒性，并减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: CoTo是一种高效且兼容性强的LoRA改进方法，适用于多种变体。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

Conclusion: 系统结合算法改进具有潜力，集成和多步方法的精心整合可以带来显著收益。

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

Result: 发现小规模正则化可诱导grokking；过参数化可实现无需显式正则化的grokking；ℓ₂范数在正则化时不可靠；数据选择能放大grokking。

Conclusion: 正则化和模型结构（如深度）是grokking的关键因素，ℓ₂范数不适合衡量泛化性能，数据选择是grokking的另一调控手段。

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进多标签分类（MLC）损失函数的方法，通过引入“任何类存在可能性”来应对负数据过多的问题，提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多标签分类中，负数据（未分配任何类的实例）过多会干扰学习过程，影响正实例的准确分类。现有方法将负数据单独分类会增加冗余和复杂性。

Method: 重新设计标准MLC损失函数，通过归一化加权几何平均预测类概率，计算“任何类存在可能性”，并引入正则化参数控制负类概率的贡献。

Result: 在多个大规模数据集上测试，新损失函数显著提升了分类性能，F1、F2和平均精度分别提高了6.01、8.06和3.11个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了负数据过多的问题，提升了多标签分类性能，且无需额外参数或计算复杂度。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSFA的新框架，用于解决开放环境数据流中的概念漂移问题，通过原型校准和无源适应算法实现稳定学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据流的非平稳性和概念漂移对自适应学习系统提出了挑战，现有方法忽视了标签空间与分布的协同演化。

Method: CSFA结合了训练无关的原型校准机制和基于可靠替代间隙的锐度感知最小化算法，实现动态适应。

Result: 实验证明CSFA在开放世界流式场景中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSFA为开放环境下的语义和分布演化提供了统一的稳定适应框架。

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Rudransh Agnihotri,Ananya Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低成本、高效的替代方案，通过冻结的7B LLM、单行JSON规则和rank-16 LoRA适配器，取代传统昂贵的奖励模型训练，在RewardBench上达到96.2%的准确率，并显著提升在线RLHF性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RLHF流程中奖励模型训练成本高昂，需要数十亿参数和离线调优阶段，亟需一种更高效、低成本的替代方案。

Method: 使用冻结的7B指令调优LLM，仅添加单行JSON规则和rank-16 LoRA适配器（影响0.8%参数），替代传统奖励模型。

Result: 在RewardBench上达到96.2%准确率，超越27B-70B参数的专用奖励网络；7B模型在GSM-8K上以92%准确率超越70B DPO基线。

Conclusion: 结合提示工程和小型LoRA，实现了低成本、透明且易调整的奖励函数，无需离线阶段即可达到SOTA效果。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于LSTM的新框架，结合时空特征SPH，显著提升了COVID-19住院预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行凸显了准确预测住院需求的重要性，但现有模型在变异株激增时表现不佳。

Method: 采用LSTM框架，引入时空特征SPH，并结合多时间范围集成策略。

Result: 模型在Delta和Omicron激增期间优于基准模型，预测误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 研究不仅改进了住院预测，还展示了时空特征在传染病建模中的重要性。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最优执行策略（如静态Almgren-Chriss模型）在动态市场中表现不佳，需要一种更灵活的方法来平衡市场冲击成本和时机风险。

Method: flowOE通过模仿多样化的专家策略，并结合改进的损失函数，动态选择最适合当前市场条件的行为。

Result: 实验表明，flowOE在多种市场条件下显著优于传统基准和专家模型，实现了更高的利润和更低的风险。

Conclusion: flowOE展示了其在动态最优执行问题中的实际应用潜力，为金融市场提供了更高效的执行策略。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

TL;DR: BiTrajDiff提出了一种双向轨迹扩散框架，通过同时生成历史和未来轨迹来增强离线强化学习的数据多样性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中静态数据集存在分布偏差，传统数据增强方法仅关注未来轨迹生成，忽略了历史轨迹的探索，限制了行为模式的多样性。

Method: BiTrajDiff将轨迹生成任务分解为两个独立的扩散过程：前向预测未来动态和后向追溯历史过渡，利用关键状态作为锚点扩展状态空间。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，BiTrajDiff表现优于其他先进数据增强方法。

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff通过双向轨迹生成有效提升了离线强化学习的数据多样性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证在限价订单簿（LOB）数据中，增加神经网络复杂性是否真正提升短期价格预测能力，还是主要依赖数据预处理。

Method: 方法包括从逻辑回归、XGBoost到深度架构（如DeepLOB、Conv1D+LSTM）的模型比较，并引入两种数据过滤管道（Kalman、Savitzky Golay）和二元/三元标签方案。

Result: 结果显示，经过数据预处理和超参数调优后，简单模型性能可匹配甚至超越复杂网络，且推理更快、可解释性更强。

Conclusion: 结论表明，数据预处理和特征工程比模型复杂性对预测性能的影响更大，简单模型在实际应用中更具优势。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟筛选方法依赖已知配体结合口袋的holo结构，但在apo或预测结构（如AlphaFold2生成）上性能下降。

Method: 采用三模态对比学习模块对齐配体、holo口袋和检测到的空腔表示，并通过跨注意力适配器动态聚合候选结合位点。

Result: 在apo结构基准测试中，EF1%从11.75提升至37.19，同时在holo结构上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏实验解析的蛋白质-配体复合物场景下具有潜力，推动首创药物发现。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Conclusion: 论文为神经网络解释的评估提供了统一框架和可靠指标，推动了机制可解释性的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

Method: 提出SPDO方法，放宽子问题精度要求并利用平均功能相似性，优化通信和计算复杂度。

Result: SPDO在通信和计算复杂度上达到最优，实验显示其显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPDO是一种高效的去中心化优化方法，适用于功能相似性高的场景。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to
ongoing research in machine learning and data science.

Conclusion: ONC现象为序数回归任务提供了新的理论支持，并展示了固定阈值的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Conclusion: PiPE比单独使用位置编码或持久同调更具表达力，推动了图表示学习的发展。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable

TL;DR: WDAN提出了一种基于小波变换的解耦自适应归一化方法，用于处理非平稳时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非平稳时间序列的统计特性随时间变化，导致深度学习模型泛化能力差，现有方法忽略了时间序列的多组分特性。

Method: 使用离散小波变换将输入分解为低频趋势和高频波动，对每部分应用定制归一化策略，对强非平稳趋势部分采用一阶差分提取稳定特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，WDAN显著提高了不同主干模型的预测准确性。

Conclusion: WDAN是一种模型无关的框架，能有效处理时间序列的非平稳性，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Conclusion: 该方法为梯度训练提供了有竞争力的替代方案，具有更好的并行性和对不可微操作的支持。

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Motivation: 传统NILM方法依赖粗粒度数据和静态客户信息，而现有深度学习方法因数据分布漂移导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出NILMFormer，结合子序列平稳化/去平稳化方案和基于时间戳的位置编码，以应对数据分布漂移。

Result: 在4个真实数据集上，NILMFormer显著优于现有方法，并已成功部署于EDF的能源监测服务。

Conclusion: NILMFormer通过创新设计解决了NILM中的数据分布漂移问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Conclusion: CamAL为智能电网管理提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

Conclusion: 该框架有效统一了离散决策和连续动力学，提升了跟车行为建模的准确性。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Conclusion: DeviceScope为智能电表数据分析提供了实用工具，解决了数据理解和标注稀缺问题。

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Conclusion: 该方法可减轻大规模交通分配问题的计算负担。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在高风险应用中需要可靠性，但现有方法（如EDL）对对抗性和分布外输入过于自信。

Method: C-EDL通过生成多样化的任务保留变换，量化表示分歧，调整预测以校准不确定性。

Conclusion: C-EDL是一种高效且轻量的方法，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和不确定性估计能力。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 研究为零售环境中的模型选择提供了实践指导，强调了数据预处理对提升预测性能的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,

the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在满足领域特定约束的同时最大化预期回报的序列决策问题。

Method: 提出C-PG算法，支持基于动作或参数的探索策略，并在特定噪声模型下证明其收敛性。

Result: C-PG在约束控制任务中表现优异，特别是在训练后部署确定性策略时。

Conclusion: C-PG及其变体在约束强化学习中具有高效性和收敛性优势。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

TL;DR: PrunE是一种基于剪枝的图OOD方法，通过去除虚假边提升OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在训练和测试数据分布偏移时性能下降，现有方法直接识别不变子图存在挑战。

Method: PrunE通过两种正则化项剪枝虚假边：图大小约束和概率对齐。

Result: 实验表明PrunE显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PrunE能更全面地保留不变子图，提升OOD泛化性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的大规模应用受限于高硬件资源需求，现有量化方法主要集中于均匀标量量化，而向量量化在大型语言模型中已取得成功。

Method: 采用基于码本的加性向量量化方法对扩散模型进行压缩，并在低比特量化下测试性能。

Result: 在LDM-4基准测试中，W4A8量化下sFID比全精度模型低1.92分，W2A8量化下FID、sFID和ISC表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在低比特量化下显著提升了扩散模型的性能，并通过高效推理内核实现了硬件无关的FLOPs节省。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Conclusion: 该研究为定义和解决图的长距离问题提供了理论工具，有助于新数据集和架构的评估。

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AMPED通过显式协调探索和多样性，实现了鲁棒且通用的技能学习。

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在非结构化数据上表现优异，但树模型在结构化数据上仍占优。现有CAM加速方案存在内存消耗大和利用率低的问题。

Result: 实验显示，RETENTION框架在空间效率上提升4.35×至207.12×，精度损失小于3%。

Conclusion: RETENTION为树模型加速提供了高效资源利用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

Method: 将固体分区编码为令牌序列，设计两阶段Transformer模块预测变形。

Result: LaDEEP比有限元方法快五个数量级，精度相当，且优于其他深度学习基线20.47%。

Conclusion: LaDEEP在实际工业系统中表现出色，验证了其高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 成员推断测试在放宽定义后仍不可靠，需进一步研究其安全性。

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models

These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with

Conclusion: 显式建模更适合多固体系统，能避免信息混淆并提升性能。

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is
avaiable at \href{this link}{https://github.com/therontau0054/Unisoma}.

Result: 在四个TR基准测试中，Table-r1优于所有基于SLM的方法，准确率比基础模型（LLaMA-8B）提升至少15%，性能接近LLMs。

Conclusion: Table-r1显著提升了SLMs在表格推理任务中的表现，证明了其在布局泛化和推理一致性上的有效性。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

*Haripriya Harikumar,Santu Rana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的测试时优化方法，通过减少分类器权重噪声，提升预测置信度的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性估计方法（如dropout）难以清晰区分可靠与不可靠预测，主要因分类器权重噪声干扰细粒度统计信息。

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，考虑噪声影响以生成更可靠的置信度估计，并通过单调子集选择函数验证其性能。

Result: 方法在AUSE和AURC等风险指标中表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布差异，区分分布内外样本，并揭示CNN与ViT分类器的关键差异。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了预测置信度的可靠性，并在多个视觉数据集中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的系统感知遗忘定义，针对仅能访问系统存储数据的攻击者，开发了高效的线性分类遗忘算法，并分析了其性能权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 现有遗忘定义过于严格，导致算法开发困难且不切实际。通过放松攻击者能力假设，提出更实用的系统感知遗忘定义。

Method: 采用选择性采样方法，开发了精确的系统感知遗忘算法，适用于线性分类和一般函数分类。

Result: 理论分析了删除容量、准确性、内存和计算时间之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 系统感知遗忘定义更实用，算法高效且适用于多种分类场景。

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型因其固定的从左到右标记生成方式而累积错误，需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出RPT方法，通过迭代重访和替换先前生成的文本窗口中的标记，同时保留模型的预测质量和速度。

Result: 在8B参数模型上仅用100B数据进行微调后，RPT在推理和编码基准测试中实现了约10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效的采样方法，能够显著减少错误累积并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

Result: 实验显示，STOF在MHA计算和端到端推理中分别实现1.7倍和1.5倍加速。

Conclusion: STOF有效解决了稀疏Transformer的性能优化问题，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

Result: T2L生成的LoRA在多个任务上表现与任务特定适配器相当，并能零样本泛化到新任务。

Conclusion: T2L为快速、低成本适应基础模型提供了新途径，推动了模型的民主化应用。

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

Conclusion: IAM为机器遗忘提供了高效评估工具，揭示了近似遗忘算法中的过遗忘和欠遗忘风险，需加强保护措施。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at
https://github.com/Happy2Git/Unlearning_Inference_IAM.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering
performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure
meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted
$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and
extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing
alternatives.

Result: 在电路和电网数据集上，流注意力显著提升了图分类和回归任务的性能。

Conclusion: 流注意力机制能有效捕捉流图数据的守恒特性，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Result: 实验证明SAM-GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中有效优化了学习过程。

Conclusion: 梯度幅度相似性在MTDL中对梯度聚合的规范化至关重要，SAM-GS为梯度冲突提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Conclusion: carps框架为HPO评估的标准化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

Conclusion: ENMA提供了一个鲁棒且适应性强的框架，适用于建模复杂时空动态。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

Motivation: 解决单相流动系统在瞬态条件下的建模与控制挑战，尤其是基于PDE的复杂问题。

Result: 数值实验验证了PINC模型能准确表征流动动力学并支持实时控制，无需迭代求解器。

Conclusion: PINC框架为流体流动监测与优化提供了高效且无需标记数据的替代方案。

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

TL;DR: ICU-TSB是一个基于ICU电子健康记录（EHR）的基准测试，用于评估通过时间表示学习进行患者分层的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进诊断和治疗策略，患者分层对个性化医疗至关重要。ICU的EHR数据提供了丰富的时间临床数据。

Method: 提出ICU-TSB基准，采用层次化评估框架，比较统计方法和循环神经网络（如LSTM和GRU）在患者表示学习中的表现。

Result: 时间表示学习能重新发现临床有意义的患者群体，但任务仍具挑战性（v-measure在0.40-0.46之间）。

Conclusion: ICU-TSB为患者分层提供了可重复的评估工具，并探索了为聚类分配可解释标签的策略。

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Motivation: 风场中风机间的尾流效应会显著降低整体能量产出，现有方法难以应对动态风况或大规模风场。

Result: 在低精度稳态模拟中，模型训练步数减少10倍，能量产出提升14%，且性能更稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法是首个能在动态风况下通用的深度强化学习尾流控制方案，具有显著的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法依赖手动设计的增强策略，未考虑数据生成分布，且忽略同一模型生成的图之间的相似性。MGCL旨在通过生成模型改进对比学习。

Method: MGCL首先估计观测数据的graphon，定义基于graphon的数据增强策略，并在图级任务中对数据集聚类，每组估计一个graphon以生成对比对。

Result: 在基准数据集上，MGCL实现了最先进的性能，验证了生成模型在图对比学习中的优势。

Conclusion: MGCL通过结合生成模型，提供了一种数据自适应且理论支持的图对比学习方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Conclusion: SPEC为嵌入模型的可解释比较和对齐提供了高效工具。

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 将EP算法扩展到时变输入，解决其变分描述和边界条件的挑战。

Method: 提出GLEP，扩展EP的变分框架，分析不同边界条件下的学习算法。

Result: HEL是GLEP的特殊案例，满足硬件实现的需求，具有高效性和局部学习能力。

Conclusion: GLEP为时变输入提供了理论框架，HEL是其实用化的成功案例。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

Motivation: 现有遗忘方法易被微调恢复，输出微调不足以实现鲁棒遗忘。

Method: 提出UNDO方法，通过蒸馏未学习模型到部分噪声副本中，实现鲁棒遗忘。

Result: UNDO在合成任务中匹配从头训练的鲁棒性，计算成本降低20-40%，仅需0.01%标注数据。在WMDP基准上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 蒸馏结合遗忘步骤为鲁棒能力移除提供便捷路径。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: AOMEA为复杂环境中的MAS设计提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

Method: 采用集中式Transformer方法，整合所有受控智能体的历史观察和动作，以应对部分可观测环境中多样且未知的队友。

Result: 在StarCraft II任务中，MAT-NAHT在样本效率和泛化能力上优于POAM，且无需额外的智能体建模目标。

Conclusion: MAT-NAHT通过Transformer有效解决了NAHT问题，展现了集中式方法的优势。

Abstract: N-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT) is a newly introduced challenge in multi-agent
reinforcement learning, where controlled subteams of varying sizes must
dynamically collaborate with varying numbers and types of unknown teammates
without pre-coordination. The existing learning algorithm (POAM) considers only
independent learning for its flexibility in dealing with a changing number of
agents. However, independent learning fails to fully capture the inter-agent
dynamics essential for effective collaboration. Based on our observation that
transformers deal effectively with sequences with varying lengths and have been
shown to be highly effective for a variety of machine learning problems, this
work introduces a centralized, transformer-based method for N-agent ad hoc
teamwork. Our proposed approach incorporates historical observations and
actions of all controlled agents, enabling optimal responses to diverse and
unseen teammates in partially observable environments. Empirical evaluation on
a StarCraft II task demonstrates that MAT-NAHT outperforms POAM, achieving
superior sample efficiency and generalization, without auxiliary agent-modeling
objectives.

Conclusion: 生成式AI可作为CRSD研究的有效补充工具，尤其在复杂社会困境（如Port of Mars）中具有潜力。

Abstract: Collective risk social dilemmas (CRSD) highlight a trade-off between
individual preferences and the need for all to contribute toward achieving a
group objective. Problems such as climate change are in this category, and so
it is critical to understand their social underpinnings. However, rigorous CRSD
methodology often demands large-scale human experiments but it is difficult to
guarantee sufficient power and heterogeneity over socio-demographic factors.
Generative AI offers a potential complementary approach to address thisproblem.
By replacing human participants with large language models (LLM), it allows for
a scalable empirical framework. This paper focuses on the validity of this
approach and whether it is feasible to represent a large-scale human-like
experiment with sufficient diversity using LLM. In particular, where previous
literature has focused on political surveys, virtual towns and classical
game-theoretic examples, we focus on a complex CRSD used in the institutional
economics and sustainability literature known as Port of Mars

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are useful for simulating

supported by laboratory experiments with real human participants. In this work
we demonstrate how multi-agent reinforcement learning can model group behavior
in a spatially and temporally complex public good provision game called Clean
Up. We show that human groups succeed in Clean Up when they can see who is who
and track reputations over time but fail under conditions of anonymity. A new
multi-agent reinforcement learning model of reputation-based cooperation
demonstrates the same difference between identifiable and anonymous conditions.
Furthermore, both human groups and artificial agent groups solve the problem
via turn-taking despite other options being available. Our results highlight
the benefits of using multi-agent reinforcement learning to model human social

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic

ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread

these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used
FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of
audio-video DeepFake detection.

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体视频在多个领域有广泛应用，但缺乏公开的完整数据集。

Method: 使用iPhone Pro和Apple Vision Pro（AVP）设备捕获视频，构建SVD数据集。

Result: 发布了包含300个短视频和10个长视频的公开数据集。

Conclusion: SVD数据集将促进立体视频相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Stereoscopic video has long been the subject of research due to its capacity
to deliver immersive three-dimensional content across a wide range of
applications, from virtual and augmented reality to advanced human-computer
interaction. The dual-view format inherently provides binocular disparity cues
that enhance depth perception and realism, making it indispensable for fields
such as telepresence, 3D mapping, and robotic vision. Until recently, however,
end-to-end pipelines for capturing, encoding, and viewing high-quality 3D video
were neither widely accessible nor optimized for consumer-grade devices.
Today's smartphones, such as the iPhone Pro, and modern Head-Mounted Displays
(HMDs), like the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), offer built-in support for
stereoscopic video capture, hardware-accelerated encoding, and seamless
playback on devices like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3, requiring
minimal user intervention. Apple refers to this streamlined workflow as spatial
video. Making the full stereoscopic video process available to everyone has
made new applications possible. Despite these advances, there remains a notable
absence of publicly available datasets that include the complete spatial video
pipeline.
  In this paper, we introduce SVD, a spatial video dataset comprising 300
five-second video sequences, 150 captured using an iPhone Pro and 150 with an
AVP. Additionally, 10 longer videos with a minimum duration of 2 minutes have
been recorded. The SVD dataset is publicly released under an open-access
license to facilitate research in codec performance evaluation, subjective and
objective quality of experience (QoE) assessment, depth-based computer vision,
stereoscopic video streaming, and other emerging 3D applications such as neural
rendering and volumetric capture. Link to the dataset:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，结合动态奖励调整和课程学习，用于轮腿机器人从跌倒中自适应恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预规划动作或简化动力学，难以实现鲁棒的恢复策略。

Method: 采用非对称的actor-critic架构和噪声注入观测，动态平衡多样化恢复动作的探索与精确姿态调整。

Result: 轮腿协同减少了15.8%和26.2%的关节扭矩消耗，并在两种四足平台上实现了99.1%和97.8%的恢复成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法无需平台特定调整，显著提升了轮腿机器人的恢复能力。

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

Motivation: 现有TOG数据集多为合成或注释不完整，限制了模型性能。缺乏真实世界数据集和适应新对象的解决方案。

Method: 引入TD-TOG数据集，包含真实场景的RGB-D数据和多类别标注；提出Binary-TOG框架，结合零样本和一样本学习。

Result: Binary-TOG在多对象场景中平均抓取准确率为68.9%。

Conclusion: TD-TOG和Binary-TOG为TOG研究提供了新工具，零样本和一样本学习在对象泛化中表现良好。

Abstract: Task-oriented grasping (TOG) is an essential preliminary step for robotic
task execution, which involves predicting grasps on regions of target objects
that facilitate intended tasks. Existing literature reveals there is a limited
availability of TOG datasets for training and benchmarking despite large
demand, which are often synthetic or have artifacts in mask annotations that
hinder model performance. Moreover, TOG solutions often require affordance
masks, grasps, and object masks for training, however, existing datasets
typically provide only a subset of these annotations. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Top-down Task-oriented Grasping (TD-TOG) dataset,
designed to train and evaluate TOG solutions. TD-TOG comprises 1,449 real-world
RGB-D scenes including 30 object categories and 120 subcategories, with
hand-annotated object masks, affordances, and planar rectangular grasps. It
also features a test set for a novel challenge that assesses a TOG solution's
ability to distinguish between object subcategories. To contribute to the
demand for TOG solutions that can adapt and manipulate previously unseen
objects without re-training, we propose a novel TOG framework, Binary-TOG.
Binary-TOG uses zero-shot for object recognition, and one-shot learning for
affordance recognition. Zero-shot learning enables Binary-TOG to identify
objects in multi-object scenes through textual prompts, eliminating the need
for visual references. In multi-object settings, Binary-TOG achieves an average
task-oriented grasp accuracy of 68.9%. Lastly, this paper contributes a
comparative analysis between one-shot and zero-shot learning for object
generalization in TOG to be used in the development of future TOG solutions.

Abstract: Traditional soil sampling and analysis methods are labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and limited in spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for
large-scale precision agriculture. To address these limitations, we present a
robotic solution for real-time sampling, analysis and mapping of key soil
properties. Our system consists of two main sub-systems: a Sample Acquisition
System (SAS) for precise, automated in-field soil sampling; and a Sample
Analysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's
performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale
Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently
acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can
process each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and
macronutrients. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to
provide farmers with timely, data-driven insights for more efficient and
sustainable soil management and fertilizer application.

Abstract: Apples are among the most widely consumed fruits worldwide. Currently, apple
harvesting fully relies on manual labor, which is costly, drudging, and
hazardous to workers. Hence, robotic harvesting has attracted increasing
attention in recent years. However, existing systems still fall short in terms
of performance, effectiveness, and reliability for complex orchard
environments. In this work, we present the development and evaluation of a
dual-arm harvesting robot. The system integrates a ToF camera, two 4DOF robotic
arms, a centralized vacuum system, and a post-harvest handling module. During
harvesting, suction force is dynamically assigned to either arm via the vacuum
system, enabling efficient apple detachment while reducing power consumption
and noise. Compared to our previous design, we incorporated a platform movement
mechanism that enables both in-out and up-down adjustments, enhancing the
robot's dexterity and adaptability to varying canopy structures. On the
algorithmic side, we developed a robust apple localization pipeline that
combines a foundation-model-based detector, segmentation, and clustering-based
depth estimation, which improves performance in orchards. Additionally,
pressure sensors were integrated into the system, and a novel dual-arm
coordination strategy was introduced to respond to harvest failures based on
sensor feedback, further improving picking efficiency. Field demos were
conducted in two commercial orchards in MI, USA, with different canopy
structures. The system achieved success rates of 0.807 and 0.797, with an
average picking cycle time of 5.97s. The proposed strategy reduced harvest time
by 28% compared to a single-arm baseline. The dual-arm harvesting robot
enhances the reliability and efficiency of apple picking. With further
advancements, the system holds strong potential for autonomous operation and
commercialization for the apple industry.

Abstract: In post-disaster scenarios, rapid and efficient delivery of medical resources
is critical and challenging due to severe damage to infrastructure. To provide
an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and
task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA)
for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an
informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free
trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path
efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
(CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster
environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the
overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional
strategies, showing substantial reductions in total mission completion time and
traveled distance. Additionally, the cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs
effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system' s
scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 传统软体机器人在弯曲角度控制上存在精度不足和响应速度慢的问题，需要改进以实现更精确的运动控制。

Method: 通过将SMA线嵌入硅胶基质的应变限制层中，并采用闭环控制算法和摄像头测量垂直平面的角度变化。

Conclusion: SMA线的引入显著提升了软体机器人的弯曲控制精度和效率，为未来软体机器人设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by
incorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the
desired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending
module with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The
SMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new
strain-limiting layer. A simple closed-loop control algorithm was used to
regulate the bending angle of the soft robot within its workspace. A camera was
utilized to measure the angular changes in the vertical plane. Different
angles, ranging from 0 to 65 degrees, were covered to evaluate the performance
of the module and the bending angle control algorithm. The experimental tests
demonstrate that using the SMA wire results in more precise control of bending
in the vertical plane. In addition, it is possible to bend more with less
working pressure. The error range was reduced from an average of 5 degrees to 2
degrees, and the rise time was reduced from an average of 19 seconds to 3
seconds.

Conclusion: 演示设备的设计对模仿学习效果有显著影响，自然人类行为数据更有效。

Abstract: Imitation learning for acquiring generalizable policies often requires a
large volume of demonstration data, making the process significantly costly.
One promising strategy to address this challenge is to leverage the cognitive
and decision-making skills of human demonstrators with strong generalization
capability, particularly by extracting task-relevant cues from their gaze
behavior. However, imitation learning typically involves humans collecting data
using demonstration devices that emulate a robot's embodiment and visual
condition. This raises the question of how such devices influence gaze
behavior. We propose an experimental framework that systematically analyzes
demonstrators' gaze behavior across a spectrum of demonstration devices. Our
experimental results indicate that devices emulating (1) a robot's embodiment
or (2) visual condition impair demonstrators' capability to extract
task-relevant cues via gaze behavior, with the extent of impairment depending
on the degree of emulation. Additionally, gaze data collected using devices
that capture natural human behavior improves the policy's task success rate
from 18.8% to 68.8% under environmental shifts.

Abstract: We study the problem of peeling a Velcro strap from a surface using a robotic
manipulator. The surface geometry is arbitrary and unknown. The robot has
access to only the force feedback and its end-effector position. This problem
is challenging due to the partial observability of the environment and the
incompleteness of the sensor feedback. To solve it, we first model the system
with simple analytic state and action models based on quasi-static dynamics
assumptions. We then study the fully-observable case where the state of both
the Velcro and the robot are given. For this case, we obtain the optimal
solution in closed-form which minimizes the total energy cost. Next, for the
partially-observable case, we design a state estimator which estimates the
underlying state using only force and position feedback. Then, we present a
heuristics-based controller that balances exploratory and exploitative
behaviors in order to peel the velcro efficiently. Finally, we evaluate our
proposed method in environments with complex geometric uncertainties and sensor
noises, achieving 100% success rate with less than 80% increase in energy cost
compared to the optimal solution when the environment is fully-observable,
outperforming the baselines by a large margin.

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了零样本物体导航的成功率和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robot navigation, especially with end-to-end learning
approaches like reinforcement learning (RL), have shown remarkable efficiency
and effectiveness. Yet, successful navigation still relies on two key
capabilities: mapping and planning, whether explicit or implicit. Classical
approaches use explicit mapping pipelines to register ego-centric observations
into a coherent map frame for the planner. In contrast, end-to-end learning
achieves this implicitly, often through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that
fuse current and past observations into a latent space for planning. While
architectures such as LSTM and GRU capture temporal dependencies, our findings
reveal a key limitation: their inability to perform effective spatial
memorization. This skill is essential for transforming and integrating
sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial
representations that support downstream planning. To address this, we propose
Spatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs), a simple yet effective modification
to existing RNNs, designed to enhance spatial memorization capabilities. We
introduce an attention-based architecture with SRUs, enabling long-range
navigation using a single forward-facing stereo camera. Regularization
techniques are employed to ensure robust end-to-end recurrent training via RL.
Experimental results show our approach improves long-range navigation by 23.5%
compared to existing RNNs. Furthermore, with SRU memory, our method outperforms
the RL baseline with explicit mapping and memory modules, achieving a 29.6%
improvement in diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and
memorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale
pretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer to diverse and
complex real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is
essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of
infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising
solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature
monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban
environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance,
coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we
propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO)
algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal
screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex
optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing
trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum
screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency
compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides
critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient
multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader

Abstract: Efficient Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is necessary for autonomous robotic
lawnmowers to effectively navigate and maintain lawns with diverse and
irregular shapes. This paper introduces a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for
CPP, designed to convert user-defined boundaries on an aerial map into
optimized coverage paths seamlessly. The pipeline includes user input
extraction, coordinate transformation, area decomposition and path generation
using our novel AdaptiveDecompositionCPP algorithm, preview and customization
through an interactive coverage path visualizer, and conversion to actionable
GPS waypoints. The AdaptiveDecompositionCPP algorithm combines cellular
decomposition with an adaptive merging strategy to reduce non-mowing travel
thereby enhancing operational efficiency. Experimental evaluations,
encompassing both simulations and real-world lawnmower tests, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the framework in coverage completeness and mowing efficiency.

TL;DR: BEAST是一种新型动作分词器，利用B样条将动作序列编码为紧凑的离散或连续标记，无需单独训练分词器，支持并行解码生成平滑轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作分词器（如向量量化或字节对编码）需要单独训练且生成的标记长度不一致，BEAST旨在解决这些问题，提供高效且平滑的动作序列生成。

Method: BEAST通过B样条编码动作序列，支持连续或离散标记，并与三种模型架构（VAE、Transformer、Florence-2）集成验证其兼容性。

Result: 在166个模拟任务和8个真实任务中，BEAST显著降低计算成本，生成平滑的高频控制信号，且任务成功率与先进方法相当。

Conclusion: BEAST是一种高效、兼容性强且性能优越的动作分词器，适用于连续控制任务。

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Gergely Bari,Laszlo Palkovics*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究利用深度强化学习（DRL）开发了一种高性能控制器，用于在轮胎抓地力极限下控制四轮驱动电动赛车。通过PPO算法训练，该控制器直接映射车辆状态到转向和扭矩指令，动态优化扭矩分配，性能媲美甚至超越传统物理模型控制器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车辆动力学控制（VDC）方法依赖复杂物理模型，难以在极限条件下实现高性能控制。本研究探索DRL作为一种替代方案，以开发更灵活、自适应的控制系统。

Method: 使用近端策略优化（PPO）算法训练强化学习代理，直接根据车辆状态（如速度、加速度和横摆率）生成转向和独立四轮扭矩指令，绕过传统踏板输入和扭矩分配算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，RL代理学会了动态优化扭矩分配的策略，提升了车辆操控性并减少了固有转向不足，性能与传统控制器相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: DRL在复杂车辆动力学控制中展现出潜力，为自动驾驶在高要求场景（如赛车和道路安全）提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling autonomous vehicles at their handling limits is a significant
challenge, particularly for electric vehicles with active four wheel drive
(A4WD) systems offering independent wheel torque control. While traditional
Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) methods use complex physics-based models, this
study explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop a unified,
high-performance controller. We employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm to train an agent for optimal lap times in a simulated racecar
(TORCS) at the tire grip limit. Critically, the agent learns an end-to-end
policy that directly maps vehicle states, like velocities, accelerations, and
yaw rate, to a steering angle command and independent torque commands for each
of the four wheels. This formulation bypasses conventional pedal inputs and
explicit torque vectoring algorithms, allowing the agent to implicitly learn
the A4WD control logic needed for maximizing performance and stability.
Simulation results demonstrate the RL agent learns sophisticated strategies,
dynamically optimizing wheel torque distribution corner-by-corner to enhance
handling and mitigate the vehicle's inherent understeer. The learned behaviors
mimic and, in aspects of grip utilization, potentially surpass traditional
physics-based A4WD controllers while achieving competitive lap times. This
research underscores DRL's potential to create adaptive control systems for
complex vehicle dynamics, suggesting RL is a potent alternative for advancing
autonomous driving in demanding, grip-limited scenarios for racing and road
safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在复杂环境中需要快速适应动态变化，但现有方法在重规划、协作、任务时长建模和实际部署方面存在不足。

Method: 定义了新的协同任务重规划问题，并开发了一种基于图注意力网络和注意力模型的编码器/解码器模型。

Result: 在无人机协同任务中，新方法在90%的情况下性能接近最优解，且运行速度比现有方法快85-370倍。

Conclusion: 该研究为多智能体系统的鲁棒性提供了新思路，推动了自主系统的实际应用。

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how spatially grounded auxiliary representations
can provide both broad, high-level grounding as well as direct, actionable
information to improve policy learning performance and generalization for
dexterous tasks. We study these mid-level representations across three critical
dimensions: object-centricity, pose-awareness, and depth-awareness. We use
these interpretable mid-level representations to train specialist encoders via
supervised learning, then feed them as inputs to a diffusion policy to solve
dexterous bimanual manipulation tasks in the real world. We propose a novel
mixture-of-experts policy architecture that combines multiple specialized
expert models, each trained on a distinct mid-level representation, to improve
policy generalization. This method achieves an average success rate that is 11%
higher than a language-grounded baseline and 24 percent higher than a standard
diffusion policy baseline on our evaluation tasks. Furthermore, we find that
leveraging mid-level representations as supervision signals for policy actions
within a weighted imitation learning algorithm improves the precision with
which the policy follows these representations, yielding an additional
performance increase of 10%. Our findings highlight the importance of grounding
robot policies not only with broad perceptual tasks but also with more
granular, actionable representations. For further information and videos,

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于3D光流的世界模型，用于指导机器人操作任务，通过合成大规模数据集ManiFlow-110k，并结合语言指令生成3D光流轨迹，实现了跨硬件泛化的机器人操作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人操作数据集缺乏统一性和多样性，阻碍了机器人学习通用的动作表示。人类通过理解物体在3D空间中的运动来指导操作，这一线索与具体硬件无关，适用于不同机器人。

Method: 合成大规模3D光流数据集ManiFlow-110k，通过视频扩散模型学习操作物理规律，生成基于语言指令的3D光流轨迹，并利用GPT-4o评估预测结果，最终通过优化策略生成机器人动作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化机器人操作任务中表现出强泛化能力，且无需硬件特定训练即可实现跨硬件适配。

Conclusion: 基于3D光流的世界模型为机器人操作提供了统一的动作表示，实现了跨硬件泛化的操作能力。

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

Conclusion: Astra的双模型架构显著提升了机器人在复杂环境中的导航能力。

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for
generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor
inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.
Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission
success rate across diverse indoor environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在几何装配任务中表现出色，为解决复杂装配问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的机器人导航方法，通过扩展非线性速度障碍（NLVO）概念，引入加速度障碍（AO）和非线性加速度障碍（NAO），以更好地处理动态环境中的速度和加速度约束。

Motivation: 解决动态环境中机器人导航的挑战，尤其是速度和加速度约束下的实时避障问题。

Method: 扩展NLVO为AO和NAO，利用多机器人共享的避障算法，预测轨迹并计算障碍物。

Result: AO和NAO能够生成更安全的避障路径，同时考虑机器人动力学约束，实现高效实时导航。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂动态环境中具有潜在应用价值，尤其适用于自动驾驶车辆。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for robot navigation in challenging
dynamic environments. The proposed method builds upon the concept of Velocity
Obstacles (VO) that was later extended to Nonlinear Velocity Obstacles (NLVO)
to account for obstacles moving along nonlinear trajectories. The NLVO is
extended in this paper to Acceleration Obstacles (AO) and Nonlinear
Acceleration Obstacles (NAO) that account for velocity and acceleration
constraints. Multi-robot navigation is achieved by using the same avoidance
algorithm by all robots. At each time step, the trajectories of all robots are
predicted based on their current velocity and acceleration to allow the
computation of their respective NLVO, AO and NAO.
  The introduction of AO and NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance
maneuvers that account for the robot dynamic constraints better than could be
done with the NLVO alone. This paper demonstrates the use of AO and NAO for
robot navigation in challenging environments. It is shown that using AO and NAO
enables simultaneous real-time collision avoidance while accounting for robot
kinematics and a direct consideration of its dynamic constraints. The presented
approach enables reactive and efficient navigation, with potential application
for autonomous vehicles operating in complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: PyGemini为海上自主开发提供了一个统一、灵活且高性能的解决方案，支持研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and certifiability of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs)
requires robust decision-making systems, supported by extensive simulation,
testing, and validation across a broad range of scenarios. However, the current
landscape of maritime autonomy development is fragmented -- relying on
disparate tools for communication, simulation, monitoring, and system
integration -- which hampers interdisciplinary collaboration and inhibits the
creation of compelling assurance cases, demanded by insurers and regulatory
bodies. Furthermore, these disjointed tools often suffer from performance
bottlenecks, vendor lock-in, and limited support for continuous integration
workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce PyGemini, a permissively
licensed, Python-native framework that builds on the legacy of Autoferry Gemini
to unify maritime autonomy development. PyGemini introduces a novel
Configuration-Driven Development (CDD) process that fuses Behavior-Driven
Development (BDD), data-oriented design, and containerization to support
modular, maintainable, and scalable software architectures. The framework
functions as a stand-alone application, cloud-based service, or embedded
library -- ensuring flexibility across research and operational contexts. We
demonstrate its versatility through a suite of maritime tools -- including 3D
content generation for simulation and monitoring, scenario generation for
autonomy validation and training, and generative artificial intelligence
pipelines for augmenting imagery -- thereby offering a scalable, maintainable,
and performance-oriented foundation for future maritime robotics and autonomy
research.

Conclusion: 通过更详细的说话人属性建模和局部依赖建模，提升了说话人日志的效果。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Motivation: 尽管零样本TTS在说话人保真度上表现优异，但如何通过调节副/非语言信息来控制语音印象仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用低维向量表示不同语音印象对的强度（如暗-亮），并通过大语言模型生成目标印象向量。

Result: 主客观评估表明该方法在印象控制上有效。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动优化即可通过自然语言描述生成目标印象。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

Abstract: As deep learning advances in audio generation, challenges in audio security
and copyright protection highlight the need for robust audio watermarking.
Recent neural network-based methods have made progress but still face three
main issues: preventing unauthorized access, decoding initial watermarks after
multiple embeddings, and embedding varying lengths of watermarks. To address
these issues, we propose WAKE, the first key-controllable audio watermark
framework. WAKE embeds watermarks using specific keys and recovers them with
corresponding keys, enhancing security by making incorrect key decoding
impossible. It also resolves the overwriting issue by allowing watermark
decoding after multiple embeddings and supports variable-length watermark
insertion. WAKE outperforms existing models in both watermarked audio quality
and watermark detection accuracy. Code, more results, and demo page:

Motivation: 解决文本到音乐系统中整体音乐质量（OMQ）和文本提示对齐（TA）的双重评估挑战。

Method: 使用Whisper Base预训练模型进行音频编码，Qwen 3 SLM进行文本编码，结合序列级共注意和最优传输正则化。

Result: 在MusicEval Track-1数据集上，OMQ的Spearman相关性提高7%，TA提高14%。最优传输正则化贡献最大性能提升（10% SRCC）。

Conclusion: 显式跨模态对齐对文本到音乐评估至关重要，WhisQ在双重评估任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

*Xutong Jin,Bo Pang,Chenxi Xu,Xinyun Hou,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示的新方法Neural Acoustic Transfer，用于实时预测动态变化环境中的声场，解决了传统方法在复杂场景中难以实时处理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学传输方法依赖大量预计算数据，难以应对动态变化的物体位置、材质和尺寸导致的声效变化。

Method: 利用隐式神经表示编码预计算的声学传输及其变化，开发了快速蒙特卡洛边界元方法（BEM）近似和GPU加速的标准BEM生成训练数据。

Result: 方法在数值精度和运行效率（30秒音频仅需几毫秒）上表现优异，适用于动态环境中的声学建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟现实、增强现实等交互应用提供了高效准确的动态声学建模解决方案。

Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and
storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However,
these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in
object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These
continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,
making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render
efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic
Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to
encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time
prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate
the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast
Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general
scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a
GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher
precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our
neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate
our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several
milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in
diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and
accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which
can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality,
augmented reality, and advanced audio production.

TL;DR: TESS卫星通过全帧图像模式观测天空，发现并验证了10001个食双星系统，其中7936个为新发现，2065个为已知系统的更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究食双星系统，因其在恒星形成和演化研究中的重要性。

Method: 利用神经网络筛选TESS数据，结合自动方法和公民科学家的手动检查。

Result: 发布了一个包含10001个食双星的目录，并提供了约90万个未验证目标的列表。

Conclusion: TESS数据为食双星研究提供了丰富资源，未来可进一步探索潜在有趣系统。

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

### [393] [A Red Teaming Roadmap Towards System-Level Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05376)
*Zifan Wang,Christina Q. Knight,Jeremy Kritz,Willow E. Primack,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM红队测试研究未聚焦正确问题，应优先测试产品安全规范、现实威胁模型及系统级安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队测试研究未充分关注实际威胁和系统安全，需调整优先级以应对AI快速发展的新威胁。

Method: 提出红队测试应聚焦三点：明确产品安全规范、现实威胁模型及系统级安全。

Result: 当前研究未有效应对新威胁，需调整研究方向。

Conclusion: 红队测试研究应优先实际安全需求，以应对AI快速发展带来的新威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

TL;DR: 本文研究了黑盒对抗攻击在计算机视觉中的可行性，提出了一种名为ECLIPSE的新方法，通过高斯模糊和局部代理模型优化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习系统（如自动驾驶）易受对抗样本攻击，而现有方法往往在多个评估标准间难以平衡。

Method: 提出ECLIPSE方法，结合高斯模糊处理采样梯度和局部代理模型。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，ECLIPSE在鲁棒性、自动检测隐蔽性和人类检查隐蔽性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: ECLIPSE为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一种更优的解决方案，平衡了多种评估标准。

Abstract: Deep learning systems, critical in domains like autonomous vehicles, are
vulnerable to adversarial examples (crafted inputs designed to mislead
classifiers). This study investigates black-box adversarial attacks in computer
vision. This is a realistic scenario, where attackers have query-only access to
the target model. Three properties are introduced to evaluate attack
feasibility: robustness to compression, stealthiness to automatic detection,
and stealthiness to human inspection. State-of-the-Art methods tend to
prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between
the three properties.

### [395] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FERRET是一种基于1-bit梯度压缩的方法，通过互信息差分隐私（MI-DP）实现高效、隐私保护的训练，性能优于DPSGD，接近非隐私训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在梯度压缩中实现隐私保护，同时保持高效性和模型性能，解决隐私、效用和性能的权衡问题。

Method: 基于signSGD，提出FERRET方法，通过Bernoulli掩码传输每组参数至多一个符号位，结合子采样控制隐私损失。

Result: FERRET在多个粒度下优于DPSGD，隐私保护效果接近DPSGD，训练速度更快，且在特定情况下接近非隐私训练的性能。

Conclusion: FERRET通过符号位MI-DP实现了隐私、效用和性能的平衡，无需添加噪声，训练速度更快且性能更优。

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对二进制代码相似性检测（BCSD）模型的优化对抗攻击方法，利用黑盒解释器定位关键代码片段，显著提高了攻击成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法依赖启发式或贪心算法，缺乏理论基础且效率低，尤其在处理复杂程序时。本文旨在改进针对特定范围预测的对抗攻击。

Method: 利用黑盒、模型无关的解释器分析模型决策边界，定位关键代码片段并施加语义保留扰动。

Result: 相比现有方法，所提攻击在几乎所有场景下攻击成功率更高，同时提升了效率和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有BCSD模型的脆弱性，亟需增强其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

Method: 基于ModernBERT-large架构，利用多样化数据集（包括开源和私有数据）进行微调，涵盖多种攻击类型和良性指令。

Result: 在内部测试集上平均准确率为0.987，F1分数为0.980；在公开基准测试中优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Sentinel通过先进架构和数据集，显著提升了提示注入攻击的检测能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced
features and fine-tuning on an extensive and diverse dataset comprising a few
open-source and private collections, Sentinel achieves state-of-the-art
performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's
architecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a
thorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法要么破坏生成文本的原始分布，要么仅支持零比特信息嵌入，无法实现来源识别。

Method: 提出StealthInk方案，通过嵌入多比特信息（如用户ID、时间戳等）实现隐蔽水印，同时保持文本分布。

Result: 实验证明StealthInk在隐蔽性、可检测性和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: StealthInk是一种有效的大型语言模型水印解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Result: 实验表明，尽管水印技术受到关注，但其对LLMs实用性和下游任务的影响限制了实际应用。

Conclusion: 需开发更实用的水印解决方案，以适应LLMs的部署需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged
as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior
research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated
code. In this work, we introduce \benchmark, a benchmark specifically designed
to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide
range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types.
Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that
leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging
to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code.
Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we

Motivation: LLM代理易受提示注入攻击，传统防御方法繁琐或无效。

Method: 采用Polymorphic Prompt Assembling（PPA），动态变化系统提示结构，使攻击者难以预测。

Result: 实验表明PPA能有效防御现有攻击，且性能开销极低。

Conclusion: PPA是一种高效、轻量级的防御机制，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

Motivation: 预训练编码器模型在深度学习中广泛应用，但其可能导致训练数据隐私泄露，尤其是成员推理攻击（MIAs）的威胁。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了对比学习框架的隐私泄露风险，为编码器模型的隐私保护研究提供了实践基础，呼吁关注自监督学习模型的隐私风险。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SeroneySun/LpLA_code.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）后门攻击的轻量级防御框架，通过仅微调解码器和文本嵌入层，结合两种正则化方法，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御技术通常针对单模态模型或依赖训练时的监督知识，而实际场景中防御者无法修改冻结的视觉编码器或核心LLM参数，也无法预知未知触发器或目标响应。因此，需要一种无需核心权重或攻击先验的防御方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为Robust Instruction Tuning的防御框架，仅微调解码器和文本嵌入层，并集成两种正则化方法：输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化，以破坏后门触发器的关联。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上对七种攻击的实验表明，该方法将攻击成功率降至接近零，且训练成本仅增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级设计和无需核心权重修改的特性，为LVLMs提供了一种高效的后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

Conclusion: QA-HFL在准确性和隐私保护上均优于现有方法，适用于异构设备环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: 基础模型在对抗攻击下存在显著漏洞，需进一步研究以提高其安全性。

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

TL;DR: 论文提出Sylva框架，通过两阶段个性化协作对抗训练，提升边缘计算中模型的鲁棒性和准确性，同时显著降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中预训练模型的部署易受对抗攻击威胁，现有联邦对抗训练方法难以处理数据分布的异质性且通信成本高。

Method: Sylva采用两阶段方法：1) 使用LoRA进行本地对抗微调以减少通信成本；2) 引入基于游戏的层选择策略优化良性数据准确性。

Result: 实验表明，Sylva在通信效率上提升50倍，对抗鲁棒性和良性数据准确性分别提升29.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: Sylva为边缘计算提供了高效且个性化的防御模型，平衡了鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

Result: 在合成和真实基准任务中表现优异，并提供了理论收敛速度和聚类成功率的界限。

Conclusion: \acronym算法在联邦和隐私保护场景下有效解决了k-means聚类问题。

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Joint-GCG框架首次统一了检索和生成阶段的梯度攻击，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统依赖外部知识，易受文档注入攻击，现有攻击方法效果有限。

Method: 提出Joint-GCG框架，通过跨词汇投影、梯度标记对齐和自适应加权融合统一攻击。

Result: 攻击成功率最高提升25%，平均提升5%，且具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: Joint-GCG重塑了对RAG系统漏洞的理解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出Stealix方法，无需预定义提示即可进行模型窃取，利用遗传算法优化提示生成合成图像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型窃取对机器学习安全构成威胁，现有方法依赖人工设计提示，限制了自动化和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Stealix方法，结合两个预训练模型推断受害者模型数据分布，通过遗传算法迭代优化提示。

Result: 实验表明，Stealix在相同查询预算下显著优于其他方法，包括使用类名或精细提示的方法。

Conclusion: 预训练生成模型在模型窃取中的风险可能被低估，Stealix展示了更高的可扩展性和威胁性。

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency

Conclusion: 区域表示为神经网络的可解释性提供了可行路径，且适用于逻辑和格表示。

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Motivation: 传统推荐方法（如协同过滤或基于内容的模型）难以捕捉用户的潜在偏好和复杂关系，而金融科技的发展使得个性化推荐变得更为重要。

Method: 使用预训练的LLM编码文本数据（如用户评论），构建异构用户-产品图建模交互和社交关系，通过定制化的消息传递机制在GNN中融合文本和图信息。

Result: 在公开和真实金融数据集上的实验表明，该模型在准确性、召回率和NDCG上优于单独的LLM或GNN，并具有强可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化金融推荐及跨模态融合提供了新思路，适用于更广泛的推荐任务。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'
latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework
integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial
recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.

Method: 提出异构时序感知图神经网络（HSAL-GNN），结合时序物品序列嵌入和高阶用户嵌入，并与多种序列学习算法（如Transformer、GNN、自编码器）进行对比。

Result: 在三个合成和三个真实数据集上的实验表明，引入时序物品序列信息显著提升了推荐性能。

Conclusion: 时序物品序列信息对推荐系统至关重要，HSAL-GNN在性能上优于或等同于不考虑时序信息的推荐方法。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在多参数二次优化问题（mp-QP）中无法提供最优且可行的预测，即使在大数据集上训练。

Method: PSNN直接从优化问题的数学性质中推导大部分模型权重，减少对训练数据的依赖。

Result: PSNN在解精度和预测速度上优于商业求解器和传统深度神经网络，尤其在极端测试数据上表现突出。

Conclusion: PSNN能快速生成最优解，适用于能源管理等领域的仿真和长期规划。

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

Result: 在空间混合条件或马尔可夫链快速混合条件下，两种层次结构均能快速收敛，并提供严格的上下界。

Conclusion: 该方法在特定条件下优于蒙特卡洛方法，能够提供高效且严格的期望值近似。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

Conclusion: 研究表明，学生愿意将AI作为人类教学的补充，但需透明政策和教师指导以确保信任和学习效果。

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44
semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised
ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data
emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their
most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics
to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent
disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was
driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,
influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The
increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people
grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal
information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof,
was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw
on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive,
marginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services.

TL;DR: 论文探讨科学推荐系统过度依赖流行度导致的问题，并提出通过用户定制化和新技术（如词嵌入和LLMs）提升用户自主性的改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学推荐系统（如Google Scholar）的算法依赖流行度，导致少数高影响力论文垄断可见性，抑制创新和多样性，加剧结构性不平等。

Method: 提出对搜索平台进行改革，引入用户定制化功能，允许手动调整流行度、时效性和相关性等权重，并利用词嵌入和LLMs增强用户自主性。

Result: 改进方案旨在减少算法偏见，促进科学多样性，同时提升信息获取系统的动态性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过增强用户自主性，科学推荐系统可以更好地支持创新和多样性，这一理念也适用于广义的信息访问系统。

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust
and dynamic information

starting with organizational and broad pedagogical principles. We provide a
materialized graph for the Prototype Open Knowledge Network use-case, and
validate it using competency questions sourced from domain experts and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小型本地部署LLM的开源框架，用于生成定制化教学材料和评估，解决了现有教育工具成本高和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有教育工具依赖云基础设施或专有工具，成本高且存在隐私问题，而预算有限的行业需要经济实惠的自托管解决方案。

Method: 采用3B-7B参数的小型本地部署LLM，结合交互式循环和辅助LLM验证器，利用RAG/CAG生成准确的教学内容。

Result: 通过评估流程和大学物理试点验证，小型LLM系统在特定任务中表现与大型模型相当，且更经济、安全。

Conclusion: 精心设计的小型LLM系统能为教育者提供经济、实用且安全的支持，适用于特定任务。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an
evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that
carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical,
and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for
targeted tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用量子超网络优化二元神经网络（BiNNs）的方法，通过量子计算生成二元权重，并利用量子现象如叠加和纠缠扩展解空间。实验表明该方法优于传统最大似然估计（MLE），提升了训练性和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 二元神经网络（BiNNs）虽能减少内存和功耗，但其训练仍具挑战性。量子计算提供了一种新的优化范式。

Method: 采用变分量子算法生成二元权重，并结合贝叶斯推断推导证据下界（ELBO），在模拟和实际场景中分别使用直接输出分布和最大均值差异（MMD）度量。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在训练性和泛化能力上优于传统最大似然估计（MLE）。

Conclusion: 量子超网络为优化BiNNs提供了有效途径，结合量子计算和贝叶斯推断显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用文本的微调策略，用于低资源领域适应ASR，无需额外音频数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境下，适应新领域对语音LLMs具有挑战性，尤其是缺乏配对语音-文本数据时。

Method: 通过引入实时评估机制，仅使用目标领域未配对文本进行微调，保持语音-文本对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，性能接近全音频-文本微调，且能避免灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 文本微调策略在低资源领域适应中具有潜力，且能保持源领域性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）作为自动评估工具来评判语音生成模型的说话风格，发现ALLMs（如Gemini-2.5-pro）与人类评估结果一致性较高，但现有语音模型在风格控制和自然对话生成上仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ALLMs是否能作为自动评估工具，评判语音生成模型（SLMs）在说话风格（如情感、音量、语速等）上的表现，并与人类评估结果对比。

Method: 使用四种语音模型（SLMs）完成两项任务（语音风格指令跟随和角色扮演），并通过人类和ALLMs（GPT-4o-audio和Gemini-2.5-pro）评估结果。

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro与人类评估结果的一致性接近人类评估者之间的一致性，表明ALLMs可作为评估工具；但现有语音模型在风格控制和自然对话生成上仍需改进。

Conclusion: ALLMs（尤其是Gemini-2.5-pro）可作为语音生成模型的评估工具，但语音模型在风格控制和对话自然性上仍需优化。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

TL;DR: CO-VADA是一种无需修改模型架构或依赖人口统计信息的去偏方法，通过语音转换生成增强样本以减少语音情感识别中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别系统中存在由说话者特征与情感标签之间的虚假相关性导致的偏见，现有去偏方法通常需要模型修改或人口统计信息，限制了实用性。

Method: CO-VADA通过识别反映训练数据中偏见模式的样本，并应用语音转换生成增强样本，引入与数据主导模式不同的说话者变化。

Result: 该方法兼容多种语音情感识别模型和语音转换工具，提高了系统的公平性。

Conclusion: CO-VADA是一种可扩展且实用的解决方案，能够在不依赖人口统计信息的情况下减少语音情感识别中的偏见。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

Result: 算法实现了对更强基准的α近似次线性遗憾，实验验证了策略的实际优越性。

Conclusion: 安全投标策略在实践中表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

Conclusion: 分裂预言机能够帮助算法超越传统层次聚类方法，克服硬性约束，并适用于子线性设置。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

TL;DR: Pegasus提出了一种将深度学习操作转化为数据平面原语的方法，解决了当前数据平面与DL推理不匹配的问题，提高了准确性、规模和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据平面的MAT抽象与DL推理不匹配，导致准确性下降、规模受限和缺乏通用性。

Method: Pegasus通过Partition、Map和SumReduce三个原语实现通用性，并采用Primitive Fusion和全精度权重提升可扩展性和准确性。

Result: 在P4交换机上实现，支持多种DL模型，平均准确性提升22.8%，模型规模和输入规模分别提升248倍和212倍。

Conclusion: Pegasus有效解决了数据平面DL推理的局限性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

Conclusion: 讨论了去中心化内容审核的开放性、安全性和复杂性，提出了未来设计方向。

Abstract: Community-level blocklists are key to content moderation practices in
decentralized social media. These blocklists enable moderators to prevent other
communities, such as those acting in bad faith, from interacting with their own
-- and, if shared publicly, warn others about communities worth blocking. Prior
work has examined blocklists in centralized social media, noting their
potential for collective moderation outcomes, but has focused on blocklists as
individual-level tools. To understand how moderators perceive and utilize
community-level blocklists and what additional support they may need, we
examine social media communities running Mastodon, an open-source microblogging
software built on the ActivityPub protocol. We conducted (1) content analysis
of the community-level blocklist ecosystem, and (2) semi-structured interviews
with twelve Mastodon moderators. Our content analysis revealed wide variation
in blocklist goals, inclusion criteria, and transparency. Interviews showed
moderators balance proactive safety, reactive practices, and caution around
false positives when using blocklists for moderation. They noted challenges and
limitations in current blocklist use, suggesting design improvements like
comment receipts, category filters, and collaborative voting. We discuss
implications for decentralized content moderation, highlighting trade-offs
between openness, safety, and nuance; the complexity of moderator roles; and
opportunities for future design.

Conclusion: MLM4HG通过文本化异构图和统一任务范式，显著提升了模型的泛化能力，为异构图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

Conclusion: 相邻相关分析为分类、预测、参数拟合和预测提供了新途径，并可能推动对复杂系统的深入理解。

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

*Benjamin Smith,Jianhui Gao,Jessica Gronsbell*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: 论文介绍了{fairmetrics} R包，用于评估机器学习模型的公平性，支持多种公平性指标，并提供点估计和区间估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保机器学习模型不会对特定群体产生系统性偏见，避免加剧结构性不平等。

Method: 通过{fairmetrics} R包，评估基于独立性、分离性和充分性的公平性指标。

Result: 该工具提供了便捷的评估框架，支持多种公平性指标，并包含示例数据集。

Conclusion: {fairmetrics}为机器学习模型的公平性评估提供了实用且全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Gen4D是一个自动化生成多样化4D人类动画的管道，结合运动编码、扩散高斯飞溅和背景合成，创建了SportPAL合成数据集，用于解决野外人类活动数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外人类活动数据不足，尤其在体育等不常见领域，数据收集复杂且不切实际。合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法因依赖固定资产库和手工渲染管道而缺乏多样性。

Method: Gen4D结合专家驱动的运动编码、基于扩散的高斯飞溅生成提示引导的虚拟形象，以及人类感知的背景合成，生成多样且逼真的4D人类动画。

Result: 基于Gen4D，创建了SportPAL合成数据集，涵盖棒球、冰球和足球三种运动，为野外人类视觉任务提供了可扩展的合成数据基础。

Conclusion: Gen4D和SportPAL为无需手工建模或场景设计的合成数据集构建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

TL;DR: ODE-GS结合3D高斯点云与神经ODE，实现动态3D场景的长期预测，超越现有方法的时间外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）依赖时间嵌入，仅擅长插值，无法预测未来时间点。ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过冻结时间条件变形模型，训练Transformer编码器总结高斯轨迹，利用神经ODE控制潜在状态演化，实现未来时间点的平滑预测。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升高达10 dB，LPIPS误差减半，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ODE-GS证明连续时间潜在动力学是实现复杂3D场景真实预测的有效途径。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术中，稀疏特征和不一致光照使现有SfM方法重建效果不佳，影响手术精度和安全性。

Method: 提出SurGSplat，通过几何约束逐步优化3D高斯点云，实现血管等关键结构的详细重建。

Result: 实验表明，SurGSplat在新视角合成和姿态估计精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: SurGSplat为手术场景提供了一种高保真且高效的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

Motivation: 现实模拟紧凑双星并合的成本高昂，尤其是在稀疏训练集下，流模型的预测存在不确定性。

Method: 通过贝叶斯神经网络构建条件密度估计器（贝叶斯归一化流），利用密度估计器的精确似然函数对后验分布进行采样，以量化并边缘化流模型的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于基于模拟的引力波观测推断，并有望推广到其他引力波天文学研究中。

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机制设计的框架，用于高质量数据共享，确保激励兼容性和预算平衡，并通过拍卖和代币机制奖励数据提供者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型训练中数据获取的法律、隐私和成本问题，避免依赖不可验证的信任。

Method: 设计了Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA)和Marginal Utility Token (MUT)，结合为Mixed-MIA机制，支持隐私保护和验证。

Result: 机制在理论和实践中优于基于数量和信任的基线，能在预算约束下获取更高质量数据。

Conclusion: 为未来LLM的数据市场提供了可持续和公平的基础。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Result: 讨价还价视角提供了公平且帕累托高效的解决方案，实验验证了框架的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 讨价还价视角为长期贝叶斯说服提供了更清晰和实用的框架，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法为能源市场的高效管理提供了可行解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%
and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择方法依赖平稳性假设，但真实数据通常非平稳，导致方法失效。MPS旨在解决非平稳环境下的模型选择问题。

Method: 结合保形推断和模型置信集，实时更新候选模型集，确保覆盖下一时间段的最佳模型。

Result: 模拟和真实数据分析表明，MPS能高效识别非平稳环境下的最优模型，且生成的集合质量高、基数小。

Conclusion: MPS是一种通用框架，适用于各种数据生成过程、模型类别和评估指标，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在模型假设严格、依赖独立性检验或计算耗时的问题，需改进。

Method: 利用PANM对CPDAG中的无向边排序，通过统计测试确定方向，开发约束算法。

Result: 算法在大样本下具有结构学习一致性，实验显示优于现有非线性DAG方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、鲁棒，适用于非线性ANM下的因果DAG学习。

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Result: 理论和实验证明，该方法在固定计算预算下显著提高了SBI的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算成本高的模拟器提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如ARMA-ARCH）假设固定的依赖类型，可能引入偏差。本文旨在避免这种偏差，采用更灵活的方法适应非平稳时间序列。

Method: 使用移动估计器，通过局部对数似然优化和EMA更新参数（如绝对中心矩），应用于alpha-Stable分布。

Result: 方法成功估计了金融数据（DJIA）的中心、尺度参数和α参数，评估了市场稳定性。

Conclusion: 移动估计器提供了一种自适应非平稳时间序列的有效方法，特别适用于金融数据的极端事件分析。

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

Motivation: 提高不同巡天任务（如Kepler、TESS和未来的PLATO）中行星候选信号识别的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络处理折叠光变曲线，简化架构，并在公开数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: 在TESS和Kepler数据上达到91%的召回率，性能优于Exominer和Astronet-Triage。

Conclusion: DART-Vetter是一种高效、开源的工具，适用于自动化筛选或辅助人工审核。

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

*Linxuan He,Qing-Shan Jia,Ang Li,Hongyan Sang,Ling Wang,Jiwen Lu,Tao Zhang,Jie Zhou,Yi Zhang,Yisen Wang,Peng Wei,Zhongyuan Wang,Henry X. Liu,Shuo Feng*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可证明概率安全的方法，以解决具身AI系统在复杂环境中的大规模部署安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于系统故障罕见且复杂，确保具身AI系统在安全关键领域的安全性是一大挑战。

Method: 引入可证明概率安全，通过统计方法设定概率安全边界，而非穷举所有极端情况。

Result: 该方法为具身AI系统的大规模部署提供了可行性，并允许持续优化安全保证。

Conclusion: 通过理论安全保证与实际部署的桥梁，为安全关键应用中的具身AI系统提供了更安全的部署路径。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对称性的等变滤波器（EqF），用于估计两个刚体之间的相对姿态和角速度，并通过仿真和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在航天器交会对接等应用中，准确估计目标物体的姿态和角速度至关重要，但现有方法难以同时满足可靠性和噪声鲁棒性需求。

Method: 设计了一种等变滤波器（EqF），通过对称性提升和噪声观测两个非共线向量来估计姿态和角速度，并分析了其可观测性和收敛性。

Result: 仿真和实验结果表明，EqF能够有效估计姿态和角速度，并在低速率测量条件下提出改进策略。

Conclusion: EqF在航天应用中具有实际可行性，能够应对噪声和低速率测量的挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative attitude and angular velocity between two
rigid bodies is fundamental in aerospace applications such as spacecraft
rendezvous and docking. In these scenarios, a chaser vehicle must determine the
orientation and angular velocity of a target object using onboard sensors. This
work addresses the challenge of designing an Equivariant Filter (EqF) that can
reliably estimate both the relative attitude and the target angular velocity
using noisy observations of two known, non-collinear vectors fixed in the
target frame. To derive the EqF, a symmetry for the system is proposed and an
equivariant lift onto the symmetry group is calculated. Observability and
convergence properties are analyzed. Simulations demonstrate the filter's
performance, with Monte Carlo runs yielding statistically significant results.
The impact of low-rate measurements is also examined and a strategy to mitigate
this effect is proposed. Experimental results, using fiducial markers and both
conventional and event cameras for measurement acquisition, further validate
the approach, confirming its effectiveness in a realistic setting.

Motivation: 解决无人机在城市环境中执行紧急医疗配送任务时的轨迹优化问题，需满足时间窗口、优先级和避障等复杂约束。

Method: 使用信号时序逻辑（STL）编码任务目标，将建筑物建模为3D凸障碍物，并通过凸可行集（CFS）方法处理避障，最终将问题转化为凸优化问题求解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法能生成动态可行、无碰撞且满足时间约束的轨迹，适用于自主无人机医疗物流。

Conclusion: 该方法为无人机医疗配送提供了一种可扩展且可靠的轨迹规划解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban
environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom
dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with
a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using
Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of
spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as
3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex
Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics,
STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex
optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently
using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free
trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and
reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.

Motivation: 随着淡水需求增加，污水处理厂的高效运行至关重要。然而，其复杂性和大量历史数据使得管理者难以全面理解运行状态，需要智能工具支持。

Method: 采用XAI和机器学习（ML）方法，对真实污水处理厂的历史数据进行分析，提取低维数据空间中的可解释运行模式。

Result: 成功将大量历史数据总结为少数可解释的运行模式，明确了各模式下涉及的变量和设施单元。

Conclusion: XAI方法为污水处理厂的管理提供了高效、可解释的工具，有助于优化运行和决策。

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing deep

Result: 在JOB-CEB基准测试中，平均查询延迟降低21%。

Conclusion: LLM嵌入为查询优化提供实用改进潜力，开辟了基于嵌入的无训练优化器指导新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,
embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

Motivation: 当前IaC生成研究仅关注语法正确性，而忽略了可部署性这一关键指标，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出IaCGen框架（基于LLM的迭代反馈机制）和DPIaC-Eval基准（包含153个真实场景）。

Result: 初始LLM表现差（部署成功率30%以下），但IaCGen将成功率提升至90%以上；用户意图对齐和安全性仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面评估了可部署性为中心的IaC生成，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的代理系统能有效生成高质量测试用例，提升数据集评估准确性，并为RL带来显著优势。

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language

International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner

Conclusion: DesignBench为未来自动化前端开发研究提供了指导，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.

dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

*Chenhui Deng,Yun-Da Tsai,Guan-Ting Liu,Zhongzhi Yu,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: ScaleRTL是一种用于RTL代码生成的推理型大语言模型，通过高质量推理数据和测试时计算扩展，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在RTL代码生成中受限于高质量训练数据的稀缺性和非推理性质，无法克服数据瓶颈和测试时扩展问题。

Method: ScaleRTL通过构建包含丰富RTL知识的长链推理数据集（3.5B tokens），并采用测试时扩展策略，通过迭代自校正提升推理能力。

Result: ScaleRTL在VerilogEval和RTLLM上表现最佳，分别比18个基线模型高出18.4%和12.7%。

Conclusion: ScaleRTL通过推理数据扩展和测试时计算优化，显著提升了RTL代码生成的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型常用于学习图像数据的分布，但像素处理顺序对模型性能至关重要。本文旨在通过观察部分像素预测图像其余部分，并优化像素选择策略以提高重建质量。

Method: 提出了一种改进的ConvNADE模型，适用于实值和彩色图像，并比较了随机像素块与低差异像素块对重建效果的影响。

Result: 实验表明，采用低差异序列选择的像素块能降低测试损失并生成更真实的图像重建结果。

Conclusion: 通过优化像素选择策略，改进的ConvNADE模型在图像重建任务中表现更优，低差异像素块显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织学和MSI的图像形成过程和维度不同，配准这两种模态具有挑战性。

Method: 使用pix2pix模型从MSI合成组织学图像，实现单模态配准。

Result: 初步结果显示合成的组织学图像质量较高，互信息（MI）和结构相似性指数（SSIM）分别提高了+0.924和+0.419。

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,
compared to a baseline U-Net model. Our source code is available on GitHub:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FPDANet的双边多尺度信息融合网络，用于解决胎儿超声图像分类任务中ResNet的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类中表现不佳，因其单向特征传递和缺乏上下文信息关联能力。

Method: 设计了位置注意力机制（DAN）模块和双边多尺度（FPAN）信息融合模块，以增强特征表示和捕获多尺度依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别达到91.05%和100%。

Conclusion: 实验证明FPDANet在胎儿超声图像分类中具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割方法，而这对放疗、手术和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过刚性配准将初始肿瘤标记点传播到其他时间点，并使用点击有效性分类器选择有效点以生成分割。

Result: 在两项测试数据集上，LinGuinE将Dice系数提高了20%以上（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: LinGuinE是一种有效的纵向肿瘤分割方法，适用于任意起始时间点，并在实验中表现最佳。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集未能捕捉真实临床和人口复杂性，限制了皮肤病AI模型的公平性和稳健性。

Method: 数据集包含5450张图像，由认证皮肤科医生标注240种诊断，并测试多种模型架构。

Result: 数据集为皮肤病AI提供了基准性能，探索了解剖和概念线索的整合。

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN为推进真实场景下的皮肤病AI提供了可扩展且具代表性的基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

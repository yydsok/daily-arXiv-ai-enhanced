Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been\nemployed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified\nagent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit\nsophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face\nsignificant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based\nsimulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like\nsocieties at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social\nprocesses as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed\nby a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event\nqueue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component\noptimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one\nbillion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion\npropagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's\nhigh fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information\ndiffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more\nstable and realistic emergent behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Light Society\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8fc7\u5341\u4ebf\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ABMs\uff09\u56e0\u7b80\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6311\u6218\u3002Light Society\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u961f\u5217\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u610f\u89c1\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff08\u8fbe\u5341\u4ebf\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\uff0cLight Society\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Light Society\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

At the micro level, a dynamic trust\nmechanism is designed to enable CAVs to adjust their cooperative strategies in\nresponse to real-time behaviors and historical interactions with both HVs and\nother CAVs. Furthermore, a trust-triggered game-theoretic decision-making\nmodule is integrated to guide each CAV in adapting its cooperation factor and\nexecuting context-aware lane-changing decisions under safety, comfort, and\nefficiency constraints.

The\nfield has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in\nsingle-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal\ndomain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-,\nbi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration.\nThis challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with\nH.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor,\nproviding HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay\nscenario using causal models.

In this study, we present a framework to assess the\npotential of introducing new mobility modes like ridesharing and ridepooling\nfor commuting towards several locations in close vicinity to each other.\n  We test our framework on the case of student mobility to the University of\nW\\\"urzburg, a university with several campus locations and a big and rather\nrural catchment area, where existing public transport options are inconvenient\nand many students commute by car. We combine data on student home addresses and\ncampus visitation times to create demand scenarios. In our case study, we\ncompare the mobility modes of ridesharing and ridepooling to the base case,\nwhere students travel by car on their own. We find that ridesharing has the\npotential to greatly reduce emissions, depending on the percentage of students\nwilling to use the service and their willingness to walk to the departure\nlocation. The benefit of ridepooling is less clear, materializing only if the\nshuttle vehicles are more energy efficient than the student cars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fb7\u56fd\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u901a\u52e4\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u62fc\u8f66\u548c\u5408\u4e58\u670d\u52a1\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11CO2\u6392\u653e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7ef4\u5c14\u8328\u5821\u5927\u5b66\u5b66\u751f\u901a\u52e4\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fb7\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u90e8\u95e8\u5360CO2\u6392\u653e\u768420%\uff0c\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u901a\u52e4\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u79c1\u5bb6\u8f66\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6392\u653e\u3002\u62fc\u8f66\u548c\u5408\u4e58\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u653e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u751f\u5bb6\u5ead\u5730\u5740\u548c\u6821\u56ed\u8bbf\u95ee\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u62fc\u8f66\u3001\u5408\u4e58\u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u9a7e\u8f66\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u62fc\u8f66\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\u548c\u6b65\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u5408\u4e58\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u8f66\u8f86\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62fc\u8f66\u5728\u519c\u6751\u901a\u52e4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u51cf\u6392\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5408\u4e58\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8f66\u8f86\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

By training\nQwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights\nthe impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with\nspecialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in\nlanguage models.

The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified\nin high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further\nentangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In\nthis work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal\nDifference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes\nuncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and\npolicy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs\nconformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated\nrisk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic\ndynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative\npriors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint\n(GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent\naction space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize\nhigh-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted\nexploration under uncertainty.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory\nprediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into\nthe neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite\ndifference physics-based loss function.

Furthermore, learning\nthese representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree\nof freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or\nmore degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably\ngreater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of\narticulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART -\na pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects\nfrom posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations.\nSPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation\ntask, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and\nrepresentation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than\npreviously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as\napplied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a\nreal-world object under spare segmentation supervision.

Driven by\nadvancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and\ntransformer-based models have been extensively studied to enhance receptive\nfields and improve medical image segmentation task. However, they often\nstruggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging\nscenarios such as background clutter and object overlap. Moreover, their\nreliance on the availability of large datasets for improved performance, along\nwith the high computational cost, limit their practicality. To address these\nissues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named\nInceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both\nperformance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic\ncues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the\nmulti-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell\nboundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines\nan Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high\nefficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the\nregions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features\nare fused to get the final segmentation mask.

To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network\n(GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing\nmodalities and recovers the missing data according to its original\ndistribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only\naffects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the\nadjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological\ninformation and important spectral features during the diffusion process.\nExtensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art\nemotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGSDNet\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u6062\u590d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08MERC\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGSDNet\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u56fe\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\u6062\u590d\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u800c\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u7834\u574f\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "GSDNet\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GSDNet\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u56fe\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

This is especially true in\nsituated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new\nhigh-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through\ndemonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work\ntogether to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should\nbe able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this\ninformation to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from\nthe user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large\nlanguage models, we introduce ProVox (\"Proactive Voice\"), a novel framework\nthat enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual\ncollaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to\ncommunicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors\nahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized\nprompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a\nuser's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to\nsuggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the\namount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.\nWe evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation\ntasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the\ncollaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,\nand reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity\nare critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less\nuser burden relative to non-active baselines.

This study presents\nMatchPlant, a modular, graphical user interface-supported, open-source Python\npipeline for UAV-based single-plant detection and geospatial trait extraction.\nMatchPlant enables end-to-end workflows by integrating UAV image processing,\nuser-guided annotation, Convolutional Neural Network model training for object\ndetection, forward projection of bounding boxes onto an orthomosaic, and\nshapefile generation for spatial phenotypic analysis. In an early-season maize\ncase study, MatchPlant achieved reliable detection performance (validation AP:\n89.6%, test AP: 85.9%) and effectively projected bounding boxes, covering 89.8%\nof manually annotated boxes with 87.5% of projections achieving an Intersection\nover Union (IoU) greater than 0.5. Trait values extracted from predicted\nbounding instances showed high agreement with manual annotations (r =\n0.87-0.97, IoU >= 0.4). Detection outputs were reused across time points to\nextract plant height and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with minimal\nadditional annotation, facilitating efficient temporal phenotyping.

While effective, MAR models\nsuffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and\nfeed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite\nmost tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a\ntraining-free generation framework MARch\\'e to address this inefficiency\nthrough two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh.\nCache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling\nseparate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed\nkey/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached\ntoken cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing\ncontextual information over multiple steps. MARch\\'e recognizes this challenge\nand applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh\nidentifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly\ngenerated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation,\nwhile preserving image generation quality. MARch\\'e significantly reduces\nredundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture.\nEmpirically, MARch\\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on\nimage quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for\nefficient masked transformer generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To\naddress these problems, this paper introduces a novel knee joint design\nparadigm employing a dynamically decreasing reduction ratio for explosive\noutput during jump. Analysis of motor output characteristics and knee\nkinematics during jumping inspired a coupling strategy in which the reduction\nratio gradually decreases as the joint extends. A high initial ratio rapidly\nincreases torque at jump initiation, while its gradual reduction minimizes\nmotor speed increments and power losses, thereby maintaining sustained\nhigh-power output.

Most existing methods\nhave two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data\ncollected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and\ntransmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several\ngroups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse\nfeature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively\nreduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training\nby setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not\nupdating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by\nusing NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated\nbased on sliding windows.

Different from\nprevious distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes\nthe time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global\nknowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation\nbased on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the\nteacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency\ndomains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined\nallocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to\nspeech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation\nparadigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set,\nmulti-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated\ndistillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each\ncorrelated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that\nenables inter-set knowledge interaction.

As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and\nunderlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model\npersonality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with\ndiverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific\ndiscoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking\nkey events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires\nreasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small\nmodels like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as\nClaude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another\nLLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection\nand classification of events.

Numerous pruning techniques have\nbeen proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more\ncomplex and harder to interpret as well.

To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we \"use a\nneural network to prune neural networks\".

LLMs are\nremarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from\ncontext, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between\ncomputational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and\nchallenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and\nunderstands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated.\nWe argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs'\ncapabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and\ninfrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on\nLLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We\nframe LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode\nassumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their\ntraining data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how\ncomputational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting\npatterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support\ninterpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and\ngenerative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g.,\ncontinued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and\nevaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry\nin HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1)\nmodel selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is\nfoundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs\nshould enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53f2\u3001\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\uff08HPSS\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u673a\u9047\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u5408LLMs\u7684\u56db\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "HPSS\u9886\u57df\u5f3a\u8c03\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aHPSS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u9700\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u5148\u4e3a\u975e\u6280\u672f\u8bfb\u8005\u4ecb\u7ecdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e2d\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u8f85\u52a9HPSS\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u5728HPSS\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7d20\u517b\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e13\u5c5e\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fddLLMs\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408LLMs\u5230HPSS\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u56db\u70b9\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3001LLM\u7d20\u517b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u3001HPSS\u4e13\u5c5e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8865\u5145\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002"}}

These include genre\nclassification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,\npitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal\ntechnique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music\ntagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges\nin MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized\nevaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models,\nensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an\nevaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including\nLTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant\nperformance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,\nchronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of\ncurrent models in addressing MIR tasks.

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data\ncan offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct\nimplications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of\ninterpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients\nrecovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of\nmultimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS\nlocation, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely\ncollected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately\nfor each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each\nmodality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware\nprompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster\nlabels for the clusters derived from each modality.

Given a new dataset, they need to\ndetermine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the\npretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as\nmodels grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a\nbottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.\nAddressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and\nhyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts\nmeta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.\nWe propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer\nVision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline\nranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune\nlarge language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform\nfinetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and\nsynthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We\nempirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using\nSelf-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies.\nLeveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data\ngenerators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments.\nAdditionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context\nlearning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316DL\u7ba1\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684DL\u7ba1\u9053\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3DL\u9886\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic\ncontent of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the\ncontext of video TTA.

Traditional ReID methods assume\nthat the training and test domains share similar characteristics and primarily\nfocus on learning discriminative features within a given domain. However, they\noften fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by\nvariations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this\nissue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These\napproaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve\nperformance by aligning feature distributions between source and target\ndomains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and\nchallenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without\nrelying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various\nstrategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field\nremains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nsurvey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID\nincluding the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source\ninput configurations.

To examine the broader applicability\nof these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that\nalso involves distribution shifts.

This paper first\nreveals that the degradation is caused by the global-statistics-based modules,\nwidely used in speaker embedding extractors, being overly sensitive to\nintervals containing only non-target speakers. As a countermeasure, we propose\nan extension of such modules that exploit the target speaker activity clues, to\ncompute statistics from intervals where the target is active. The proposed\nmethod improves speaker verification performance in both low and high overlap\nratios, and diarization performance on multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5d4c\u5165\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u91cd\u53e0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u533a\u95f4\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6d3b\u8dc3\u533a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u65e5\u5fd7\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward\n\"overthinking\", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on\nSelf-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior\ncontent and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps.\nObservations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive\nself-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to\nlonger outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through\ndetailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other\nreflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in\nself-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by\nthis insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a\ntrain-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation\nreflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple\nmodels (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also\nimprove current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections.\nIn our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\\% in train-free\nsettings and 50.2\\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B.

In response, the community has introduced\ndedicated benchmarks and tailored detection strategies. As the field advances,\nefforts have moved beyond binary detection toward source attribution, including\nopen-set attribution, which aims to identify the NAC responsible for generation\nand flag novel, unseen ones during inference. This shift toward source\nattribution improves forensic interpretability and accountability. However,\nopen-set attribution remains fundamentally limited: while it can detect that a\nNAC is unfamiliar, it cannot characterize or identify individual unseen codecs.\nIt treats such inputs as generic ``unknowns'', lacking insight into their\ninternal configuration. This leads to major shortcomings: limited\ngeneralization to new NACs and inability to resolve fine-grained variations\nwithin NAC families. To address these gaps, we propose Neural Audio Codec\nSource Parsing (NACSP) - a paradigm shift that reframes source attribution for\nCFs as structured regression over generative NAC parameters such as quantizers,\nbandwidth, and sampling rate. We formulate NACSP as a multi-task regression\ntask for predicting these NAC parameters and establish the first comprehensive\nbenchmark using various state-of-the-art speech pre-trained models (PTMs). To\nthis end, we propose HYDRA, a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic\ngeometry to disentangle complex latent properties from PTM representations.

While recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of\nautomated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction\nerrors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied\nscientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this\ngap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two\nlevels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP\nevaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level\ngraph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and\nconnectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on\naffiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social\nregister books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where\nbiases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero. However, as\nextraction performance declines, we find that many metrics exhibit increasingly\npronounced biases, with each metric tending toward a consistent direction of\neither over- or under-estimation. Through simulations, we further show that\nerror models commonly used in the literature do not capture these bias\npatterns, indicating the need for more realistic error models for KG\nextraction.

D. Dissertation in English(KAIST)", "summary": "Recent research in deep learning-based Sound Event Detection (SED) has\nprimarily focused on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) and\nTransformer models. However, conventional 2D convolution-based models assume\nshift invariance along both the temporal and frequency axes, leadin to\ninconsistencies when dealing with frequency-dependent characteristics of\nacoustic signals. To address this issue, this study proposes Frequency Dynamic\nConvolution (FDY conv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels based\non the frequency composition of the input signal to enhance SED performance.\nFDY conv constructs an optimal frequency response by adaptively weighting\nmultiple basis kernels based on frequency-specific attention weights.\nExperimental results show that applying FDY conv to CRNNs improves performance\non the DESED dataset by 7.56% compared to the baseline CRNN. However, FDY conv\nhas limitations in that it combines basis kernels of the same shape across all\nfrequencies, restricting its ability to capture diverse frequency-specific\ncharacteristics. Additionally, the $3\\times3$ basis kernel size is insufficient\nto capture a broader frequency range. To overcome these limitations, this study\nintroduces an extended family of FDY conv models. Dilated FDY conv (DFD conv)\napplies convolutional kernels with various dilation rates to expand the\nreceptive field along the frequency axis and enhance frequency-specific feature\nrepresentation. Experimental results show that DFD conv improves performance by\n9.27% over the baseline. Partial FDY conv (PFD conv) addresses the high\ncomputational cost of FDY conv, which results from performing all convolution\noperations with dynamic kernels. Since FDY conv may introduce unnecessary\nadaptivity for quasi-stationary sound events, PFD conv integrates standard 2D\nconvolutions with frequency-adaptive kernels to reduce computational complexity\nwhile maintaining performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PFD conv\nimproves performance by 7.80% over the baseline while reducing the number of\nparameters by 54.4% compared to FDY conv. Multi-Dilated FDY conv (MDFD conv)\nextends DFD conv by addressing its structural limitation of applying the same\ndilation across all frequencies. By utilizing multiple convolutional kernels\nwith different dilation rates, MDFD conv effectively captures diverse\nfrequency-dependent patterns. Experimental results indicate that MDFD conv\nachieves the highest performance, improving the baseline CRNN performance by\n10.98%. Furthermore, standard FDY conv employs Temporal Average Pooling, which\nassigns equal weight to all frames along the time axis, limiting its ability to\neffectively capture transient events. To overcome this, this study proposes\nTAP-FDY conv (TFD conv), which integrates Temporal Attention Pooling (TA) that\nfocuses on salient features, Velocity Attention Pooling (VA) that emphasizes\ntransient characteristics, and Average Pooling (AP) that captures stationary\nproperties. TAP-FDY conv achieves the same performance as MDFD conv but reduces\nthe number of parameters by approximately 30.01% (12.703M vs. 18.157M),\nachieving equivalent accuracy with lower computational complexity. Class-wise\nperformance analysis reveals that FDY conv improves detection of non-stationary\nevents, DFD conv is particularly effective for events with broad spectral\nfeatures, and PFD conv enhances the detection of quasi-stationary events.\nAdditionally, TFD conv (TFD-CRNN) demonstrates strong performance in detecting\ntransient events. In the case studies, PFD conv effectively captures stable\nsignal patterns in tank powertrain fault recognition, DFD conv recognizes wide\nharmonic spectral patterns on speed-varying motor fault recognition, while TFD\nconv outperforms other models in detecting transient signals in offshore arc\ndetection. These results suggest that frequency-adaptive convolutions and their\nextended variants provide a robust alternative to conventional 2D convolutions\nin deep learning-based audio processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u5377\u79ef\uff08FDY conv\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u53d8\u4f53\uff08DFD conv\u3001PFD conv\u3001MDFD conv\u3001TFD conv\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf2D\u5377\u79ef\u5728\u58f0\u97f3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08SED\uff09\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2D\u5377\u79ef\u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u8f74\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u58f0\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86SED\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFDY conv\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5377\u79ef\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aDFD conv\uff08\u6269\u5927\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff09\u3001PFD conv\uff08\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff09\u3001MDFD conv\uff08\u591a\u6269\u5f20\u7387\uff09\u548cTFD conv\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "FDY conv\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd7.56%\uff0cDFD conv\u63d0\u53479.27%\uff0cPFD conv\u63d0\u53477.80%\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u657054.4%\uff0cMDFD conv\u63d0\u534710.98%\uff0cTFD conv\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eMDFD\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1130.01%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9891\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5377\u79ef\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Notably, federated low-rank\nadaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which\nallows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters\nlocally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous\nresources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize\nglobal fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we\npropose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that\nenables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local\ntrainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several\nheterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local\ntrainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer\nimportance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a\nFisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm\ninformation. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the\nintrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA\nstrategy.

Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named\nRandomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with\nrandomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both\nthe dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.\nWe evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA\nfine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to\nextreme Non-IID.

Despite the success, ERM avoids\nthe modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which\nis fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training\nenvironment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot\nsystem often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen\nduring training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the\nbiochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as\nCOVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization\nchallenging to conventional machine learning.\n  In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality\nfor broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the\ninvariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM),\nthat is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform\nor influence each other.

However, existing calibration methods\ntypically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data.\nMoreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the\nassociated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these\nissues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground\nrobots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR\n(exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike\ntraditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for\nonline data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more\nintelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information\nmatrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum\neigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline\ncurves.

Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks.

With the MP\nclassification and prioritization, DE-AGT expands the most promising mode of\nMPs first, which eliminates unnecessary computation and finds solutions faster.\nTo obtain the cost-to-go heuristic for nonholonomic articulated vehicles, we\nrely on supervised learning and train neural networks for fast and accurate\ncost-to-go prediction.

Another feature of DE-AGT is the improved goal-reaching.\nExactly reaching a goal state usually requires a constant connection checking\nwith the goal by solving steering problems -- non-trivial and time-consuming\nfor articulated vehicles. The proposed termination scheme overcomes this\nchallenge by tightly integrating a light-weight trajectory tracking controller\nwith the search process.

An\nexcellent example is the rise of 3D printing farms, which consist of multiple\nnetworked 3D printers operating in parallel, enabling faster production and\nefficient mass customization. However, optimizing process parameters across a\nfleet of manufacturing machines, even of the same type, remains a challenge due\nto machine-to-machine variability. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are\ninefficient, requiring extensive testing to determine optimal process\nparameters for an entire fleet.

Typically, existing CBM\nmethods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain\nthe model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of\nconcept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated\nwith the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a\nblind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and\nthus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,\nimpairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nMulti-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),\nwhich comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference\nmodeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with\nfeatures at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse\nactivation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple\nlayers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept\npreferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual\ninformation to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model\ndecisions.

However,\nthese large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from\nmultiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach\nfails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video\ndurations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature\nsignificance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require\nsignificant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them\nimpractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model\nperformance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our\nframework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of\nembeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally\npreserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then\nlearn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing\nus to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a\nnew neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment\nalgorithms for this learning task.

Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological\nattention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to\nvisual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative\nregions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior\nresponse tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal\nalignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system\nprompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response\ncontent. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time\ninterventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus\non salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which\nsuppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens.

To propose solutions, it is crucial to\nfirst characterize involved stakeholders, their goals, and the types of subpar\npractices causing unforeseen outcomes. This task is complex because affected\nstakeholders often fall outside the direct focus of optimization processes.\nAlso, incorporating these externalities into optimization requires going beyond\ntraditional economic frameworks, which often focus on describing externalities\nbut fail to address their normative implications or interconnected nature, and\nfeedback loops. This paper suggests a framework that combines systems thinking\nwith the economic concept of externalities to tackle these challenges. This\napproach aims to characterize what went wrong, who was affected, and how (or\nwhere) to include them in the optimization process. Economic externalities,\nalong with their established quantification methods, assist in identifying \"who\nwas affected and how\" through stakeholder characterization. Meanwhile, systems\nthinking (an analytical approach to comprehending relationships in complex\nsystems) provides a holistic, normative perspective. Systems thinking\ncontributes to an understanding of interconnections among externalities,\nfeedback loops, and determining \"when\" to incorporate them in the optimization.\nTogether, these approaches create a comprehensive framework for addressing\noptimization's unintended consequences, balancing descriptive accuracy with\nnormative objectives. Using this, we examine three common types of subpar\npractices: ignorance, error, and prioritization of short-term goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0d\u5f53\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb3\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7cfb\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

As a result, 1000s\nof hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the\nglobe.

In\nthis work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this\nquestion. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common\nsources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object\ntypes and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with\ncontrolled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that\nwould be prohibitively expensive in the real world.

Our study\nyields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and\nspatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection\nand alignment in retrieval.

Both methods yield reference trajectories\nfor human or artificial drivers: in autonomous applications the modelled\ncontroller can replicate the on-board implementation, while for human driving\naccuracy increases with the extent to which the driver can be approximated by\nthe assumed time-varying LQR policy. Computational tests on a representative\nBarcelona-Catalunya sector show that both schemes meet the prescribed safety\nprobability, yet the closed-loop variant incurs smaller lap-time penalties than\nthe more conservative open-loop solution, while the nominal (non-robust)\ntrajectory remains infeasible under the same uncertainties.

To solve this problem, we\npropose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We\nuse a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of\nthe hands.

While recent studies have\nexplored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional\nautoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy\niterations.

To overcome these challenges, we propose the\nMulti-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified\nfusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost\ndetection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three\nsynergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries\ntoken-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight\nspectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration\nModule, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and\nparallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and\nthe Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps\nto rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen\nresponses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone\nbenchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,\nachieving superior precision and recall with low inference time.

To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust\nestimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency,\nand provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on\nsemi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets:\nMIMIC-IV and eICU.

We also explore how these coupling profiles generate\nfeedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive\nbehavior.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework\nthat dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving\nenvironments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and\nselectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while\nmaintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with\nCNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the\nreinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity,\nensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we\nprove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary\nenvironments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term\nperformances.

While existing models perform well\non novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to\ncomplex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into\nindividual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per\nobject. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric\ndiffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs\njoint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object\nocclusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between\nobject-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,\nGenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering\nconstraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object\nreconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point\ntracks from monocular input.

We introduce VisuoTactile Local\n(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation\ntasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a\nvision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the\nobject of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,\nscene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric\nvision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that\nwhile scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across\ntask instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they\ncan generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%\nsuccess on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to\ndistractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)\nfoundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via\nbehavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies\nlearned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts\nperformance in contact-rich tasks.

As a result,\ntemporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in\nvisual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified\nframework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning\ntokens.

To address spatial\nredundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning\nmethod.

However, existing MLLMs\ntypically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities\nequally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic\ncontribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in\nscenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities.\n  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel\nframework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a\nper-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1)\n\\textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2)\n\\textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3)\n\\textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These\nsignals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate\nsoft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we\nfurther introduce a \\textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which\nregularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings\nproportionally to their assigned weights.

Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize\n\"single-view\" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per\niteration, in contrast to NeRF's \"multi-view\" mini-batch training, which\nleverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead\nto suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic\ngradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However,\nimplementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges.

Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical\nstatistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay\nspread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot\naccurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus\nperforming very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the\nidentification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore,\nthe MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),\nwhich is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion\nmodel. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden\nchannel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of\nthe conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which\ndirectly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario\nidentification.

To address this gap, we\nintroduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding\n(CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress\nfeatures from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose\na two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment\nmethod that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token\nformat. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes\nstatistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt\nto study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior\nrate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method\nfor blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates\napplication across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for\ntraining-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate\nthe features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in\ngeneralization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an\nadaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise\nannealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past\nregularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,\nalso highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

These gains confirm that fusing modern\ndeep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3\naccuracy while preserving its real-time operation.\n  Implementation, pretrained weights and reproducibility scripts are available\nat https://github.com/shahram95/SuperPointSLAM3.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperPoint-SLAM3\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362ORB\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684SuperPoint\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668-\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u6781\u5927\u503c\u6291\u5236\uff08ANMS\uff09\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7NetVLAD\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ORB-SLAM3\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "ORB-SLAM3\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684ORB\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u3002", "method": "(i) \u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763SuperPoint\u66ff\u6362ORB\uff0c(ii) \u901a\u8fc7ANMS\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff0c(iii) \u96c6\u6210\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7NetVLAD\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u548cEuRoC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSuperPoint-SLAM3\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5982KITTI\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece4.15%\u964d\u81f30.34%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u95ed\u73af\u6a21\u5757\uff0cSuperPoint-SLAM3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ORB-SLAM3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002"}}

Snoswell", "Seth Lazar"], "title": "Discerning What Matters: A Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Moral Competence in LLMs", "categories": ["cs.AI", "I.2.0"], "comment": null, "summary": "Moral competence is the ability to act in accordance with moral principles.\nAs large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations\ndemanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this\nability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three\nsignificant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with\nexplicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather\nthan moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to\nrecognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical\nresearch on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral\ncompetence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to\nevaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant\nfeatures, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these\nfeatures, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information\ngaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert\nhumans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical\nvignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert\nhumans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning.

However, it still faces some problems, such as\nthe lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In\norder to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method\nbased on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical\ntwo-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and\nsea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module\n(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on\nland according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add\nprior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby\nreducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore\ndetection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection\nand enhances the interpretability of the model.

To operationalize this insight, we first propose\nthe Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps\nby maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped\nfeatures. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant\nerror surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly\nwithin Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop\nthe Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the\nupstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs.

The results\nshow that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the\nperformance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks.\nCode is available at https://github.com/Niujunbo2002/NativeRes-LLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRC-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cNativeRes-LLaVA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u957f\u5bbd\u6bd4\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RC-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684VLM\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faNativeRes-LLaVA\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u539f\u751f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u539f\u751f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NativeRes-LLaVA\u548cRC-Bench\u4e3aVLM\u5728\u591a\u6837\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

They are widely used\nnowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving\nadvancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work,\nwe focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which\nwe refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which\nboth inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly\nsuitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached\nbinary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the\nAlchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key\ninsights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary\nANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically\nrepresented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of\nmodifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a\ngradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,\nthe training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set\ntransitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief\nchange. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we\nshow that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured,\ngradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known\nshortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training\ndynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style\nchange operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction --\nthat align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANNs\uff09\u7684\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff08AGM\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236ANNs\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u503c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff08AGM\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u548cDalal\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408lexicographic\u4fee\u8ba2\u548cmoderate\u6536\u7f29\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236ANNs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236ANNs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u7528\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236ANNs\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684AGM\u98ce\u683c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In contrast to conventional\nself-learning approaches, our proposed framework offers an event-driven control\nstrategy and game-theoretic learning algorithms. The players collaborate with\nthe PID controllers to dynamically adjust their gains in response to set point\nchanges and disturbances. We provide a theoretical analysis showing sound\nconvergence guarantees for the game given suitable stability ranges of the PID\ncontrolled loop.

SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated\nrasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP\nto model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing\nmobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the\nefficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)\nprediction.

In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de\nfacto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically\nthis term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a\ncorrelation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in\nevery case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must\nbe carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and\nrecast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting\nteacher logits as \"worth\" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation\n(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers\nknowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its\nown confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the\ntrue label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher\nconfidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes\nweighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification\nbenchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST\n(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous\nsettings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in\nheterogeneous settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePlackett-Luce\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5PLD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684logits\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u201c\u4ef7\u503c\u201d\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u84b8\u998f\u9879\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u9879\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f20\u9012\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6392\u540d\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Plackett-Luce\u84b8\u998f\uff08PLD\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u6743\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6392\u540d\u4f20\u9012\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPLD\u5728\u5747\u5300\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u6bd4DIST\u548cKD\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PLD\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To\naddress this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for\ntraining, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks.

In this paper, we propose a novel training\nstrategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing\nperformance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of\nthe underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs\nfor effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct\nhazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which\nis theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images.\nAdditionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch\nframework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic\ndehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the\ngeneralization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new\ndehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which\nprogressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine.

Wilson"], "title": "Semivalue-based data valuation is arbitrary and gameable", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.GT"], "comment": "29 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for\ncredit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a\ncomposition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual\ninstantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this\nunderspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based\nvaluations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can\ninduce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these\nvaluation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial\nstrategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute\nvalue among datapoints.

In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one\nspecialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning\nLLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share\nthree findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact\nverifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors\nand ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\\% of ambiguous\nor incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting\nthis issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,\nand we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help\nidentify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with\nfew-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve\ntop-tier performance.

Traditional methods predominantly rely on\nflow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches\nface limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and\nensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when\ndealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas\nremains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel\nvideo inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT\nsynergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer\narchitectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring\nhigh-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy\nto further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.\nAdditionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,\ninteractively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.\nIn terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA\nA100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \\times 1920$ with 121\nframes without any acceleration method.

While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group\ntogether semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids\nboth to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key\nvectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update\nprocess to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,\nthereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We\nevaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our\napproach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive\nattention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to\ndemonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to\n4.5$\\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

While ICL has been highly\nsuccessful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks\nthat require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not\nonly about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select\ndemonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to\nshow them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM\nwith retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently\nannotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that\nset-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly\nimproves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents.\nHowever, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead.

We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier\nmodels (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context\nconditions.

However, perceptual\nerrors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and\nclinically significant.

We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error\ndataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection\nover Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision\nof 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the\nsimulated perceptual-error dataset.

A\nbasic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels\nstates that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon,\nLivni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim,\nand Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does\nnot hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike\nin the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the\nclassical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list\nlearnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability.\nHowever, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary\ncondition.\n  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example\nshowing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over\n$\\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This\nleads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \\emph{$k$-monotone\ndimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike\nthe multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are\nfinite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do\nnot exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is\nanother necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite\n$k$-Littlestone dimension.

To address this,\nsemi-structured sparsity offers a promising solution by strategically retaining\n$N$ elements out of every $M$ weights, thereby enabling hardware-friendly\nacceleration and reduced memory. However, existing (N:M)-compatible approaches\ntypically fall into two categories: rule-based layerwise greedy search, which\nsuffers from considerable errors, and gradient-driven combinatorial learning,\nwhich incurs prohibitive training costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose\na novel linear-space probabilistic framework named MaskPro, which aims to learn\na prior categorical distribution for every $M$ consecutive weights and\nsubsequently leverages this distribution to generate the (N:M)-sparsity\nthroughout an $N$-way sampling without replacement. Furthermore, to mitigate\nthe training instability induced by the high variance of policy gradients in\nthe super large combinatorial space, we propose a novel update method by\nintroducing a moving average tracker of loss residuals instead of vanilla loss.\nFinally, we conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments to validate the superior performance of MaskPro, as well as its\nexcellent scalability in memory efficiency and exceptional robustness to data\nsamples.

It extends conventional Video Crowd\nCounting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that\nonly learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key\nproblem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which\nturns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,\nmainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian\nmust be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance\nvariations or missing detections.

Repeating a\nnew word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for\nadults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to\nsystematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the\nlocation of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various\ncomponents for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.\nWhile some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the\nbrain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition\nremain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive\nmodel of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling\nthe task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable,\nallowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and\nmake comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make\nfirst steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to\nsimulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the\nmodels for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating\nbrain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons\nfrom the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech\nerrors in the \"patient\" model.

However, these\nmethods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate\nmatching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation\ninstability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause\npotential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,\nan innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and\nharmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.\nSpecifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and\nRoberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,\nrespectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to\nproduce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch\ndeformation.

Recent advances in this\narea have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to\neffectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In\nthis work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term\nAttention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models\nlong- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content\nassociated with items, such as product descriptions.\n  C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content\nlinked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and\nshort-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both\nbehavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item\nrepresentations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with\ntextual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization\ncapacity of recommendation systems.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking\nC-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential\nrecommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction\nhistory and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that\nC-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction\ntasks.

Due to limited planning\ntime and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to\ncurate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses\nthe critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in\nselecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme,\nsubtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have\ndeveloped a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher\nScaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based\non pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph.\nWe constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and\nRepresentation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which\nwas then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both\napproaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation\nperformance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank\n(MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG).

However, existing methods\nstruggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under\nbroad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute\na dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image\nposes and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method\nis evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The\nmethod consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm\ncompared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.\nFurthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully\nautomatic.

Existing GNNs, unfortunately,\nfail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the\ndepth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world\nscenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing\nGraph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction,\nenhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong\npredictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop\npropagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of\neach node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a\nparameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to\nleverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve\nthe trustworthiness of the final prediction.

In general adversarial online learning settings, both\nalgorithms may exhibit instability and linear regret due to no regularization\n(Fictitious Play) or small amounts of regularization (Gradient Descent).\nHowever, their ability to obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum\ngames is less understood. In this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees\nfor both algorithms on a class of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the\nclassic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors to a weighted, n-dimensional regime.\nUnder symmetric initializations of the players' strategies, we prove that\nFictitious Play with any tiebreaking rule has $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret,\nestablishing a new class of games for which Karlin's Fictitious Play conjecture\nholds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the geometry of the\niterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space of payoff\nvectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for almost all symmetric\ninitializations, obtains a similar $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize\nis a sufficiently large constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes the\nfirst \"fast and furious\" behavior (i.e., sublinear regret without\ntime-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than 2x2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u975e\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u96f6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u6052\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08\uff09\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u53cc\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u9057\u61be\u754c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u5bf9\u79f0\u96f6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u4e09\u7b56\u7565\u526a\u5200\u77f3\u5934\u5e03\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u52a0\u6743n\u7ef4\u60c5\u5f62\u3002\u5728\u73a9\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u79f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5e73\u5c40\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u5177\u6709$O(\\sqrt{T})$\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Karlin\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08\u731c\u60f3\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b65\u957f\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u65f6\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5927\u4e8e2x2\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u201c\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9c81\u83bd\u201d\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5373\u65e0\u9700\u6b65\u957f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\uff09\u3002"}}

However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant\ndata efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high\nspatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks\n(DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph\ncondensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic\ngraphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel\nframework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while\nfaithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics.\nSpecifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a\nnovel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the\ndynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in\ndynamic graphs.

This study presents, for the first time,\na comprehensive analysis combining dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index\n(DpRVI) with optical indices to characterize vineyard crops. Vineyards exhibit\ndistinct non-isotropic scattering behavior due to their pronounced row\norientation, making them particularly challenging and interesting targets for\nremote sensing. The research further investigates the relationship between\nDpRVI and optical vegetation indices, demonstrating the complementary nature of\ntheir information. We demonstrate that DpRVI and optical indices provide\ncomplementary information, with low correlation suggesting that they capture\ndistinct vineyard features. Key findings reveal a parabolic trend in DpRVI over\nthe growing season, potentially linked to biomass dynamics estimated via the\nWinkler Index. Unlike optical indices reflecting vegetation greenness, DpRVI\nappears more directly related to biomass growth, aligning with specific\nphenological phases.

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and\nmolecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge\nand is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and\ntime-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep\nlearning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However,\ndue to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning\nfrom datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to\nperformance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this\ncontext, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid\nthis performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without\nexternal labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders\n(MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The\nmain contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine\nvarieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application\nin the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models\nacross seasons.

We introduce a likelihood-guided noise\nrefinement mechanism that derives a closed-form approximation of the likelihood\nscore, simplifying score estimation and avoiding expensive gradient\ncomputations. This estimated score is subsequently utilized to refine the\nmodel-predicted noise, thereby better aligning the restoration process with the\ngenerative framework of diffusion models. In addition, we integrate the\nDenoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) sampling strategy to further improve\ninference efficiency. The proposed mechanism can be applied to both\noptimization-based and sampling-based schemes, providing an effective and\nflexible zero-shot solution for imaging inverse problems.

Recently, Nguyen et al.\n2024's \"Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM\nOutputs\" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior\nquality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p\nsampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's\nrecognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection\nfor an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of\nthe evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the\noriginal paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human\nevaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and\ndescribed qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p\ndid not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between\nquality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original\npaper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,\nand rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve\nover baselines.

In this paper, we propose\ncontext-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that\ninitializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our\nmethod enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)\nand instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between\nfreezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or\nadapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin.

Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g.,\nMatplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually\nrequires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to\nwork on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to\nautomatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering\nfrom limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and\naccurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent\ngeometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions\nto represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint\nfunctions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally\nby rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our\nGeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements\nand those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be\nself-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual\nplausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school\nlevel and IMO-level geometry diagrams.

To address this\nchallenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending\nplan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design\ngeneral (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to\nbaselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our\nalgorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution\nof the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our\nmethods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly\nimbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing\nagainst benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u51fa\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u53cc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4efb\u610f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u51fa\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u53cc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u652f\u51fa\u8ba1\u5212\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u652f\u51fa\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0e\u504f\u79bb\u652f\u51fa\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u7ade\u4e89\u65f6\u7684\u9057\u61be\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Despite some\nresearch efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most\nsolutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain\nanalysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the\noverlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum.\nBased on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized\nAnti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more\ntexture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for\nanti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency\nSpatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features\nfrom both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more\ntexture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the\nHierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in\nthe separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially\ndesigned consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses\nthe response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the\nperception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate\nthe effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further\nimproves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically\nfor the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection,\nProhibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection.

Experiments across language modeling, long-context\nquestion answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only\nsurpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and\naccuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables\nseamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual\narchitectural redesign.

It then uses this\ncontext to generate syntactically correct and semantically aligned SQL code.\nThe paper details the architecture, training methodology, and retrieval logic,\nhighlighting how the system bridges the gap between user intent and database\nstructure without requiring SQL expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Datrics Text2SQL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u9886\u57df\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6587\u6863\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u793a\u4f8b\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684SQL\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9700SQL\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "Datrics Text2SQL\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This work aims to develop a clinically\nfeasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive\nlimited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or\ndose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated\ncycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic\ncone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing\nprojections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.\nThis dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and\nimage spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90\ndegrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.\nFour board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78\nplanning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation.\nThe method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of\n29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity.\nLA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic\nforward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast\nreconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and\ndose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong\ndata fidelity and anatomical realism.

Rewards that actively discourage\nexploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can\npose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable\nError-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and\nexploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of\nmaximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three\ndesign choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the\nconflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic\nsetting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with\noff-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the\noriginal objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor\nCritic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse\nreward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5SEE\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u5229\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8c03\u53c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u8c03\u53c2\uff0cSEE\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SEE\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316TD\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SEE\u7684Soft-Actor Critic\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "SEE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.\n  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a\njailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,\ninformation-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.\nSpecifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase\nmalicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is\nunsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the\nfailure while preserving its malicious intent.\n  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used\nLLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their\njailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks,\nachieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak\nbenchmarks.

For\ncost-efficient solutions, vibration-based condition monitoring is especially of\ninterest. However, analyzing high-resolution vibration data via traditional\ncloud approaches incurs significant energy and communication costs, hindering\nbattery-powered edge deployments. This necessitates shifting intelligence to\nthe sensor edge. Due to their event-driven nature, Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs) offer a promising pathway toward energy-efficient on-device processing.\nThis paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow,\npressure, pump speed) and multi-label classification (normal, overpressure,\ncavitation) for an industrial progressing cavity pump (PCP) using 3-axis\nvibration data. Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing\nthe SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware\nplatforms. Results demonstrate high classification accuracy (>97%) with zero\nFalse Negative Rates for critical Overpressure and Cavitation faults.

A fundamental operation in these networks is the\ntensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner\nto create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor\nproduct, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this\noperation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor\nproduct (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a\ncareful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In\nparticular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the\nsame operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of\nexpressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to\ncharacterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original\nimplementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical\ngrid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster\non our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by\n30\\%.

To address this,\nseveral simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data.\nAmong these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision\nsensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential,\nthe sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently\nstudied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by\ntraining a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data\ngenerated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic\nand real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely\non synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer\nsignificant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data\nincreases.

Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial\ntraining and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but\nthese methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant\ncomputational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose\nSecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against\njailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we\ntrain a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input\nprompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of\nadversarial prompts.

SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience\nby leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's\npotentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails\nof the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only\na negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense\nmethods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend\nagainst malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible\ncompute and latency overhead.

The\nglobal convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not\nencountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to\n(1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network\nkernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks\na spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE\nsystem, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the\ninfinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training\ncases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit).\nThe theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical\nstudies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u9650\u9690\u85cf\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f34\u968f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f34\u968f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u9690\u85cf\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

DSC results indicate limited utility of synthetic data:\ntumor segmentation achieved DSC=0.064 on CT and 0.834 on MRI, while bone\nsegmentation a mean DSC=0.841. Relation between DSC and correlation is\nobserved, but is limited by the complexity of the task. VTT results show\nsynthetic CTs' utility, but with limited educational applications. Synthetic\ndata can be used independently for the segmentation task, although limited by\nthe complexity of the structures to segment.

This encourages the\nemergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are\nnot controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)\nWe then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks\nin MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.\n(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered\nagent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the\nfollowing research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP\nsafety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP\nsafe ecosystem construction.

We introduce an AI-powered method\nfor identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal\nset of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage\nidentification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME),\nefficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically\nterrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require\ntraining data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news\narticles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class\n(such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and\nscales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds\nof events happening globally.

Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic\nspatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints\nof spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial\ncorrelation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed\nSpatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to\nintegrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating\nconstraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two\nspatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the\nlikelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial\ninteractions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the\nlearned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon\nin transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be\nexplicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel\nspatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for\nachieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning.

In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid\nLearner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between\nthe direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand.

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the\nnaive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather\nthe opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action\nas independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and\nmaking typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy.

Drawing on the center-surround\norganization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a\nfrequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of\nfault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic\nspectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory\nsurrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under\nvariable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization\nstrategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field\nparameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing\nfeature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method\nis demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its\nsuitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring\napplications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,\ninspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary\noptimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;\nand (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults\nand their precursors.

This supervision format is highly\npractical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down\nsignals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In\ncontrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which\nare harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory\napproaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical\nperformance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires\napproximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high\noff-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of\nabsolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning\nOptimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing\nthe need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards\nusing a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a\nstraightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary\nmodels and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on\nthe policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO\non scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder\nmodels.

By\nsignificantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict\nhardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and\nCAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its\nunique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal\nPrediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for\ndeploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet\napproaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task\ninto a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The\nHCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer\nbit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal\nwithin a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key\ninnovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides\nstatistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune\nunpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial\ntraining or hardware simulation.

While much research has\nfocused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather,\nthe estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and\nprecipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is\ncurrently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and\nintroduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices,\ndescribing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the\ncorresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We\ndiscuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter\ntemperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and\nsummer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric\ncirculation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the\nreconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields\nimproved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal\nforecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we\nevaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better\nor comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself.

This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation,\nfine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception.\nThese capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models.\nRecently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as\na large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance\ncomparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x\nacceleration in inference speed.\n  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven\nby progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs\nand MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and\nfoundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing\ndomain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete\ndiffusion.

However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D\ndental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.\nDuring the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's\nhead, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward\nprojections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the\nnetwork to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts\nin the reconstructed images. In this study, we propose a computationally\nefficient INR-based reconstruction framework that leverages multi-resolution\nhash encoding for 3D dental CBCT with a truncated FOV. To mitigate truncation\nartifacts, we train the network over an expanded reconstruction domain that\nfully encompasses the patient's head. For computational efficiency, we adopt an\nadaptive training strategy that uses a multi-resolution grid: finer resolution\nlevels and denser sampling inside the truncated FOV, and coarser resolution\nlevels with sparser sampling outside. To maintain consistent input\ndimensionality of the network across spatially varying resolutions, we\nintroduce an adaptive hash encoder that selectively activates the lower-level\nfeatures of the hash hierarchy for points outside the truncated FOV. The\nproposed method with an extended FOV effectively mitigates truncation\nartifacts.

Bringing together\nthe voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI\nsystems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our\ninteractions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving,\nand digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the\nethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine\ninteraction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the\nemerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors\nhighlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance\nlearning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional\nmanipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key\nchallenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding\ndominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for\nindividuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to\nchildren, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may\ninteract with AI in emotionally significant ways.

How can agent developers\ncalibrate the appropriate levels of autonomy at which their agents should\noperate? We argue that an agent's level of autonomy can be treated as a\ndeliberate design decision, separate from its capability and operational\nenvironment. In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy,\ncharacterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent:\noperator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level,\nwe describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open\nquestions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction.

We derive the effective number of bits of radio-frequency analog\ncomputation under thermal noise, quantify the energy--precision trade-off, and\ndemonstrate digital-comparable MNIST accuracy at orders-of-magnitude lower\nenergy, unlocking real-time inference on low-power, memory-free edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIWEN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c04\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u6743\u91cd\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u524d\u7aef\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2dDNN\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2dDNN\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c04\u9891\u8f7d\u6ce2\u7f16\u7801\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u539f\u751f\u6df7\u9891\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u672c\u5730\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u6a21\u6570/\u6570\u6a21\u8f6c\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u70ed\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u91cf\u5316\u5c04\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f4d\u6570\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5f53\u7684MNIST\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MIWEN\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u65e0\u5185\u5b58\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While numerous jailbreak methods\nexist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex\ndecoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method\nthat achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt\nmanipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's\neffectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes.\nWe hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated\nprompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding\nspace visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's\nmodes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index\nMapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining\nsimple decodability.

Part of its\nempirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds,\nminimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to\nunravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit\nregularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework.

Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced\ntechniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This\ngap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of\nmodern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs.\n  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java\nregression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a\nhigh-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework\ndesigned to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99\nregression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub\nrepositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark,\ndemonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we\nempirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing\nboth traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches.

These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated\ndatasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training\nprocess. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack\nspecifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates\nonly the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering\ntheir corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious\nbehaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent\nwill exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is\nintroduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the\ngradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding\nbackdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth\nand enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static\nvisual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We\nevaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM\narchitectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves\nhigh attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high\nclean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation\nstudies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and\nconcealment of the attack.

Each agent transition, memory fragment, and\nreasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain,\nrendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access\nand confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges\ncontextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices.

Reasoning is\nconstrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic\ntraversal of policy-encoded structures.

Recently, clustered federated learning (CFL) has emerged to address this\nchallenge by partitioning users into clusters according to their similarity.\nHowever, CFL faces difficulties in training when users are unwilling to share\ntheir cluster identities due to privacy concerns. To address these issues, we\npresent an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL,\ndubbed EBS-CFL. The proposed EBS-CFL supports effectively training CFL while\nmaintaining users' cluster identity confidentially. Moreover, it detects\npotential poisonous attacks without compromising individual client gradients by\ndiscarding negatively correlated gradients and aggregating positively\ncorrelated ones using a weighted approach. The server also authenticates\ncorrect gradient encoding by clients. EBS-CFL has high efficiency with\nclient-side overhead O(ml + m^2) for communication and O(m^2l) for computation,\nwhere m is the number of cluster identities, and l is the gradient size. When m\n= 1, EBS-CFL's computational efficiency of client is at least O(log n) times\nbetter than comparison schemes, where n is the number of clients.In addition,\nwe validate the scheme through extensive experiments.

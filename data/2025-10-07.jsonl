Plaintiff and defendant agents choose from a constrained action\nspace (for example, discovery requests, motions, meet-and-confer, sanctions)\ngoverned by a JSON rules engine, while a stochastic judge model with calibrated\ngrant rates, cost allocations, and sanction tendencies resolves outcomes. We\ncompare four policies: PPO, a contextual bandit with an LLM, a direct LLM\npolicy, and a hand-crafted heuristic; Instead of optimizing binary case\noutcomes, agents are trained and evaluated using effective win rate and a\ncomposite exploit score that combines opponent-cost inflation, calendar\npressure, settlement pressure at low merit, and a rule-compliance margin.\nAcross configurable regimes (e.g., bankruptcy stays, inter partes review, tax\nprocedures) and heterogeneous judges, we observe emergent ``exploit chains'',\nsuch as cost-inflating discovery sequences and calendar-pressure tactics that\nremain procedurally valid yet systemically harmful. Evaluation via cross-play\nand Bradley-Terry ratings shows, PPO wins more often, the bandit is the most\nconsistently competitive across opponents, the LLM trails them, and the\nheuristic is weakest. The results are stable in judge settings, and the\nsimulation reveals emergent exploit chains, motivating red-teaming of legal\nrule systems in addition to model-level testing."}

The proposed\nsystem enables individual agents to coordinate for demand-side energy\noptimization while improving the user comfort and maintaining the system\nefficiency. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of a slot\nexchange mechanism, where agents first receive optimized appliance-level energy\nconsumption schedules and then coordinate with each other to adjust these\nschedules through slot exchanges.

We identify a critical\ndilemma underpinning this gap: incorporating more RVQ layers improves audio\nreconstruction fidelity but exceeds the generation capacity of conventional\nLMs. To address this, we first analyze RVQ dynamics and uncover two key\nlimitations: 1) orthogonality of features across RVQ layers hinders effective\nLMs training, and 2) descending semantic richness in tokens from deeper RVQ\nlayers exacerbates exposure bias during autoregressive decoding. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Siren, a novel LM-based framework that employs multiple\nisolated transformers with causal conditioning and anti-causal alignment via\nreinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Siren\noutperforms both existing LM-based and diffusion-based T2A systems, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout\nrefinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,\nsubtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing\nslide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate\nthat the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and\ninformative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward\nautomated and ready-to-use academic video generation.

To address this security problem, we exploit a key\nobservation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric\ninformation of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first\nbiometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:\na pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent\nidentity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and\nexpression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit\nidentity swaps as the video is rendered.

In the spirit of syslog, we introduce\nMedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model\nis invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act\nindependently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core\nfields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and\nfeedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To\nencourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the\ndata footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention\npolicies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or\nmulti-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog.

To address these limitations,\nwe introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training\nframework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative\nrefinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of\nmodules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief\nabout the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target\nwith consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the\nbackward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence\neliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements.\nMeanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass,\nmaking SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP.

To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit\ncorpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic\nemotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and\nsynthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight \"probes\" to\nread out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models\nwithout altering their parameters.

We demonstrate\nthat this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early\nand peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable\n(they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the\ninitial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We\ncontribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of\nthe emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing\nmore transparent and aligned AI systems.

To evaluate our\napproach, we introduce the Grounded Ophthalmic Understanding benchmark, which\ncovers six disease categories and three tasks: macro-level diagnostic\nclassification, report generation quality, and fine-grained clinical assessment\nof the generated chain of thought. Experiments show that, with only LoRA\n(Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter Qwen2 backbone, GROK\noutperforms comparable 7B and 32B baselines on both report quality and\nfine-grained clinical metrics, and even exceeds OpenAI o3. Code and data are\npublicly available in the GROK repository."}

Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ\npolygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop\na novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly\ncollected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based\nmodel for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve\n78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong\nperformance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)\nclasses, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class\nimbalance.

A\nd-dimensional embedding is partitioned into S slices, and for each slice, a\nlightweight shared router predicts the top-k experts. Experts operate on their\nassigned slices independently, and outputs are reassembled, maintaining\nper-token FLOP efficiency. Because slices from different tokens interleave\nwithin an expert, utilization is naturally smoother. We propose a slice-level\ncapacity loss, cross-slice dropout, and efficient fused batched GEMM kernels.\nExperiments on WikiText-103 language modeling, WMT En-De translation, and three\ntext-classification datasets show SliceMoE attains up to 1.7x faster inference\nthan dense baselines, 12 to 18 percent lower perplexity than parameter-matched\ntoken-MoE, and improved expert balance, with interpretable expertise over\nsyntactic versus semantic subspaces."}

This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin.

At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and\nsycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect\nmathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the\napplicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed\nproofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing\nbenchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus\nsolely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated\ndatasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that\ncreate ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are\ndemonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first\nbenchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of\nnatural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025\ncompetition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false\nstatements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an\nLLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems\nand find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing\nsycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation\nstrategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on\ncurated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not\neliminate, sycophantic behavior."}

However, some self-interested users may exploit the\nlimitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content\nwith less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such\nbehavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose\n\\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive\nmechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based\ncontract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,\nthereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To\nalleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM\nagents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,\nutilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance\nof LMM agents.

Yet, the crux\nlies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while\nmaintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we\npropose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through\nbatch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation,\nresidual attention, and diversity regularization.

While\nHPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy\nstability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization\nguided by a dual-layer curriculum.

However, empirical evidence shows that\nrepresentations from different modalities occupy completely separate regions of\nembedding space, a phenomenon referred to as the modality gap. Moreover,\nexperimental findings on how the size of the modality gap influences downstream\nperformance are inconsistent. These observations raise two key questions: (1)\nWhat causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To\naddress these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality\nalignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any\nconstraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.\nUnder the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall\ninto two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap\nconverges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result\nidentifies \\emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality\ngap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be\nperfectly aligned under the subspace constraint. The modality gap influences\ndownstream performance by affecting the alignment between sample pairs. We\nprove that, in this case, perfect alignment between two modalities can still be\nachieved via two ways: hyperplane rotation and shared space projection."}

By decoupling the\nbackward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence\neliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements.\nMeanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass,\nmaking SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical\nfoundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with\nnetwork depth. Empirically, SID consistently matches or surpasses the\nclassification accuracy of BP, exhibiting superior scalability and pronounced\nrobustness to label noise.Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/ychAlbert/sid-bp"}

Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,\nsequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face\nsegmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact\nregions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse\nsubset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the\ncomplementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global\nfeature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This\nwork demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving\nchallenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world\napplications."}

In the absence of a process model, offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human\nexpertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard\noffline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever\na learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON\n(Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations.\nOffline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible\nregion spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that\npredicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a\none-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing\ndeviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the\nmanipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a\npolymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and\nbenchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm.\nIn both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average,\nbetter cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in\nthe historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition\noperations beyond current expert capability."}

Previously, we devised an \"enriched\" chart review protocol where a\n\"roadmap\" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values\nin EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a\nmissing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart\nreviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients\nwhose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of\na roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification\nof Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing\nvalues. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap\nfrom our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined\nusing large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to\nexpand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients\nfrom the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm\nperformance with different roadmaps.

Its goal was to assess\nhow well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt\nthrough local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development\nwithout sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to\nclassify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the\nmulti-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:\ngeneralization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after\nfine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear\nprobing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes\n(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and\nExpected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and\nstatistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across\ncenters was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after\nfine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission\nachieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted\nlimitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties\nin hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal\nmodeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.\nConclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for\nevaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification.

However, existing evaluation\nframeworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not\nfirmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce\nC^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.\nC^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:\nconvergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code\ngeneration), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,\nstorytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived\nfrom social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise\n(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source\nmodels, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities. Our results\nhighlight both the strengths and challenges of current FMs in pursuing a\ncreative machine mind, showing that C^2-Eval is an effective lens for examining\nthe evolving landscape of creative AI."}

Fixed-camera video can capture surgical\nworkflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member\nactually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how\ndecisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are\nmade.

EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based\nview enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and\negocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical\ncases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual\nfields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity.

We first study the\nflow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value\ntokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks\nzero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and\nreferring expression detection. We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output!

However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its\nstructure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel\ncontinuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a\ndiscretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this\nformulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local\nintegral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to\na time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational\nperspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the\narchitecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and\nnormalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by\nembedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token\nindices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible\nframework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new\ndirections for architecture design, analysis, and control-based\ninterpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the\ngap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling,\nand contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of\ninterpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models."}

Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically\nunrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model\ntraining as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation\n(WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations.

In contrast, others demonstrate\nthat prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning\nstrategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of\npreviously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach\nsaturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary.

Specifically, a platform based\non the radio show, Just a Minute (JAM), is explored. In this game, players are\nchallenged to speak fluently on a topic for 60 seconds without repeating\nthemselves, hesitating or deviating from the topic. JAM has proposed benefits\nsuch as allowing students to improve their spontaneous speaking skills and\nreduce their use of speech disfluencies (\"um\", \"uh\", etc.).\n  Previous research has highlighted the difficulties students face when\nspeaking publicly, the main one being anxiety. AI Powered Presentation\nPlatforms (AI-PPPs), where students can speak with an immersive AI audience and\nreceive real-time feedback, have been explored as a method to improve student's\nspeaking skills and confidence. So far they have shown promising results which\nthis study aims to build upon.\n  A group of students from the University of York are enlisted to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the JAM platform. They are asked to fill in a questionnaire,\nplay through the game twice and then complete a final questionnaire to discuss\ntheir experiences playing the game. Various statistics are gathered during\ntheir gameplay such as the number of points they gained and the number of rules\nthey broke. The results showed that students found the game promising and\nbelieved that their speaking skills could improve if they played the game for\nlonger. More work will need to be carried out to prove the effectiveness of the\ngame beyond the short term."}

It shows that cross-entropy loss\ndecreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the\nerror-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We\nbelieve it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and\nfuture development of large language models."}

We offer an under-studied perspective by\nexamining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and\nLlama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the\nflow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value\ntokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks\nzero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and\nreferring expression detection. We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output!

We curate a library of over 50 synthetic\nODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that\npre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world\nbenchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and\nhuman ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40%\ncompared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training\non real-world data alone. We demonstrate that this benefit is consistent across\nvarious neural architectures (GRU, Transformer) and provide extensive ablations\nto validate the importance of the curriculum's structure."}

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution.

For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation\nof various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not\nsupport MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent\n(CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover,\nto enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by\nselecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns\nvariable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent\ngenerations.

Our analysis\nreveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298),\nindicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering\nperformance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the\nselection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for\nsteering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we\npropose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which\nmeasures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We\nshow that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52\npercent compared to the current best output score based criterion\n(arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token\nConfidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau\nb approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the\ndivergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering\nfeatures."}

On symbolic tasks, specifically Boolean\ncode problems, clause-aligned FPE systematically reduces polysemanticity\nmetrics and yields higher task accuracy.

LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of\nspecific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important\nresearch area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based\nmethods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by\nNegative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited\nby its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to\nintroduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate\ndomain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting\ntheir generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the\ndistribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution\ninstead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed\n\\textbf{Di}stribution \\textbf{P}reference \\textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO).

A Two-Stage Dynamic View", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves\nsampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,\nresulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate\nthat prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning\nstrategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of\npreviously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach\nsaturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we\nrevisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging\ntraining, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development\nof more advanced reasoning capabilities."}

In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing\na new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data\nwith an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward\nmodel that can distinguish not just what is \\textit{better}, but what is\n\\textit{good enough}. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive\ninference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation\nbudget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our\nexperiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces\nreliability failures by 70\\%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it\nimproves average inference speed by over 22\\% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We\nthus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to\nexplicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational\nefficiency."}

This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel\narchitecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a\ndata-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct\noperational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the\ncurrent query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a\ndedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a\nrepresentation of the complete interaction.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance.

In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights.

This mismatch introduces \"semantic noise\",\ndegrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this\npaper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization\nfor DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns\nheterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We\ninvestigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form\nsolutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness;\nand (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without\nthe need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction\nover AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data\nefficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in\nheterogeneous AI-native wireless networks."}

CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on\nclicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.\nHowever, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a\nsubstantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address\nthis issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While\nthese frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked\nand non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this\nbackground, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels\nfor non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting\nto answer the question, \"Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked\nthe recommended item?\" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual\nInference Multi-task Model (ESCIM).

However, existing\nbenchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus\nsolely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated\ndatasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that\ncreate ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are\ndemonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first\nbenchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of\nnatural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025\ncompetition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false\nstatements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an\nLLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems\nand find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing\nsycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation\nstrategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on\ncurated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not\neliminate, sycophantic behavior."}

This\nmakes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences\nin isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard\nmodels are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the\ndomain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address\nthis, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a\ntransformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core\ncomponents: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the\nlinguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating\nsentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class\nOverlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the\ncoexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the\nmodel explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a\nstrong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable\nimprovements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable\nmethodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the\ncontext of the narrative."}

While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)\nmethods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance\nvaries. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending\npre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent\nrepresentations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty\nrepresentation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against\neight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention\nrecognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and\nuncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action\nlabels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our\nresults show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution\nclassification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based\nOOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more\nefficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain\nMonte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures."}

In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to\nbillions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms\nunderlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses\nthis question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform\nvarious actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \\textit{push red\ncube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the\nactive inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling\ncuriosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several\nnontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise\nsubstantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler,\nprerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex\nactions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of\nsentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional\ngeneralization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of\ncompositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible\nmechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and\nprovide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology."}

While recent\nstudies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such\ntasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative\ncapacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as\ninstructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired\nby the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general\nThink-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an\nembedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain\ncomplex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations\nconditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This\nexplicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex\nmultimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging\na powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the\nMMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house\ndatasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune\na smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces,\nachieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain\nover recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating\nthe reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without\nsacrificing performance."}

Using string diagrammatical tools, we can\nexplicitly describe the graphs that serve as consistent abstractions of a\nlow-level graph under interventions.

To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual\nlearning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human\nmotion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,\nserves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.\nAn efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT\noutputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further\nfacilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object\ntracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that\nencourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a\ncurriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training.

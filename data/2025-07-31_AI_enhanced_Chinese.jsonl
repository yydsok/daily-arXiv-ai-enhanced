This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization.

We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced\nsteering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a\ndistinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design\napproaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of\nfreedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient\nmovement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex\nterrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between\ndifferent locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and\noptimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's\nmechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)\ncontroller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward\nstructure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework\nenables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that\nfacilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.\nFurthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel\nand highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic\nadvantages of both locomotion modes.

In this chapter, a a\nsoil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in\norder to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust\nautonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended\nto incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade\nthrough the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately\ntracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a\nflat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of\ncutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building\nupon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to\nextract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,\nand an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to\npredict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a\ncompact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to\ntrain the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the\nmapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in\nthe map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner.

Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models\nrely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration\nmodels for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction\nframework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with\ngiven text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise\nprediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline\nmodels. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment\naccuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the\nmismatch between prompt audio and input audio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u65f6\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52TTS\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52TTS\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u65f6\u957f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65f6\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u65f6\u957f\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea611.3%\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cTTS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86TTS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}.

Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities.

This development happens in parallel with a growing demand\nof data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient\noptimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously\nestablished as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In\nparallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an\nobjective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level.

AR models, which\nrely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow\ngeneration speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)\ncaching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel\ntext-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching.

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and\nhigh-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our\nmethod suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals.

Jakab and F. Kofler have shared last authorship", "summary": "Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,\nencompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and\noutcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and\nCC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings\nsupport the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance\nvolumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u513f\u7ae5\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u548cT2\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u589e\u5f3a\u80bf\u7624\u548c\u56ca\u6027\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5272\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u513f\u7ae5\u8111\u80bf\u7624\uff08PBTs\uff09\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027PBT\u4e9a\u578b\u548cMRI\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528174\u540d\u513f\u7ae5\u60a3\u8005\u7684MRI\u6570\u636e\uff08T1\u3001T1-C\u3001T2\u3001FLAIR\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec33D nnU-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u80bf\u7624\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u548cT2\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff08DSC: 0.85\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u76f8\u5f53\uff08DSC: 0.86\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u80bf\u7624\u548c\u56ca\u6027\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5272\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6574\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u548cT2\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u589e\u5f3a\u80bf\u7624\u548c\u56ca\u6027\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316MRI\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

To ensure holistic and fair\nevaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores\n``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \\textit{three}\nmodalities (video, audio, and text), \\textit{six} responses per candidate, and\n\\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs\nmodality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and\nsubsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module\ncompresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating\nefficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate\na two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads\npredict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across\nresponses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five\ntarget dimensions.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future\nwork involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and\noptimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training\nhyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528Normalizing Flows\uff08NF\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u573a\u666f\u53c2\u6570\u7684PDF\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfKDE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cNF\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u66f4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u53c2\u6570\u7684PDF\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u9650\u5236\u6216\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Normalizing Flows\uff08NF\uff09\u8fdb\u884cPDF\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0cNF\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9PDF\u5f62\u72b6\u505a\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "NF\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eKDE\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u66f4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "NF\u5728\u573a\u666f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4f18\u5316NF\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

More\nprototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the\nactivation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn\nrich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer\nsupport for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6784\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u529f\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6027\u7684\u6784\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790Pythia-1.4B\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u53cc\u5bbe\u8bed\u548c\u4ecb\u8bcd\u5bbe\u8bed\u6784\u5f0f\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285000\u5bf9\u53e5\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u80fd\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cJensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u53d7\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u66f4\u5178\u578b\u7684\u6784\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u66f4\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6784\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6784\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

Motivated by this ability, this paper\nintroduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face\nrecognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized\ncategory discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled\nknown identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen\nIDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high\ncardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD\napproaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method\nthat dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using\nlightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a\nHyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned\non each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle\nidentity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms\nexisting GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face\nrecognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u4eba\u8138\u53d1\u73b0\uff08GFD\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\uff08GCD\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FaceGCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u5de5\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\uff08AGI\uff09\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFaceGCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5c42\u524d\u7f00\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HyperNetwork\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u524d\u7f00\u3002", "result": "FaceGCD\u5728GFD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cArcFace\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "FaceGCD\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions.

Reasoning! Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.PL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz.

Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,\nduring cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous\nstudies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual\ncomparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory\ndistortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying\nwhat visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel\nresearch question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates\nnaturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions\nto elicit similarity-induced memory biases.

A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution\nusing the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of\ngenerative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent\nstochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their\neffectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty.

By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling\nmultiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose\npixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies.

Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks.

Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item\nassociations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or\nleveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook\ncritical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to\nthe long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose\nMMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning\nframework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three\nmain components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that\nleverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a\nself-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and\nlearns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation\naggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic\nand task levels.

However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant\non historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,\noptimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.\nThis log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical\npreferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a\nresult, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately\nharming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole\nrecommendation ecosystem.\n  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of\nrecommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places\nuser intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,\nand explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into\nan intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the\nabove domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a\nmulti-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced\npre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative\njudge system.

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework\nintegrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to\nextract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of\nExperts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to\ndifferent visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the\nvisual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a\nHierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and\nan adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features.

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions.

A commonly used model\nassumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with\na shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for\nestimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information\nacross datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they\nhave not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which\nis of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and\ndimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty\nabout which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their\npotential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the\nasymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop\noptimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals\nthat while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,\noptimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend\nour analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical\nalgorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical\nguidance for method selection in practical data integration problems.

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality.

Here, we introduce a novel\nphysics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model\n(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor\nof up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM\nis trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and\nconditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard\nconservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of\nSMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust\ngeneralization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,\nour constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE\nfor the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming\ninterpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,\nwe demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial\nscales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System\nModel as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to\ndirectly downscale ESM fields.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line.

While the field has seen extensive methodological development,\nits theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing\ntheoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target\ndomains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to\nmeasures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not\nfully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a\nshared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain\nalignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature\ntransformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first\nderive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers\nof the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize\nthe sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous\nanalysis of the covering numbers of these architectures.

Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a\ndomain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable\nof ethic-based negotiating.

To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation.

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,\ncompared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\\% to\n48.29\\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\\% to 53.28\\%, and test coverage\nby 0.78\\% to 53.96\\%.

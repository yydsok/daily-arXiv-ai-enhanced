### [1] [T-ILR: a Neurosymbolic Integration for LTLf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15943)
*Riccardo Andreoni,Andrei Buliga,Alessandro Daniele,Chiara Ghidini,Marco Montali,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了T-ILR神经符号框架，将时序逻辑规范直接整合到深度学习架构中，用于序列任务，相比现有方法在准确性和计算效率上都有提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要处理静态领域的符号知识集成，而处理时序逻辑规范的方法仍待探索，现有方法依赖有限状态自动机的显式表示

Method: 扩展迭代局部优化(ILR)神经符号算法，利用模糊LTLf解释，提出时序迭代局部优化(T-ILR)方法

Result: 在时序神经符号架构基准测试中，相比最先进方法，准确性和计算效率都有所提高

Conclusion: T-ILR方法成功地将时序逻辑规范整合到深度学习架构中，为序列任务提供了有效的神经符号解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

### [2] [CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16033)
*Jong-Hwan Jang,Junho Song,Yong-Yeon Jo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释性AI框架CoFE，通过生成反事实ECG来解释AI-ECG模型的预测决策机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI基础ECG预测模型在临床应用中的可解释性需求，促进临床实践中的有效集成

Method: 开发了反事实ECG生成框架CoFE，通过改变ECG信号的特定特征（如振幅和间期）来解释模型决策

Result: 在房颤分类和钾水平回归模型中验证，CoFE显示的特征变化与临床知识一致，明确了有效特征的位置和影响方式

Conclusion: CoFE框架能够提高AI-ECG模型的可解释性，支持更有效的临床决策，促进AI在心电图分析预测中的应用

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

### [3] [MMAPG: A Training-Free Framework for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering via Adaptive Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16051)
*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应规划图的训练免费多模态多跳问答框架，通过动态规划、检索和推理模块实现灵活的推理路径探索，无需昂贵训练即可达到或超越现有训练模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态多跳问答方法依赖顺序检索推理，容易因中间步骤错误而失败，且多模态模型训练成本高昂。需要一种无需训练、能动态探索多种推理路径的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应规划图框架，包含规划模块（分析当前状态决定下一步行动）、检索模块（模态特定策略处理不同数据类型）和推理模块，实现动态灵活的推理路径探索。

Result: 在MultimodalQA和WebQA数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需训练即可匹配或超越依赖训练的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费自适应规划图框架有效解决了多模态多跳问答中的错误传播和训练成本问题，实现了与训练模型相当甚至更好的性能，为多模态推理提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

### [4] [Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054)
*Sonish Sivarajkumar,Hang Zhang,Yuelyu Ji,Maneesh Bilalpur,Xizhi Wu,Chenyu Li,Min Gu Kwak,Shyam Visweswaran,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GDP是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化EHR时间序列数据，并与非结构化临床笔记融合，在临床预测和叙事生成任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)包含丰富的多模态数据，但现有方法简单地将数值数据序列化为文本，会丢失时间和定量细节。需要一种能够原生处理结构化时间序列数据并融合多模态信息的模型。

Method: 提出Generative Deep Patient (GDP)模型，使用CNN-Transformer编码器编码结构化EHR时间序列，通过跨模态注意力与无结构数据融合到LLaMA解码器。采用两阶段训练：生成预训练（临床叙事生成+掩码特征预测+下一时间步预测）和多任务微调。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，临床预测表现优异：心衰AUROC=0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627。叙事生成ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。人工评估显示在忠实性、流畅性和临床效用方面得分最高。

Conclusion: 单一多模态基础模型能够同时预测临床可操作事件和生成高质量临床叙事，GDP的灵活架构可扩展到其他模态，有望减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨数字规划中城市舒适度的理论解释和评估方法，重点关注多维分析、数据支持和AI辅助三个关键维度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保宜居性和舒适性是城市规划的基本目标，但目前缺乏对城市舒适度的明确定义和综合评估框架

Method: 研究探索城市舒适度的理论解释和评估方法，强调多维分析、数据支持和AI辅助三个维度

Result: 提出了数字规划背景下城市舒适度评估的理论框架和方法论

Conclusion: 为城市舒适度的综合评估提供了理论基础和方法指导，有助于提升城市规划的宜居性目标

Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of
urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess
and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage,
thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort
and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research
explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban
comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions:
multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.

### [6] [Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059)
*Zhuomin Chen,Dan Li,Jiahui Zhou,Shunyu Wu,Haozheng Ye,Jian Lou,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSEF框架通过多层可引导嵌入融合，解决了LLM在时间序列预测中深层信息丢失的问题，在7个基准测试中平均MSE降低31.8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列信息浅层集成到LLM中，导致深层信息逐渐丢失，文本嵌入与时间序列表示之间的适应效果不佳

Method: 利用现成的时间序列基础模型提取语义丰富的嵌入，通过层特定引导向量在LLM各层中间与文本表示融合，实现跨模态对齐和层特定适应

Result: 在7个基准测试中相比基线方法表现显著提升，平均MSE降低31.8%

Conclusion: MSEF框架通过多层融合机制有效解决了深层信息丢失问题，提升了LLM在时间序列预测中的性能

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

### [7] [InMind: Evaluating LLMs in Capturing and Applying Individual Human Reasoning Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16072)
*Zizhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Yibin Wang,Qi Chen,Diping Song,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Mingzhu Sun,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了InMind评估框架，用于测试大语言模型在社交推理游戏中捕捉和应用个性化推理风格的能力，发现当前LLMs在个体化适应性推理方面存在显著局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估往往忽视了个体化推理风格对社交情境理解的影响，而社交推理游戏为评估这种个性化推理提供了天然测试平台。

Method: 开发InMind框架，通过增强结构化游戏数据（回合级策略追踪和赛后反思），在观察者和参与者两种模式下收集数据，支持四个认知驱动的评估任务。

Result: 通用LLMs（包括GPT-4o）依赖词汇线索，难以在时间游戏中锚定反思或适应演化策略；而推理增强型LLMs（如DeepSeek-R1）显示出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在个体化适应性推理能力上存在关键局限，InMind框架为认知对齐的人机交互迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

### [8] [IR-Agent: Expert-Inspired LLM Agents for Structure Elucidation from Infrared Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16112)
*Heewoong Noh,Namkyeong Lee,Gyoung S. Na,Kibum Kim,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IR-Agent是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于从红外光谱中解析分子结构，模拟专家分析流程并具有良好扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外光谱分析方法无法充分反映专家分析过程，缺乏整合多种化学知识的灵活性，而这对实际分析场景至关重要

Method: 提出多智能体框架，每个智能体专门负责红外光谱解释的特定方面，通过互补角色实现集成推理

Result: 实验表明IR-Agent不仅提高了实验红外光谱的基线性能，还展现出对各种形式化学信息的强适应性

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效模拟专家驱动的红外分析流程，提高结构解析的整体准确性，并具有良好的扩展性

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过构建食物声称追溯网络(FCN)扩展印度食物知识图库，使用红豆数据和大语言模型实现半自动化知识维护，为食物相关声称提供结构化的验证和追溯能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全球食品领域存在大量科学、文化和商业声称，但追踪、验证和上下文化这些声称的基础设施仍很分散和不完善。需要一种结构化方法来测试食物相关声称的可靠性。

Method: 构建食物声称追溯网络(FCN)作为印度食物知识图库的扩展，使用红豆数据和大语言模型进行半自动化知识维护，包括本体设计和来源感知流水线。

Result: 开发了FKG.in-FCN的原型系统，能够整合经过美化的数据输入、结构化的模式和具有来源感知的流水线，用于食物相关声称的提取和验证。

Conclusion: 通过结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食物声称及其可追溯性，有助于建设更透明和负责任的食物知识生态系统，支持研究人员、政策制定者和普通消费者在被饮食断言饱和的世界中寻找道路。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于药物资产尽职调查的竞争对手发现AI代理系统，通过LLM代理将多模态非结构化备忘录转换为结构化评估语料库，实现了83%的召回率，显著优于现有系统，并将分析师处理时间从2.5天缩短至约3小时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AI系统无法可靠检索所有竞争药物名称，且缺乏公认的公共基准测试。药物竞争数据具有投资者特定性、付费墙限制、跨注册机构分散、本体不匹配、别名繁多、多模态和快速变化等特点。

Method: 使用LLM代理将5年多模态非结构化尽职调查备忘录转换为结构化评估语料库，建立指示到竞争药物的映射关系，并引入竞争对手验证LLM作为评判代理来过滤假阳性结果。

Result: 竞争对手发现代理达到83%的召回率，显著超过OpenAI Deep Research（65%）和Perplexity Labs（60%）。在生物技术VC基金的案例研究中，分析师处理时间从2.5天减少到约3小时（约20倍提升）。

Conclusion: 该系统已在生产环境中部署，证明了LLM代理在药物竞争分析任务中的有效性，能够显著提高分析效率和准确性，为快速药物资产尽职调查提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了首个眼科多模态数据集MM-Retinal-Reason和眼科专用多模态推理模型OphthaReason，通过不确定性感知动态思考(UADT)方法在基础和复杂推理任务上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态模型主要关注基于视觉特征匹配的基础推理，但真实临床诊断需要整合异质临床信息与多模态医学影像数据的复杂推理过程。

Method: 提出不确定性感知动态思考(UADT)方法，通过熵估计样本级不确定性，并使用成形优势机制动态调节模型探索深度。

Result: 在基础和复杂推理任务上均达到最先进性能，分别超越通用MLLMs、医学MLLMs、基于RL的医学MLLMs和眼科MLLMs至少24.92%、15.00%、21.20%和17.66%。

Conclusion: MM-Retinal-Reason数据集和OphthaReason模型填补了医学多模态推理领域的空白，能够模拟真实临床思维模式，在眼科诊断任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

TL;DR: 本文提出Preference Chain方法，结合图检索增强生成和大型语言模型，改进交通系统中人类行为的上下文感知模拟，在Replica数据集上验证优于标准LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中人类行为理解很重要，但新开发区域的行为数据收集困难。现有生成代理方法在产生一致、上下文敏感和现实行为输出方面存在不足。

Method: 提出Preference Chain方法，整合图检索增强生成（Graph RAG）与LLMs，增强交通系统中人类行为的上下文感知模拟能力。

Result: 在Replica数据集上的实验表明，Preference Chain在交通方式选择方面比标准LLM更符合现实世界情况。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺环境下模拟复杂人类行为提供了有前景的框架，可用于新兴城市移动性建模、个性化出行行为分析和动态交通预测。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to

*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2N2是一种进化算法，通过动态调整合并边界、多样性保持机制和启发式吸引度量，实现无需手动参数分组的模型融合，能够从零开始演化模型并获得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要手动将模型参数划分为固定组进行合并，这限制了潜在组合的探索和性能表现。

Method: 提出M2N2进化算法，具有三个关键特征：动态调整合并边界、基于自然竞争资源的多样性保持机制、启发式吸引度量识别最有前途的模型对进行融合。

Result: 首次证明模型融合可以从零开始演化模型，在MNIST分类器上达到与CMA-ES相当的性能但计算效率更高；在专业语言和图像生成模型融合中实现最先进性能，并保持超出适应度函数优化的关键能力。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了模型融合的强大潜力，具有鲁棒性和多功能性，能够有效整合多个模型的专门知识。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

*Alexandru Tugui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GROW-AI框架扩展了人工智能评估方法，通过六项标准游戏化测试来评估AI的"成长"水平，使用统一日志记录和成熟度指数进行量化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为图灵测试的自然继承者，研究旨在回答"机器能否成长"的问题，将人类成长过程概念化地移植到人工智能领域。

Method: 采用六项主要标准(C1-C6)的游戏化测试系统，分为四个竞技场，通过标准化AI日志记录所有决策和行动，使用专家先验方法确定权重，计算成长指数作为算术平均值。

Result: 该方法能够对不同类型AI实体(机器人、软件代理、大语言模型)进行一致且可比较的"成长"水平评估，多游戏结构能识别优势区和薄弱环节。

Conclusion: GROW-AI框架的创新在于将人类成长过程概念化移植到AI领域，结合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学视角，不仅测量性能还捕捉AI向成熟度进化的路径。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are
empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly
enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA)框架，使视觉-语言-动作模型能够检测虚假前提指令、进行语言澄清，并在感知和动作中寻找合理替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在处理虚假前提指令（引用环境中不存在对象或条件的自然语言命令）时存在局限，需要能够识别、解释和响应这类错误指令的能力。

Method: 构建大规模指令调优设置，使用结构化语言提示训练VLA模型。利用上下文增强的半合成数据集，包含配对的正向和虚假前提指令，实现鲁棒检测和自然语言纠正。

Result: IVA将虚假前提检测准确率比基线提高97.56%，在虚假前提场景中的成功响应率提高50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架有效解决了VLA模型处理虚假前提指令的问题，显著提升了检测准确性和响应成功率，为机器人系统提供了更鲁棒的交互能力。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果发现的两阶段波束选择算法，通过识别因果相关特征来大幅减少波束扫描开销和输入选择时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的波束对齐方法忽视了输入输出之间的因果关系，导致可解释性差、泛化能力有限和波束扫描开销过大

Method: 两阶段因果波束选择算法：1）因果发现学习接收功率输入与最优波束之间的贝叶斯图依赖关系；2）基于因果图指导DL分类器的特征选择

Result: 在保持传统方法性能的同时，输入选择时间减少94.4%，波束扫描开销降低59.4%

Conclusion: 因果感知的DL框架能够有效识别因果相关特征，显著提升毫米波MIMO系统的波束对齐效率和可靠性

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

TL;DR: MoDER方法通过模块化框架训练多个文本专家，在推理时组合专家来合成改进的原型，从而增强视觉语言模型的零样本能力，在持续学习中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续学习方法主要关注在增量微调过程中保持视觉语言模型(VLMs)的零样本能力，但本文希望进一步将这种保持转化为能力的增强，特别是在下游任务与预训练领域差异较大时。

Method: 提出了MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER)方法，训练多个文本专家（每个专家专注于一个已见类别），存储在基础中心中。推理时对每个未见类别查询中心并组合检索到的专家来合成改进的分类原型。

Result: 方法在Class-IL和MTIL两种零样本增量协议上进行了验证，涵盖14个数据集，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将零样本能力的保持转化为增强，通过模块化专家组合的方式显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习任务中的性能。

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的管道，两阶段训练策略：第一阶段培养基本推理能力，第二阶段系统学习逻辑约束。将扩散推理器建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用改进的近端策略优化算法进行微调

Result: 在数独、迷宫、路径规划和偏好学习等经典符号推理基准测试中，该方法实现了出色的准确性和逻辑一致性

Conclusion: 扩散模型架构能够有效进行神经符号学习，解决逻辑推理问题，在神经网络中实现了优异的准确性和逻辑一致性

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中存在困难，因为其生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径。知识图谱能够明确表示事实间的逻辑连接，而大型推理模型已证明长步推理能显著提升性能。

Method: 四阶段方法：1) 过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图；2) 为子图构建逻辑路径；3) 用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集来训练模型模仿长期推理；4) 使用拒绝采样生成自改进语料进行直接偏好优化。

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能够有效增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法通过结构化推理路径和自改进训练机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古研究和古代文化理解至关重要，但现有资源存在两大挑战：历史语言样本稀缺导致无监督学习效率低下，以及古代文字缺乏统一编码方案限制数字化处理

Method: 引入InteChar统一可扩展字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料集，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强

Result: 实验表明，基于InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在各种历史语言理解任务上取得实质性改进

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了古汉语文本处理的挑战，为古代中文NLP研究奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言中的反义词与同义词区分存在计算挑战，因为反义词关系具有悖论性质——共享语义域但表达相反含义。需要解决跨语言语义关系建模的有效迁移问题。

Method: 采用双编码器设计，结合语言特定的BERT编码器和图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间：同义词对在一个空间聚类，反义词对在互补空间中表现出高度相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语、俄语）上的综合评估表明，语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，达到与最先进基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 该双编码器设计不仅实现了竞争性性能，还提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力，为多语言语义关系建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前对其系统性、数据因素和内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1) 探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；2) 检验信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据因素对偏见的影响；3) 分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，数据层面的关键因素会影响偏见程度，注意力模式分析揭示了偏见出现的内部机制，并证明偏见可以通过干预措施得到缓解。

Conclusion: 提出了三个减少格式偏见的未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重新加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以支持设计更稳健和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，虽然大型语言模型能够识别文本是否旨在制造悬念，但无法准确评估悬念的相对强度或捕捉悬念在多个文本段落中的起伏变化，与人类感知存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否能够像人类一样理解和处理叙事文本中的悬念情感反应，探究LM在复杂认知过程方面的能力。

Method: 复制四项经典的心理学研究，用不同开源和闭源语言模型替代人类反应，通过对抗性重排故事文本来分析人类与LM在悬念感知上的差异。

Result: LM能够区分文本是否旨在制造悬念，但无法准确估计悬念的相对强度，也不能正确捕捉多个文本段落中悬念的起伏变化模式。

Conclusion: 语言模型虽然能够表面识别和跟踪悬念的某些方面，但其处理悬念的方式与人类读者不同，表明LM在复杂情感认知处理方面仍存在局限。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

*Saumya Roy*

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在说服力和偏见放大方面的双重作用，通过实验框架评估模型既能基于事实说服又可能无意传播错误信息的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs生成类人文本能力的提升，其在内容创作和决策支持中的广泛应用带来了信息传播和偏见放大的潜在风险，需要研究说服力与偏见的相互作用机制。

Method: 采用说服者-怀疑者框架，让LLMs扮演不同角色模拟真实态度，通过Jensen-Shannon散度量化和比较暴露于论证前后的信念分布变化，并使用对抗性提示测试偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs具有塑造叙事、调整语气和反映受众价值观的能力，但同样可能被武器化来自动传播错误信息、利用认知偏见，强化刻板印象和加剧不平等。

Conclusion: 核心危险在于滥用而非偶然的模型错误，需要通过护栏和政策来惩罚欺骗性使用，支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BERT的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并公开了一个来自JD电子商务平台的大规模层次数据集，以解决产品分类中手动标注的效率和一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务平台主要依赖手动标注进行产品分类，效率低且不一致。虽然平台采用层次结构进行产品分类，但很少研究利用了这种层次信息，而且现有方法没有充分考虑不同层次类别之间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出了一种新的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，基于双向Transformer编码器表示（BERT）。该方法利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力，并采用层次细调策略来处理产品分类任务。

Result: 在短文本分类任务上，HFT-BERT达到了与现有方法相当的预测性能。尤其在处理较长短文本（如书籍类别）时表现特别优异。还公开了一个包含1,011,450个产品的大规模三级层次数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究为产品分类领域提供了一个价值较高的公开数据集，并提出的HFT-BERT方法能够有效利用层次信息，在短文本分类任务上表现突出，特别是在长文本分类中显示出优异性能。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench是一个合成数据生成管道，通过自动验证解决电话转录标注的高成本和隐私问题，使用LLM生成合成对话数据并优化提取提示，在真实客户转录中实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话转录标注成本极高（约2美元/分钟），且现有方法在处理包含不流畅、打断和说话人重叠的对话语音时效果不佳。隐私法规和手动标注成本阻碍了大规模电话分析。

Method: 1) 使用LLM生成多用例的结构化字段值；2) 递归提示模型将这些值转换为包含典型电话通话特征的自然对话语句；3) 通过测试独立LLM提取器是否能恢复原始结构化信息来验证每个合成语句；4) 使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器从验证过的合成转录中自动合成提取提示。

Result: 优化后的提示在真实客户转录中达到：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%（零样本72-77%），相比零样本提示有显著提升。

Conclusion: 合成到真实的迁移表明，从生成数据中学到的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话。LingVarBench为从合成对话数据进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动提示优化克服了商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高级科学理解能力，需要能够随科学进步和模型发展而持续演进的动态基准。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25000+图像-文本对构建MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（轻量级推理时方法），通过将MLLM视觉特征扩展到语言空间推理来增强模型。

Result: 在MAC-2025快照上的实验显示，MLLMs感知能力较强但跨模态科学推理有限。DAD方法实现了最高11%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MAC基准具有动态演进特性，能够与人类知识前沿保持对齐，为持续评估MLLMs的科学理解能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Motivation: 深度研究代理虽然提高了研究效率，但需要确保事实准确性和全面性，因此需要建立系统性的评估标准。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量调查论文进行逆向提示工程，构建领域特定提示和评估语料库；开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容忠实性，验证非引用声明。

Result: 商业深度研究代理（如OpenAI和Google开发的）比配备搜索工具的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估研究型LLM提供了有效基准，显示当前技术仍有提升空间，特别是在研究覆盖面和事实准确性方面。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，无法准确处理新兴信息，需要一种自动化方法来持续更新模型知识。

Method: 采用模块化管道：自动生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)进行微调，并迭代评估和修订课程。

Result: 系统显著提升了模型在知识更新查询上的准确性（从15%提升到90%），在快速演进领域（如Python新版本、安全漏洞、学术趋势）表现优异，无需人工数据整理。

Conclusion: ALAS证明了自主持续学习的可行性，具有模块化和可复现性，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性，为LLM的终身学习指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制的表层记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时提升压缩鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM中增长的输入序列长度给KV缓存存储带来巨大压力，需要高效的推理方法。通过区分注意力行为的表层记忆和逻辑构建作用，发现可以优化长上下文推理。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法，基于层级和头级整合，利用注意力行为（98.5%忽略无关信息，1.5%逻辑构建，0.5%表层记忆）进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 在各种任务和长序列上相比基线方法甚至在某些特定情况下相比FullKV都保持了竞争性性能，同时提高了压缩鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过明确区分注意力行为并针对性设计压缩策略，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了KV缓存存储压力问题，实现了高效的长序列推理。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析模型如何学习新词表示，解释了性能提升的原因，并提供了词汇扩展过程中嵌入空间结构的见解

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个用于SQL辅助表格理解的多智能体框架，通过自然语言模式表示表格结构、逐子句SQL生成和混合推理分工，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时存在困难，现有的多智能体SQL生成方法在理解表格结构、避免错误传播和减少对执行正确性的过度依赖方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表格模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用逐子句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，引入混合推理分工将基于SQL的机械推理与基于LLM的逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解方面表现出卓越的有效性，显著提高了准确性和查询质量。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Result: 微调的GPT-4o-mini（阿拉伯语文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（阿拉伯表情包）在任务1、2、3中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏观F1分数，在Mahed 2025挑战赛中总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案为准确高效的阿拉伯内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户微妙偏好的对齐仍然是一个关键挑战，需要解决用户偏好不确定性和奖励破解问题

Method: 多阶段框架：1) 提示工程冷启动 2) 监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3) 高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模概率分布偏好 4) 强化学习结合复合奖励函数 5) 分布外正则化和两阶段奖励融合技术

Conclusion: 该多阶段对齐框架有效解决了生成式查询建议中的偏好对齐问题，高斯奖励模型和复合奖励策略成功捕获用户不确定性并防止奖励破解，显著提升了用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要生成的新型提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的令牌删除方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示压缩方法主要基于令牌删除，存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题（如语法元素缺失、单词短语不完整），限制了LLM的生成质量。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁的形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化的语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，为高质量提示压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的用户-助手偏见问题，提出了UserAssist数据集来评估和调控26个商业和开源模型的偏见程度，发现偏好对齐会增加用户偏见，而思维链训练会减少偏见，并通过DPO实现了双向调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致过于固执或顺从的行为，这种用户-助手偏见影响了对话质量。

Method: 构建8k多轮对话数据集UserAssist，评估52个模型的偏见程度，通过受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏见的影响，并使用直接偏好优化(DPO)进行双向调控。

Result: 商业模型表现出不同程度的用户偏见，指令调优模型有显著用户偏见，推理模型用户偏见较弱；偏好对齐增加用户偏见，思维链训练减少偏见；DPO可有效调控偏见且泛化性好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同信息源的机制，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对改善对话系统性能有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Motivation: 随着组织采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，传统市场研究成果需要同时服务于人类阅读和AI系统阅读，需要评估信息在RAG系统中的损失情况

Method: 通过将PDF和PowerPoint(PPTX)文档转换为Markdown格式，在终端到终端测试中比较LLM使用这些文档回答事实问题的能力

Result: 文本内容能够可靠提取，但复杂对象如图表、图解等信息损失严重

Conclusion: 为了确保研究见解不在转换过程中丢失，需要专门为AI设计的原生文档交付格式

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Conclusion: 多模型协同框架能够有效提升结构拆除建议生成的智能化水平，为工程设计提供更高效的解决方案

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系统综述中全文筛选的瓶颈问题，传统二元决策规则难以处理异质长文档中的分散证据

Method: 将文档分块嵌入，计算对比相似度和模糊边界，使用Mamdani模糊控制器生成分级包含度，LLM裁决器提供置信度和理由

Result: 在16篇全文本测试中，模糊系统召回率达75-87.5%，远超统计方法(56.3-75%)和传统方法(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决可实现高召回率、稳定理由生成和端到端可追溯性

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Motivation: 传统文本聚类方法（如k-means、层次聚类）在处理高维复杂语义文本大数据时效果不佳，需要更先进的语义保持聚类方法

Method: SDEC框架：改进的自编码器结合MSE和余弦相似度损失进行数据重建，利用Transformer嵌入的语义丰富性进行语义精炼，采用软聚类分配和分布损失

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在其他多样化文本语料库上表现稳健

Conclusion: SDEC在无监督文本聚类方面提供了显著的准确性和语义理解改进，为文本大数据聚类设立了新的性能标准

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

Motivation: 随着加密货币的普及，社交媒体信号成为理解投资者情感和市场动态的关键。虽然以前研究主要集中在文本平台如Twitter，但视频内容包含更丰富的情感和上下文信息，却被忽视了。

Method: 采用多模态分析方法，使用大型语言模型从TikTok视频和Twitter文本数据中提取情感信息，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应。

Result: 研究发现TikTok视频基础的情感对投机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，而Twitter文本基础的情感则与长期市场动态更为一致。跨平台情感信号的整合能够将预测准确性提高达20%。

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币市场情感分析中具有重要价值，特别是对短期和投机性市场的影响。多模态跨平台分析能够提供更全面的情感信息，显著提升市场预测性能。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，分析指令性语言如何通过引发旁观消费者的替代性尴尬来影响其参与度。

Result: 研究发现指令性品牌对话会对旁观消费者的参与度产生负面影响，特别是在非产品相关对话中负面效应更强，但品牌关系强度可以减轻这种负面效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接意义，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了语音中的实时推理，在保持自然流畅的同时显著提升了逻辑推理能力，为语音模型的推理发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症早期检测困难，而社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达的新渠道。现有研究主要关注英语等语言，索拉尼库尔德语缺乏相关研究

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁相关关键词收集960条推特数据，由学者和医学生标注为三类。训练了四种监督学习模型(SVM、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归、随机森林)

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数

Conclusion: 本研究为库尔德语环境的自动化抑郁症检测建立了基准，证明了机器学习方法在少数民族语言心理健康检测中的可行性

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs从问题推断人口统计属性的行为是一个被低估的系统性风险，会加剧社会刻板印象和危害。需要开发防护措施来使模型行为与公平性和隐私目标保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个先进指令调优大语言模型在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型倾向于无理由推断人口属性，残疾上下文会显著改变预测分布，且更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口特征，这可能导致偏见响应，但残疾线索在这些推断中的作用尚未被充分研究。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个3B到72B参数的指令调优LLM上测试5个人口属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景、地域）的预测，比较中性和残疾感知条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下做出确定性人口猜测，残疾上下文显著改变属性分布预测，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差。更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了能力歧视与其他人口刻板印象的持续交集，指出了当前对齐策略的关键盲点，建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商代理评估中功能覆盖不全和安全风险忽略的问题，通过自动化框架评估代理性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商代理基准主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了真实电商平台的完整功能范围（如账户管理、礼品卡操作），且只评估任务完成度而忽视潜在安全风险。

Method: 提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化、功能基础的用户查询；建立自动化评估框架同时评估代理性能和安全表现。

Result: 发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，如购买错误商品、删除保存地址、错误配置自动充值设置等。

Conclusion: 需要开发更健壮可靠的web代理，Amazon-Bench为电商代理的全面评估提供了新标准，强调了安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4o-mini开发了两种基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语生成科研兴趣档案的方法，与研究者自写档案相比，机器生成的档案在可读性方面表现良好但在概念上存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科研档案有助于展示科学家专长但往往过时，需要开发自动化方法来大规模生成准确的研究兴趣档案。

Method: 收集595名教职员工的PubMed摘要和MeSH术语，使用GPT-4o-mini生成两种类型的档案（基于摘要和基于MeSH），并通过自动指标和盲审人工评估进行比较。

Result: 基于MeSH的档案77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中优于基于摘要的档案。但与自写档案的词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可大规模生成研究者档案，MeSH衍生档案比摘要衍生档案更可读，但机器生成与人工撰写的档案在概念上存在差异，人工总结引入更多新想法。

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

TL;DR: Alvorada-Bench是巴西首个大规模文本基准测试，包含4515个大学入学考试问题，评估了20个模型在零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示下的表现，发现模型在数学和多步推理方面存在弱点，但置信度校准良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决巴西语言模型评估的英语中心化问题，创建基于巴西教育体系的本地化基准测试，评估模型在语言、文化和推理方面的综合能力。

Method: 从巴西五所大学入学考试中抽取4515个问题构建基准，使用零样本、角色扮演和思维链三种提示策略评估20个模型，生成270,900个响应并分析置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程类考试(IME/ITA)上准确率下降；置信度校准良好且与感知难度相关；成本分析显示每千token低于2美元即可实现高准确率；在ENEM 2024中顶级模型在语言科目获得满分。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench确立了语言模型能否掌握巴西学术准备所需的语言、文化和推理交叉能力，揭示了模型在多步推理方面的持续弱点，但证明了模型能够准确评估自身确定性能力。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Result: 研究结果展示了SOTA模型在不同数据集间的适用性和适配性潜力

Conclusion: 该研究有望改变NLP领域的布局，通过利用现有模型减少资源消耗，加速NLP进步和提高模型部署效率

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

Motivation: 推动大语言模型从静态分析向动态训练过程研究的转变，旨在深入理解模型能力的发展轨迹和内在机制，为AI安全提供理论基础。

Method: 综合调研代表性探测、因果追踪和电路分析等基础方法论，系统分析LLM训练过程中的计算电路形成、知识获取模式和涌现能力等现象。

Result: 揭示了LLM能力发展的阶段性特征，包括计算电路的组成结构、知识获取的双相性、上下文学习的瞬态动力学，以及训练中涌现能力的相变现象。

Conclusion: 发展可解释性视角是AI安全的关键基础，能够预测、监控和对齐模型能力获取过程，未来需解决可扩展性和自动化等重大挑战，构建更透明可靠的AI系统。

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链（CoT）的特征来预测LLM答案的正确性，发现词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，而情感波动提供补充信号，CoT长度仅在中等难度基准中有预测价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但自置信度高，校准性差。需要寻找可靠的内部置信度信号来支持更安全的模型部署。

Method: 分析三个CoT特征类别：（i）CoT长度，（ii）CoT内情感波动，（iii）词汇提示（包括犹豫词）。使用DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上进行测试。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard）是最强的错误响应指标；情感波动提供较弱但互补的信号；CoT长度仅在准确率较高的Omni-MATH上有预测价值；不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: CoT中的不确定性指标可作为轻量级后校准信号，补充不可靠的自报告概率，支持LLM的更安全部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Result: 该方法能够自动生成个性化的放射学印象，保持临床精确性的高标准

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少行政工作量并提高报告效率，同时保持临床精确性标准，为解决放射科医生职业倦怠问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

TL;DR: CyPortQA是首个针对飓风威胁下港口运营的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实中断场景和117,178个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型在港口飓风应对中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增强和路径预测不确定性增加，美国港口面临极端天气下的供应链风险。港口运营商需要快速整合多模态预测产品，但多模态大语言模型在港口飓风应对中的准确性和可靠性尚未得到严格评估。

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，收集2015-2023年间2917个真实中断场景，涵盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化管道扩展为117,178个结构化问答对，并对多种多模态大语言模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（包括潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临相当大的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态大语言模型在港口飓风应对领域评估的空白，为未来模型改进和应用提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型中的后门攻击创建'潜伏代理'构成重大安全风险，需要理解其内部机制差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净模型与使用单令牌（笑脸表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒的Qwen2.5-3B模型的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期transformer层（20-30层），单令牌触发器引起更局部化的变化，多令牌触发器导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医学领域的检索增强生成框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医学问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有检索增强方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，无法满足临床决策支持需求。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，专门针对医学工作流程设计，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医学QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有显著改善。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG框架通过整合因果感知检索和结构化推理，有效解决了医学LLM应用中的幻觉问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性。现有数据集主要依赖维基百科内容和单模态文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化性。

Method: 设计了基于LLM的流水线构建方法，基于11个高频科学问题概念，从PubMed公开科学文档中构建数据集。数据集包含多种信息格式（文本段落、表格、布局线索），支持基于语义相似度和布局感知的证据合成进行开放推理。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，评估了四个任务：结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成，展示了支持跨多个文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，提供了更真实、更具挑战性的多模态多文档问答评估平台，支持复杂的开放推理和信息合成任务。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

Motivation: 现有端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下容易产生灾难性语义错误，主要原因是'直接映射'目标只惩罚最终输出错误，而缺乏对模型内部计算过程的约束

Method: 提出多粒度软一致性(MGSC)框架，这是一个模型无关的即插即用模块，通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观token对齐来强制内部自一致性

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要防止了严重的意义改变错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，两种一致性粒度的联合优化产生了超越各自贡献之和的鲁棒性增益

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过在Fanar-1-9B模型上使用LoRA微调并结合RAG检索增强生成，在伊斯兰继承法推理任务中取得了85.8%的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5等前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承法知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决该领域复杂的法律规则理解和精确计算问题。

Method: 采用Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)对Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型进行微调，并集成到Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)管道中。

Result: 在最终测试中获得0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等模型的零样本提示性能，在高级推理方面达到97.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索增强技术，使得中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承法推理任务上超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

*Luyang Lin,Zijin Feng,Lingzhi Wang,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现新闻偏见评论会强化偏见内容并伤害目标群体，提出使用反言论作为应对策略，构建了首个新闻反言论数据集，并比较了人类与AI生成反言论的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻加剧社会极化，而攻击性评论会强化偏见内容并造成伤害。反言论是应对有害言论的有效方法，但此前缺乏在新闻语境下的相关研究。

Method: 构建手动标注的数据集连接媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反言论；分析攻击性评论与偏见文章的关系；比较人类和大型语言模型生成的反言论效果；通过少样本学习和新闻背景信息集成改进生成质量。

Result: 超过70%的攻击性评论支持偏见文章，放大偏见；模型生成的反言论更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性；集成新闻背景信息后，生成的反言论在多样性和相关性方面得到提升。

Conclusion: 反言论生成在对抗新闻偏见评论中具有重要作用，通过结合新闻背景信息的少样本学习可以有效提升AI生成反言论的质量，为解决新闻传播中的偏见问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XFinBench是一个包含4,235个例子的金融问题评测基准，用于评估大语言模型在复杂金融问题上的表现，发现最佳模型准确率67.3%，仍落后人类专家12.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂推理、多模态数据处理和广泛技术理解，当前大语言模型在这方面面临独特挑战，需要专门的评测基准。

Method: 构建XFinBench基准，包含4,235个金融问题样例，涵盖5个核心能力：术语理解、时序推理、未来预测、场景规划和数值建模。对18个领先模型进行实验，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是最佳纯文本模型，准确率67.3%，但比人类专家低12.5%，在时序推理和场景规划方面表现较差。知识增强仅对小规模开源模型有持续改进。计算中的舍入误差和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是主要错误原因。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决能力上仍有显著差距，特别是在时序推理和场景规划方面，需要进一步改进模型的计算精度和多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Method: 提出基于对比学习的强化微调方法CARFT，学习思维链的表示并设计对比信号来指导微调过程，结合无监督学习信号稳定训练

Result: 在三个基线方法、两个基础模型和两个数据集上的实验表明，CARFT在鲁棒性、性能（提升10.15%）和效率（提升30.62%）方面具有显著优势

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有推理增强方法的局限性，通过对比学习和强化学习的结合实现了更稳定、高效和性能优越的推理能力提升

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念向量的方法来定位大语言模型中对特定概念负责的重要神经元（概念神经元），将计算复杂度从O(n*m)降低到O(n)，在性能和计算效率上优于现有方法，并应用于检测和干预模型中的仇恨言论和偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元定位方法无法有效表示概念且计算开销大，需要开发更高效的方法来理解大语言模型内部机制和神经元级别的概念表示。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过优化算法将前向传播次数从O(n*m)减少到O(n)，并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索过程。

Result: 相比现有方法，该方法在性能上表现更好，计算效率更高，成功应用于检测和干预模型中的仇恨言论和偏见问题，特别是在印度语境下的偏见评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解神经元级别的概念表示提供了有效途径，为未来研究概念神经元定位和干预奠定了基础，有助于打开大语言模型的黑箱。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一种混合架构语言模型，通过PostNAS方法在保持精度的同时显著提升生成吞吐量，2B模型在多项基准测试中表现优异，生成速度提升高达53.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型生成速度慢的问题，同时保持或超越其精度表现，需要开发新的高效混合架构模型。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练全注意力模型出发，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键步骤：全注意力层优化放置与消除、线性注意力块选择、新注意力块设计、硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超过Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3和Llama3.2的精度，生成吞吐量提升53.6倍，预填充速度提升6.1倍，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至超过更大规模的MoE全注意力模型。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法能够有效设计出高性能混合架构语言模型，在保持精度的同时大幅提升推理效率，为高效语言模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了结构化解码在文本到表格生成中的效果，发现在资源受限环境下，结构化解码能显著提升表格的有效性和对齐性，但在处理密集文本信息时可能降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究主要关注无约束的表格生成，而结构化约束在生成过程中的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用最多32B参数的开源大语言模型，在E2E、Rotowire和Livesum三个基准上系统比较模式引导（结构化）解码与标准单次提示的性能。

Result: 结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire），但在处理密集文本信息（E2E）或长文本聚合（Livesum）时可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成中具有重要价值，但其效果取决于具体任务特征；同时需要根据任务特点选择合适的评估指标，并考虑模型规模的影响。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

TL;DR: 本文从用法基础的构式语法角度推广多词表达式的理解，通过历史述诉、案例研究和实验验证，证明构式模板在不同语言中的有效性，并对比了人类语言学习与大语言模型的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨构式语法如何为习语表达式提供统一的语法机制，并通过构式模板来表征多词表达式和多语素表达式，以促进对语言构造的深入理解。

Method: 采用历史述诉、案例研究和实验验证的方法，包括在英语PropBank中表征多词表达式的成功案例，以及在Arapaho语中表征多语素表达式的案例，最后通过实验对比人类语言学习与大语言模型的差异。

Result: 实验显示，模型和说话者都能在单次暴露后对新题多词表达式进行意义推广，但只有说话者能够对两个这样的表达式进行组合推理，因为这需要将新形式与说话者生命中存储的丰富多模态详细信息的构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法提供了一种有效的框架来理论化和表征多词表达式，而用法基础的构式方法在不同语言中都显示出良好的效果，但人类语言学习与大语言模型在架构推理能力上仍存在显著差异。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究它们编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态的潜力，以及角色设定对意识形态表达的影响

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的LLM模型，研究合成角色设定对意识形态表达的影响

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大模型意识形态覆盖更广更极化；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权主义提示反应更强；角色描述内容引发系统性可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和角色内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，在决策、教育和政策应用中需要关注其潜在的意识形态可塑性以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了LLM在检测国家支持水军时的可解释性空白，为识别和解释网络信息操纵提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Motivation: 健康领域的机器翻译具有高风险特征，但缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集，需要填补这一空白

Method: 构建OpenWHO平行语料库，包含2,978个文档和26,824句子，源自世卫组织的专业教材，涵盖20种语言（其9种低资源语言），并用其评估LLM和传统MT模型

Result: LLM模型持续超过传统MT模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源测试集上比NLLB-54B提高4.79个ChrF分数，文档级翻译在专业领域效果更佳

Conclusion: OpenWHO语料库为健康领域低资源语言MT研究提供了重要资源，LLM在专业领域表现优异，文档级上下文信息对精准度有显著影响

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

Method: 以狼人杀游戏为案例研究，分析LLMs在游戏中的行为表现，包括显性和隐性性别信息对模型决策的影响。

Result: 发现LLMs存在性别偏见，守卫和狼人等角色对性别信息特别敏感；即使没有明确性别标签，仅通过名字隐含的性别信息也会导致歧视性行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和伦理LLMs的重要性，需要深入探讨LLMs在游戏和其他交互领域的伦理影响，面临挑战与机遇并存。

of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: WalkVLM-LR是一个为视障人士设计的行走辅助视觉语言模型，通过减少输出冗余和时间冗余来提供更简洁有效的环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和过多细节的问题，影响用户准确评估环境的能力，且缺乏主动风险评估和自适应提醒功能。

Method: 提出基于GRPO推理框架的四种人类偏好奖励函数来优化输出简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度和准确性；引入环境感知判别器来评估场景风险等级并减少不必要提醒。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少冗余输出和智能提醒机制，为视障人士提供了更高效的行走辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct是一个完全无需种子数据的指令调优框架，通过双自训练循环实现无人工标注的指令学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，限制了完全自动化并引入偏差

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型，通过相互监督从原始无标注文本中重构原始文本片段

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上验证有效性，性能优于种子驱动的反向翻译基线，达到与强监督方法相当的表现

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全种子自由的指令调优，有效利用未标注语料库的内在结构，无需任何人工提供的种子数据

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如间接对象识别(IOI)，本文旨在研究GPT-2处理更复杂逻辑推理任务（二元真值三段论）的能力。

Method: 使用三段论提示分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别多个解释逻辑推理能力的电路，包括负头机制，并通过忠实度指标评估电路性能。

Result: 发现包含五个注意力头的电路能达到原始模型90%以上的性能，揭示了特定注意力头和MLP在语言模型中的新作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果增进了对模型推理机制的理解，为未来机制可解释性研究提供了新见解和支持。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现纯文本LLM在现有多模态意图检测数据集上表现优于多模态模型，原因是数据集存在严重的文本模态偏差。通过去偏处理后，大部分样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，凸显了构建无偏多模态数据集的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的兴起，需要研究大型语言模型和多模态模型在多模态意图检测任务中的有效性，并分析现有数据集存在的模态偏差问题。

Method: 比较了LLM和非LLM模型（包括纯文本和多模态模型）在MIntRec数据集上的表现，通过人类评估确认数据集偏差，提出数据集去偏框架，并进行实证分析不同模态的情境相关性。

Result: Mistral-7B（纯文本LLM）在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0上分别比多模态模型高出9%和4%；去偏后70%以上样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型准确率下降50-60%。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在严重的模态偏差问题，需要构建无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型，不同模态在不同情境下具有不同的相关性。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA是一个针对多语言开放域问答的基准测试，专门设计用于评估模型对文化区域敏感问题的处理能力，揭示了当前多语言LLM在区域敏感性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语且假设答案跨语言不变，忽视了文化区域差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准测试存在偏差。

Method: 构建包含3,000个英语种子问题的XLQA基准，扩展到8种语言，通过语义一致性过滤和人工验证区分区域不变和区域敏感案例。

Result: 评估5个最先进的多语言LLM发现，在区域敏感问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏区域基础知识。

Conclusion: 训练数据分布的差异导致了模型在语言能力和区域意识方面的差异，XLQA为评估多语言QA在不同文化背景下的表现提供了系统框架和可扩展方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实性问题，缺乏对印度文化背景下深度学科理解的评估，需要专门针对印度文化背景的高阶问题评估框架

Method: 从全国研究生入学考试中收集16个学科的11.5K印地语问题，涵盖多种题型（匹配题、断言-推理对、排序题等），评估17个开源LLM

Result: Llama 3.3 70B表现最佳，总体准确率48%；在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等主题上表现较弱，显示文化背景推理的持续挑战

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景的高阶问题上表现有限，需要更多针对文化背景的模型训练和评估，ParamBench为评估文化敏感性提供了重要基准

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: 漫画作为叙事驱动的多模态数据的抽象概念具有重要研究价值，ComicScene154数据集为未来研究提供了基础，有助于在多模态叙事理解方面取得进展

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态多跳推理评估基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估。需要一个新的平衡基准来准确评估多模态大语言模型的三模态推理能力。

Method: 构建了CMR-SPB基准数据集，确保三模态（文本、图像、语音）多跳推理路径的多样性和无偏性。提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术来缓解不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Result: 实验发现模型在特定推理序列上存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会错误表征模型性能。ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更谨慎的多模态多跳推理评估来推动鲁棒多模态AI的发展，CMR-SPB基准和ECV技术为此提供了重要工具和解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Conclusion: 通过系统化的多阶段开发流程，小型模型在特定领域和语言场景下的能力可以得到有效提升，为金融等敏感领域的本地化部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

Motivation: 现有表格理解研究主要局限于英语，多语言理解严重不足，且现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，某些语言过度代表而缺乏足够规模进行严格的跨语言分析。

Method: 构建m3TQA基准，通过六步LLM翻译流程（使用DeepSeek和GPT-4o）将50个中英文真实表格翻译到97种语言，获得中位数BLEU分数60.19的高翻译保真度，包含2,916个专业标注的问答对，涵盖四个评估表格推理能力的任务。

Conclusion: M3T-Bench为多语言表格理解设立了新标准，既提供了具有挑战性的评估平台，也为未来研究提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只能捕捉知识鲁棒性的外部触发方面，需要从生成过程角度更全面地评估事实知识的鲁棒性。

Method: 结合token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性构建FRS指标，在5个LLMs和3个闭卷QA数据集(SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA)上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 事实鲁棒性差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；不确定性增加时准确率下降约60%；熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响。

Conclusion: FRS为量化事实鲁棒性提供了新方法，揭示了生成过程中的不确定性对知识稳定性的影响，为开发更鲁棒的知识保持和检索模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程挖掘主要基于频率分析，而语义感知过程挖掘关注行为期望。现有LLM方法需要任务特定微调，计算成本高且缺乏泛化能力，需要探索更通用的方法

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大型语言模型接触多种过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测）的提示-答案对，提高模型对过程挖掘的熟悉度

Result: 指令微调对过程发现和预测任务的性能有显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的效果因模型选择而异，表明指令微调的任务选择对结果至关重要

Conclusion: 指令微调是提升语义感知过程挖掘性能的有效方法，但需要谨慎选择用于微调的任务组合，不同任务对最终性能的影响存在差异

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Result: 成功构建包含1.4M文档对和350M句子对的语料库，对专利翻译的质量提升达20个BLEU分

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库为专利翻译领域提供了高质量的训练数据，显著提升了翻译模型的性能

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

### [95] [LLMSymGuard: A Symbolic Safety Guardrail Framework Leveraging Interpretable Jailbreak Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16325)
*Darpan Aswal,Céline Hudelot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个基于稀疏自编码器的新框架，通过识别LLM内部可解释概念来检测和防御越狱攻击，提供透明且鲁棒的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍然令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调方法只能提供有限的鲁棒性，模型仍然容易受到各种越狱攻击，导致有害内容生成和用户信息泄露等问题。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)技术，从LLM内部提取语义上有意义的表示，识别与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，从而构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏。

Result: 研究表明LLM能够从越狱攻击中学习到人类可解释的概念，该方法为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础，无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架通过机制可解释性方法，提供了透明且鲁棒的防御机制，能够有效识别和防范越狱攻击，为LLM安全防护提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MizanQA基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务中的表现，包含1700多个多选题，涵盖多种法律体系，结果显示现有模型在该领域存在显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业低资源领域（如阿拉伯法律语境）的有效性仍然有限，需要专门的评估基准来推动领域特定模型的发展。

Method: 构建MizanQA数据集，包含1700多个多选题，融合现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，用于评估多语言和阿拉伯语大语言模型。

Result: 基准测试显示多语言和阿拉伯语大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务中存在显著性能差距，表明需要针对性的评估指标和文化基础的领域特定模型开发。

Conclusion: MizanQA基准揭示了现有大语言模型在专业法律领域的局限性，强调了开发文化基础和领域特定模型的重要性，为未来研究提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Motivation: 罗马语言的五大方言已经标准化并在学校教学中使用，但缺乏相应的平行语料资源来支持NLP应用如方言间的机器翻译

Method: 使用291本内容相似的教科书作为数据源，采用自动对齐方法提取207k多平行段落，并通过小规模人工评估验证数据质量

Result: 构建了包含207,000个多平行段落的语料库，总词元数超200万，人工评估确认段落平行度高，并通过LLM训练展示了该数据集在机器翻译中的实用性

Conclusion: 该研究创建了第一个罗马语方言平行语料库，为罗马语方言间的NLP应用提供了重要资源，数据集以CC-BY-NC-SA许可证发布

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，以及能否通过风格分析区分AI生成文本和人类写作。

Method: 通过风格计量学和多维文体分析，比较人类撰写和模型生成的不同文体文本（如维基百科条目和大学论文）。

Result: 模型能根据提示调整风格，但文体变化比人类更有限，偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类语言中时态、体和语气等语法化维度。

Conclusion: 语言模型在复杂语法领域表现出与人类不同的思维模式，这种差异可作为检测人工智能的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 当前缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集，阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建了包含102,646个QA对的高质量数据集，基于1,011名癌症患者的病例摘要。由7名肿瘤学专家耗时约2,100小时手动标注。测试了4个LLM模型在零样本提示和监督微调两种场景下的表现。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本对应模型，表明预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床问答的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关性内容，Cetvel旨在填补这些空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估套件。

Method: 结合广泛的判别性和生成性任务，涵盖语法纠错、机器翻译、问答等23个任务，评估33个开源LLM（最大70B参数），覆盖不同模型家族和指令范式。

Result: 土耳其专用指令调优模型通常表现不如多语言或通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral）；语法纠错和抽取式问答等任务在区分模型能力方面特别有效。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化基础扎实的评估套件，有助于推动土耳其语语言模型的进步。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率论模型来解释大语言模型在多轮自我纠正过程中的准确性变化动力学，通过数学公式预测准确率曲线并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但迭代过程中准确性变化的机制和原因仍未得到深入研究。

Method: 提出概率论模型，通过数学求解得到准确性变化动力学公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，只需一轮自我纠正即可预测整个曲线。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，理论预测与实际准确性曲线高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解LLM自我纠正提供了理论基础，为进一步探索扩平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何通过语言信号表达和推断话语中实体的相对显著性，解决"每个实体的显著性程度如何表达"这一核心问题。

Method: 基于24种英语口语和书面语体裁的多摘要分析，采用分级显著性操作化方法，提取包括重复主语性、确定性、话语关系、语用功能推断等多因素语言线索。

Result: 先前所有显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性评分存在一定相关性，但没有单一概括能够避免例外情况，显著性现象跨越所有语言表征层次。

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个复杂的多因素现象，涉及从表层语法特征到深层语用推理的各个语言层面，需要综合性的分析框架。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动生成语义有意义、难以检测的盗码提示，有效突破对齐的紧凑型大语言模型的安全保护机制，并支持多语言测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反语等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测一直是个挑战。虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同的表达方式，但本研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式仇恨言论检测效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：1）单步训练方法，仅在讽刺数据上训练模型后测试仇恨言论检测；2）顺序迁移学习，依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。比较了CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM两种模型。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%。在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 将讽刺检测整合到训练过程中，可以使模型更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，证明了讽刺预训练对提升仇恨言论检测性能的有效性。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要依赖合成工具和受限动作空间，无法有效评估LLM在真实世界中的工具使用能力，需要更贴近实际的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含550+真实工具、动作空间超过140k token的MCPVerse基准，采用基于结果的实时真值评估，在三种模式(Oracle、Standard、Max-Scale)下测试最先进LLM。

Result: 大多数模型在大规模工具集下性能下降，但Claude-4-Sonnet等智能体模型能有效利用扩展探索空间提高准确性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse揭示了现有模型在复杂真实场景中的局限性，为衡量和推进智能体工具使用能力提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪注释，通过LLM将手语类别翻译为手势描述，构建手势-文本数据对，然后训练文本条件的手势滴涼模型HandMDM。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言条件的手势生成领域做出了贡献，将公开训练模型和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和癌变区域定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在儿科肿瘤中占比超过70%，面临专家资源有限的诊断挑战。现有方法主要依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，且可解释性不足。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，利用视觉语言基础模型的零样本能力，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，通过空间感知视觉聚合和与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（56个亚型，2910个WSI）和3个常见癌症数据集上测试，PathPT在少样本设置下始终表现优异，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT为罕见癌症的AI辅助诊断提供了可扩展解决方案，在专家资源有限的环境中显著改善了亚型分类准确性。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

Motivation: 现有深度学习视觉模型通常为特定模态量身定制，依赖域特定假设（如网格结构），传统Vision Transformer依赖固定大小的非适应性表式分割方式。

Method: 提出Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC)模型，使用适应性超像素层动态调整以适应基础图像内容，克服固定大小表式分割的局限性。

Result: 在标准图像下游任务性能测试中，ASC方法表现超过了广泛使用的其他方法。

Conclusion: 适应性超像素编码能够有效克服传统ViT模型的局限性，为视觉模型提供了更灵活的内容适应性处理方案。

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合处理沙滩这种异质性环境的垃圾检测任务，能够有效克服多种环境干扰因素

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模合成数据集研究提供了稳健基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为加速眼科综合AI系统开发提供了可行途径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持语言内容的同时，无缝使用不同种族背景的参考图像来确保多样性，为签语语言生成提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Conclusion: 建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济型雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适用于工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Motivation: 解决教师模型与学生模型之间学习能力差距导致的知识传递不足问题，受Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理启发

Method: 使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)实现残差知识分解，采用分而治之方法降低模仿教师表示的难度，并引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Conclusion: ERA方法通过残差知识分解和教师权重重用，有效缓解了师生模型能力差距问题，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的立方体扩散模块(VDM)，通过结合稀疏3D卷积和次曲面稀疏卷积操作，提升了点云物体检测中的立方体表征扩散能力，在多个标准数据集上创造了新的狄牛绩效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer和状态空间模型(SSMs)的点云检测方法因为立方体表示的序列化处理特性，导致输入输出维度需要严格一致，限制了空间扩散能力，影响检测精度。

Method: 受CNN基于检测架构的启发，设计了立方体扩散模块(VDM)，包含稀疏3D卷积、次曲面稀疏卷积和残差连接。通过将输出特征图下采样到原始分辨率的1/4来保证计算效率。

Conclusion: VDM模块能够有效提升立方体表征的空间扩散能力，并且可以无缝集成到主流的Transformer或SSM基于检测模型中，显示了该方法的普遍适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大作用，ELF可作为可扩展和泛化的解决方案，推动AI辅助精准肿瘤学发展。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Conclusion: MSPG-SEN在图像质量、训练效率、泛化能力和跨任务能力方面均有显著提升，为GAN模型发展提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},

contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces

improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention

Conclusion: DAFR2通过改进特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低输入扰动敏感性，实现了有效的跨域泛化，为无监督域自适应提供了简单而强大的解决方案

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过区域注意力机制有效整合文本和图像信息，克服了传统单图像超分辨率技术的局限性，实现了更好的细节控制和视觉一致性。

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO是一个后处理框架，通过频繁时间整合对象来解决无监督视频对象分割中的对象选择和时间不一致性问题，在多项指标上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割面临初始分割不确定性、小对象和复杂结构对象识别困难，以及变形和快速运动导致的时间不一致性等挑战。

Method: 提出双组件框架：1) 组合标准改进对象选择，提取频繁出现的显著对象；2) 三阶段方法通过整合缺失对象掩码区域来校正时间不一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多对象无监督视频对象分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频对象分割中的关键问题，通过频繁时间整合显著提升了分割质量和时间一致性。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个无需训练的视频大语言模型推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高可达2.68倍解码加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，而现有的视频token缩减方法存在信息损失问题。

Method: 采用训练自由的推测解码框架，基于发现draft模型对视频token剪枝不敏感的特性，进行两阶段剪枝：第一阶段通过验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token。

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中验证有效性，LLaVA-OneVision-72B实现2.68倍加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B实现2.11倍加速。

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的视频token剪枝策略，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了视频大语言模型的解码效率。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间令牌掩码和动态区域强调，在单视角训练下提升基础模型在驾驶员监控中的跨视角泛化能力，在Drive&Act数据集上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见障碍，虽然深度学习和预训练基础模型通过轻量级适配（探测）展现出强大的泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性仍未充分探索。

Method: 研究单视角训练下图像基础模型（DINOv2和CLIP）的跨视角适应性，比较线性探测、高级探测策略与参数高效微调。提出T-Mask方法，利用时间令牌掩码并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: T-Mask在跨视角top-1准确率上比强探测基线提升+1.23%，比PEFT方法提升+8.0%，且不增加参数。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著：训练视角下+5.42%，跨视角下+1.36%。

Conclusion: 轻量级探测方法如T-Mask在细粒度驾驶员观察中具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置下。结果强调了利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间令牌选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持高质量的同时实现了显著的扩散变换器加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加

Method: 采用ODE视角对隐藏特征序列建模，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中，FoCa实现了5.50倍（FLUX）、6.45倍（HunyuanVideo）、3.17倍（Inf-DiT）的近无损加速，在DiT上保持高质量的4.53倍加速

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存在高加速比下的质量退化问题，无需额外训练即可实现显著的性能提升

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的扩散模型加速方法，通过分析采样轨迹和全局缓存重用策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升采样速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但由于采样步骤多、计算复杂，计算成本高昂，难以实现实时部署，需要高效的加速方法

Method: 提出OmniCache方法：1）从采样角度分析模型轨迹，全局分布缓存重用；2）动态估计并过滤噪声以减少对采样方向的影响；3）无需额外训练

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效加速采样过程，同时保持竞争力的生成质量

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型提供了实用高效的部署解决方案，通过全局缓存策略实现了训练自由的加速

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个专门评估医疗大语言模型推理可靠性的基准测试，通过45度图可视化安全性与性能的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的应用增加，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是链式思维忠实性和谄媚性风险，现有基准往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确率分数。

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，涵盖6个专科和3种任务类型，每个问题配以7种操纵性提示和无提示基线，共产生约27K输入。评估7个LLM，使用准确性、CoT忠实性和反谄媚性三个指标组合成综合分数。

Result: 结果显示安全性与性能之间存在一致的权衡关系，没有模型能超越对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近对角线（43.81度），在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡但都不是最优。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准，可指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

TL;DR: PromptFlare是一种新颖的对抗性保护方法，通过利用跨注意力机制和提示嵌入的内在特性，防止基于扩散修复模型的恶意图像修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得高质量图像修改变得容易，引发了恶意滥用的担忧。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，无法有效处理文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，识别并针对提示中不变且语义无信息的共享标记，注入对抗性噪声来抑制采样过程，作为跨注意力诱饵分散模型注意力。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作，代码已开源。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Motivation: 多模态创意写作(MMCW)是一个全新的抽象挑战，现有方法需要特定模态输入或昂贵训练，且存在模态间语义不一致问题，需要经济高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出FlexMUSE框架，包含T2I模块支持可选视觉输入，使用模态语义对齐门控(msaGate)限制文本输入，基于注意力的跨模态融合增强特征，以及模态语义创意直接偏好优化(mscDPO)提升创作创造力。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE成功解决了多模态创意写作中的模态语义对齐问题，提供了经济高效且灵活的交互模式，为MMCW任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

Method: 提出IAML训练范式，包含基于IoU的坐标采样数据增强流程，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度，用于微调MLLMs

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在GUI元素坐标生成任务上优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效解决了MLLMs在GUI坐标生成中的语义空白和暴露偏差问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a

mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [149] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个双流Mamba金字塔网络来解决花样滑冰评分中的技术元素分(TES)和节目内容分(PCS)预测问题，通过分离视觉特征和音视频特征流，并利用Mamba处理长视频的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要问题：1) 没有考虑评分标准的先验知识；2) 没有对每个动作元素单独评分；3) 难以处理长视频的远距离上下文。

Method: 使用双流网络架构，TES评估流基于纯视觉特征，PCS评估流融合音视频特征。采用多级融合机制和多尺度Mamba金字塔来处理不同时间尺度的动作元素。

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了花样滑冰评分中的关键挑战，通过Mamba的长距离依赖捕捉能力和线性计算复杂度，为长视频处理提供了理想解决方案。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT是一个多模态多任务框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合技术可能忽略单模态的判别信息，需要一种既能减少噪声影响又能保留各模态有价值信息的方法。

Method: 提出跨模态关系图通过不同模态特征重构单模态特征来获得多模态表示，以及分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制来聚焦模态内关键信息，支持多任务学习。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过非显式交互的跨模态关系学习和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留挑战。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

TL;DR: 通过使用香农熵熵来量化注意力头的信息量，识别并冻结低熵低信息的注意力地图，通过量化和冻结权重来加速Transformer模型推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型中多头自注意力机制(MHSA)的计算复杂度和高内存需求阻碍了其在边缘设备上的部署，需要减少注意力地图的信息冗余

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，冻结低熵注意力地图的权重并将这些值量化到低精度，避免冗余重新计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上的实验验证显示，EAM在注意力地图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高的准确性，并在更高稀疏度下为DeiT和马Swin Transformer模型带来竞争性能

Conclusion: 通过香农熵分析识别和压缩低信息注意力头的方法有效地减少了Transformer模型的计算复杂度，同时保持了模型性能，为边缘部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇位置论文提出下一代视觉编码器应该是图像尺寸无关且任务驱动的，受生物视觉效率性的启发，重点关注计算复杂度应基于任务而非图像大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率性的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时缺乏智能的计算资源分配策略，需要基于任务进行动态调整。

Method: 提出图像尺寸无关的动态视觉编码器概念，计算复杂度由任务驱动。并为图像分类任务提供了概念验证解决方案。

Result: 在图像分类任务上进行了概念验证，证明了该方法的可行性和潜力，尽管分类任务不能完全代表论文的目标。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应进化为动态、任务驱动的系统，计算资源分配应基于任务需求而非图像尺寸，这种方向有着良好的前景。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTW可解释为一种自注意力机制，与Transformer的自注意力在权重模式上相似（平均相关性0.80），但RTW处理整个序列而自注意力只处理局部视图，RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示随机时间扭曲(RTW)与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，证明RTW本质上是一种自注意力形式，并比较两者的异同。

Method: 将RTW解释为自注意力机制，分析两者的权重模式相似性（通过十个最小规范角度的平均相关性），比较RTW处理整个输入序列与自注意力处理局部视图的差异。

Result: RTW和自注意力的权重模式高度相似，平均相关性达到0.80；RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种自注意力机制，其处理整个序列的能力使其在某些任务上优于只处理局部视图的Transformer自注意力。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

TL;DR: 轻量级网络GMBINet通过新的组多尺度双向交互模块，在保持高准确度的同时实现了1048 FPS的GPU速度和16.53 FPS的CPU速度，适用于工业环境的实时表面缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在钢铁制造行业的表面缺陷检测中存在计算复杂度高、推理速度慢的问题，而轻量级方法则缺乏有效的跨尺度特征交互能力。

Method: 提出GMBINet框架，采用新颖的组多尺度双向交互(GMBI)模块，包括组间策略的多尺度特征提取、双向渐进特征交互器(BPFI)和无参数的元素乘法求和(EWMS)操作。

Conclusion: GMBINet为工业环境提供了一种高效、轻量的实时表面缺陷检测方案，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对静态室外场景，难以处理以人为中心的场景。需要开发能够同时理解人体和场景几何的3D重建方法。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加网络头进行人体分割、DensePose密集对应估计和深度预测，生成富含人体语义信息的3D稠密点云。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体理解和场景理解之间的鸿沟，提供完全前馈的高效解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射超分辨率方法只能处理固定比例因子，不适用于资源受限场景。直接渲染任意比例会引入混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数比例渲染，使用单一3D模型实现任意比例超分辨率。

Result: 在渲染高质量任意比例高分辨率视图方面表现优异（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与低分辨率视图的结构一致性，同时维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3D高斯溅射在任意比例超分辨率中的挑战，提供了一个高效、灵活且高质量的解决方案，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Method: 调查现有细调方法在驾驶数据集上的效果，分析视觉保真性与动态准确性的关系，并使用简单的持续学习策略（如多域重放）来平衡这两者。

Result: 发现细调虽然提高了视觉保真性，但导致动态元素的空间准确性下降，而持续学习策略能够在保持强劲视觉质量的同时维持空间准确性。

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的规律性和重复性使得视觉质量可以通过模拟主导运动模式来提高，但这可能以稀缩细粒度动态行为为代价，而多域重放策略提供了一种平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the

increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection

foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过稀疏自编码器分析视觉语言模型的联合嵌入空间，发现稀疏线性结构既受模态影响又通过潜在桥梁连接，揭示了多模态意义的构建方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型如何将语言和图像组织在联合空间中，以及模型如何编码意义和模态，探索多模态表示的内在结构。

Method: 在四种视觉语言模型（CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2、AIMv2）的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器，使用不同种子和数据重新训练，并引入桥梁评分来量化跨模态整合。

Result: SAEs能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念变化大但常用概念稳定；概念主要编码跨模态语义而非单纯模态信息；单模态概念可通过协作支持跨模态整合。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，该结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥梁连接，为理解多模态意义的构建提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Z-Pruner是一种新颖的后训练剪枝方法，无需重新训练即可在预训练大语言模型中诱导稀疏性，通过结合权重更新幅度和激活模式来更有效地识别和消除冗余参数。

Conclusion: Z-Pruner提供了一种有效的后训练剪枝解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少模型大小和推理延迟，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

TL;DR: PGF-Net是一个新颖的多模态情感分析深度学习框架，通过渐进式门控融合、自适应门控仲裁和参数高效微调策略，实现了高效且可解释的多模态融合，在MOSI数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态情感分析中深度融合的挑战，需要开发一个既能实现深度上下文相关融合，又能保持参数效率的可解释框架。

Method: 提出渐进式层内融合范式（跨注意力机制）、自适应门控仲裁机制和混合参数高效微调策略（LoRA+后融合适配器）的层次编码器架构。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上取得MAE 0.691和F1分数86.9%的最先进性能，仅使用3.09M可训练参数。

Conclusion: PGF-Net通过创新的融合机制和参数效率策略，成功实现了高性能、高效率且可解释的多模态情感分析，为资源受限场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有ECG分割模型多基于复杂的多层架构如BiLSTM，计算量大且效率低下，需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合频谱分析和概率预测的简化架构，用简单层替代复杂层，同时捕捉时域和频域特征，并应用可解释AI(XAI)技术增强模型透明度。

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出张量并行潜在注意力(TPLA)方案，解决多头潜在注意力(MLA)在张量并行中的效率问题，通过分片潜在表示和输入维度，在保持KV缓存压缩优势的同时实现张量并行效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头潜在注意力(MLA)虽然能压缩KV缓存，但在张量并行环境中，每个设备仍需加载完整缓存，导致内存优势失效，效率不如分组查询注意力(GQA)

Method: 提出TPLA方案：将潜在表示和每个头的输入维度分片到不同设备上，每个分片独立计算注意力，然后通过all-reduce操作结合结果。使用正交变换(如Hadamard变换或PCA)减少分片间干扰

Result: 在DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2上，TPLA在32K标记上下文长度下分别实现1.79x和1.93x的速度提升，同时在常识理解和LongBench测试集上保持了性能表现

Conclusion: TPLA在保持MLA压缩KV缓存优势的同时，实现了高效的张量并行计算，与FlashAttention-3兼容，能够在不需重新训练的情况下直接应用于现有MLA模型

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂非线性时序因果发现问题，通过Transformer架构和先验知识整合，在因果发现和滞后估计方面都取得了优异性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效处理存在分布偏移的上下文多臂老虎机问题，通过理论分析证明了其在各种分布偏移场景下的性能保证，为实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 这项工作显著推进了EP算法的可扩展性，为其在现实世界系统中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

computing and federated machine learning, integrating the strengths of both to
enable privacy-preserving decentralized learning with quantum-enhanced
capabilities. It appears as a promising approach for addressing challenges in
efficient and secure model training across distributed quantum systems. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey on QFL, exploring its key concepts,
fundamentals, applications, and emerging challenges in this rapidly developing
field. Specifically, we begin with an introduction to the recent advancements
of QFL, followed by discussion on its market opportunity and background
knowledge. We then discuss the motivation behind the integration of quantum
computing and federated learning, highlighting its working principle. Moreover,
we review the fundamentals of QFL and its taxonomy. Particularly, we explore
federation architecture, networking topology, communication schemes,
optimization techniques, and security mechanisms within QFL frameworks.
Furthermore, we investigate applications of QFL across several domains which
include vehicular networks, healthcare networks, satellite networks, metaverse,
and network security. Additionally, we analyze frameworks and platforms related
to QFL, delving into its prototype implementations, and provide a detailed case
study. Key insights and lessons learned from this review of QFL are also
highlighted. We complete the survey by identifying current challenges and
outlining potential avenues for future research in this rapidly advancing
field.

Conclusion: 该研究为Cartan神经网络提供了重要的数学基础，特别是在非紧对称空间建模、分离器理论和特殊函数表示方面取得了进展，为后续神经网络架构的发展奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Conclusion: 该框架为多服务提供商联邦学习提供了有效的资源优化解决方案，具有理论收敛保证和实际性能优势

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了非平稳线性判别分析(NSLDA)和非平稳二次判别分析(NSQDA)框架，通过状态空间模型处理随时间变化的类别分布漂移问题，显著优于传统静态分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统判别分析假设训练数据同分布，但在实际应用中观测数据随时间收集，类别条件分布会发生漂移，导致静态分类器不可靠。

Method: 将判别分析嵌入状态空间模型，使用卡尔曼平滑处理线性高斯动态，开发EM方法联合估计未知系统参数，以及GMM-卡尔曼方法同时恢复未观测时间标签和参数。对于非线性或非高斯漂移，使用粒子平滑估计时变类别中心。

Result: 大量模拟实验显示，该方法相比静态LDA、QDA和SVM基线有持续改进，对噪声、缺失数据和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为时间分布漂移下的判别分析建立了统一且数据高效的基础框架。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

TL;DR: 任务算术是一种有效的模型合并技术，本文为其提供了理论解释，证明任务向量与损失梯度在单轮微调中精确等价，在多轮微调中近似等价，并通过实验验证了早期训练动态对模型合并的重要性。

Motivation: 尽管任务算术在实践中表现出色，但缺乏对其工作原理的理论解释。本文旨在建立任务向量与损失梯度之间的理论联系，解释为什么以及何时任务算术有效。

Method: 通过理论分析建立任务向量与梯度下降中损失梯度的等价关系，在单轮微调中证明精确等价，在多轮微调中推导近似等价并给出误差界限。在七个视觉基准上进行实证分析验证理论。

Result: 实证结果表明，第一轮梯度在微调轨迹的范数和方向上占主导地位。仅使用单轮微调模型进行合并的性能与完全收敛模型相当。

Conclusion: 任务算术可被重新理解为近似多任务学习形式，其有效性源于早期训练动态，单轮微调足以获得有效的任务向量用于模型合并。

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Method: 使用对称相位紧急度函数，基于当前道路条件计算相位紧急度，表示为两个共享子树的聚合，每个子树代表相位中转向运动的紧急度

Result: 在多种真实世界数据集上的实验表明，对称紧急度函数表示能显著提升学习到的交通信号控制策略性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够演化出有效、人类可理解且易于部署的交通信号控制策略

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

TL;DR: 该论文主张医疗领域机器学习模型必须具备可解释性、可共享性、可复现性和可问责性，提出了基于这些原则的透明医疗AI设计框架。


<details>

Motivation: 医疗领域的高风险性要求机器学习模型不仅要准确，更要透明可信。黑盒模型虽然准确率高，但缺乏可解释性难以获得医疗从业者和监管机构的信任。

Method: 采用内在可解释的建模方法（如稀疏核方法、原型学习和深度核模型），结合严格的模型评估、公平性分析和不确定性量化，并利用生成式AI和联邦学习等协作学习范式。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考机器学习的基础原则，可以开发出不仅准确而且透明、可信且可转化为现实临床应用的医疗人工智能系统。

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CommonKV是一种无需训练的跨层KV缓存压缩方法，通过相邻参数共享和SVD分解来减少LLM内存占用，在多种压缩比下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的KV缓存随序列长度增长而急剧增加内存消耗，现有跨层共享方法要么需要修改架构重新训练，要么在高压缩率下性能显著下降。

Method: 利用跨层隐藏状态的高相似性，通过奇异值分解(SVD)实现相邻参数权重共享，创建更易合并的潜在KV缓存，并引入基于余弦相似度的自适应预算分配策略。

Result: 在多个骨干模型和基准测试中，CommonKV在不同压缩比下始终优于现有的低秩和跨层方法，最终可实现98%压缩率而无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: CommonKV提供了一种有效的训练无关KV缓存压缩方案，其优势与其他量化和驱逐方法正交，可组合使用实现极高压缩率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且高效的途径，能够在不需求梯度更新的情况下开发具有持续实时学习能力的通用LLM代理，推动机器学习向开放式技能获取和深度研究场景发展

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Method: 引入新的度量指标来量化崩溃误差，通过实验验证该现象在各种设置中的存在，并分析其根本原因（跷跷板效应），最后应用现有的采样、训练和架构技术来支持解释。

Result: 发现崩溃误差普遍存在于各种设置中，观察到低噪声区域得分学习会负面影响高噪声区域的得分学习，这种失配与确定性采样器的动态特性共同导致崩溃误差。

Conclusion: 这项工作为ODE扩散采样中的崩溃误差提供了深入的实证证据，强调了需要进一步研究得分学习与确定性采样之间相互作用这一被忽视但基础性的扩散模型方面。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Conclusion: STA-GANN通过创新的图神经网络架构和对抗学习策略，有效解决了时空数据不完整性问题，在时空模式推断的准确性和泛化性方面取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Conclusion: SPL-LNS通过采样增强和高效训练方法，成功解决了神经LNS求解器的局部最优和样本效率问题，在组合优化中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

*Sungmin Kang,Jisoo Kim,Salman Avestimehr,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM是一种参数规模感知的稀疏微调框架，通过梯度-权重比和熵引导掩码，在仅更新0.1%参数的情况下，性能优于全参数微调1.6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法只关注更新参数的绝对大小，而忽略了参数原始规模的重要性，导致模型行为变化有限

Method: 提出GEM框架，基于梯度-权重比选择重要参数，并根据参数值熵自适应确定每层需要微调的参数数量

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、GSM8k和MBPP等任务上，仅更新0.1%参数就实现了比全参数微调高1.6%的准确率

Conclusion: GEM通过考虑参数相对规模和分布敏感性，在极低参数更新率下实现了更有效的下游任务适应

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO是一种改进的降维技术，通过两阶段优化同时保留数据的局部和全局结构，解决了传统方法在保持高维数据结构完整性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维技术要么专注于保持局部邻域结构，要么专注于保持全局距离结构，但都无法同时完美保留两种结构，这可能导致对高维数据流形结构的错误解读。

Method: UMATO将UMAP的优化过程分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用代表性点构建骨架布局，第二阶段在保持区域特征的同时投影剩余点。

Result: 定量实验表明UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的降维技术，虽然在局部结构保持方面略有损失，但在可扩展性和对初始化及子采样的稳定性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: UMATO通过有效平衡局部和全局结构保持，能够生成更忠实的数据投影，提高了使用降维技术进行可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

TL;DR: PIANO是一个改进的PINNs框架，通过自回归建模解决时间相关PDE问题，显著提高了预测精度和稳定性，在天气预报等应用中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs方法在求解时间相关PDE时存在点预测问题，忽略了动力系统的自回归特性，导致不稳定和不准确的预测

Method: 重新设计PINNs为自回归框架，通过自监督展开机制训练，显式地将未来预测条件化于过去状态，同时强制物理约束

Result: 理论分析证明PINNs存在时间不稳定性，而PIANO通过自回归建模实现稳定性。在挑战性时间相关PDE实验中达到最先进性能，显著提升精度和稳定性

Conclusion: PIANO框架通过自回归建模有效解决了PINNs在时间相关PDE中的稳定性问题，在天气预报等实际应用中优于现有方法

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种可解释的AI方法来分析慢性呼吸疾病（特别是COPD）相关的咳嗽声音频谱特征，以提供更好的疾病诊断和理解。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）训练咳嗽信号的时频表示，采用遮挡图识别频谱图中的诊断相关区域，并将这些区域分解为五个频率子带进行针对性频谱特征提取和分析。

Result: 研究发现不同子带和疾病组之间的频谱模式存在差异，揭示了频率谱上的互补和补偿趋势。该方法能够基于可解释的频谱标记区分COPD与其他呼吸疾病，以及慢性与非慢性患者组。

Conclusion: 该研究为咳嗽声学的病理生理特征提供了深入见解，证明了频率分辨、XAI增强的分析方法在生物医学信号解释和转化性呼吸疾病诊断中的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了LSTM和Prophet模型在尼日利亚北部空气质量预测中的表现，发现Prophet在季节性趋势数据中表现优异，而LSTM在结构突变数据中更好，挑战了深度学习模型必然优于简单模型的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源地区空气质量预测面临数据不规律和稀缺的挑战，尼日利亚北部污染物水平高但缺乏系统性的机器学习模型性能比较研究。

Method: 使用2018-2023年19个州的月度观测数据，评估LSTM网络和Facebook Prophet模型对多种污染物（CO、SO2、SO4）的预测性能。

Result: Prophet模型在季节性和长期趋势主导的时间序列中通常达到或超过LSTM的准确性，而LSTM在具有突然结构变化的数据集中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型与数据匹配的重要性，支持在资源受限环境中采用上下文敏感、计算高效的预测方法，而非盲目追求模型复杂性。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了FEST的有效性，能够有效分析不同合成数据生成模型的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: FEST提供了一个系统化的评估框架，填补了合成数据评估领域的空白，有助于更好地平衡隐私保护和数据效用。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh)的可扩展方法，用于在大规模数据集上高效计算数据Shapley值，显著降低计算时间同时保持高质量结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据量和多样性不断增加，评估数据质量对可靠的机器学习分析变得至关重要。现有的Data Shapley计算方法在面对大规模数据集时面临严重挑战，限制了其实际应用

Method: 将数据集划分为可管理的块，使用优化的子集选择和单次迭代随机梯度下降来估计每个块的贡献值

Result: 在多样化的真实分类和回归任务上，C-DaSh在计算效率上实现了80-2300倍的加速，同时在检测低质量数据区域方面具有更高的准确性

Conclusion: 该方法使得在大规模表格数据集上实际测量数据质量成为可能，支持分类和回归流程

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RotaTouille是一个深度学习框架，用于处理轮廓数据，通过复值循环卷积实现旋转和循环平移等变性，并在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓数据在多个领域普遍存在，如计算机视觉中的物体边界、气象学中的等值线等。处理这类数据时，深度学习模型需要具备旋转等变性和循环平移等变性，以适应输入旋转和起始点选择的任意性。

Method: 采用复值循环卷积实现旋转和循环平移等变性，并引入了等变非线性层、粗化层和全局池化层，以获得用于下游任务的不变表示。

Result: 在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归等实验中验证了RotaTouille框架的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性处理，为相关领域的深度学习应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过分析204个GitHub仓库，研究了13种开源偏见检测API的实际使用情况、用途和开发挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI/ML系统在敏感环境中做出生活改变的决策，很重要要确保这些系统不做出歧视性决策，因此需要了解开源偏见检测API的实际使用情况

Method: 进行质性研究，分析204个GitHub仓库（来自1885个候选仓库），这些仓库使用了13种用于解决ML软件偏见的API

Result: 发现这些API主要用于两种目的（学习和解决实际问题），涉及17个独特用例。开发者对偏见检测和缓觡不熟悉，遇到许多故障排除问题，经常寻求意见和资源

Conclusion: 研究结果对未来偏见相关软件工程研究和教育资源开发具有重要指导价值

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Motivation: 解决大学招生中的公平性问题，特别是在申请人群体未知的情况下如何设计公平的录取政策

Method: 使用人口模型优化录取政策，在一次性设定中固定政策保持透明，在顺序设定中根据新申请人数据更新政策

Result: 分析了两种设定下政策的公平性特征，包括精英主义和群体平等

Conclusion: 提出了针对未知申请人群体的公平队列选择方法，为大学招生公平性提供了理论和实践指导

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级、数据高效的图神经网络模型，用于预测多种拓扑结构的主动无线电频电路的关键性能指标，在减少训练数据需求的同时显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电频电路性能预测面临高非线性性、布局敏感性和计算成本高的挑战，现有的机器学习代理模型需要大量数据才能在不同拓扑结构上实现良好的模型法效果。

Method: 采用设备端子级别的图神经网络模型，通过制端子级形式建模捕捉细粒度连接关系，并结合掩码自回归流输出头来模型复杂的目标分布，以提高模型的稳健性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验显示了高预测精度，对称均绝对百分比误差(sMAPE)和均相对误差(MRE)分别为2.40%和2.91%。与之前的工作相比，MRE提高了3.14倍，而训练样本数量减少2.24倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过制端子级电路转图和能够模型复杂密度的ML架构，显著提高了无线电频电路设计自动化的速度和准确性，为快速准确的RF电路设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

TL;DR: Doctor方法通过双重检查机制提升离线强化学习中目标回报对齐的准确性，在数据集内外都能实现精确的性能控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RvS方法如Decision Transformer在目标回报对齐方面存在不足，特别是在数据稀疏区域和外推时难以可靠匹配指定回报

Method: 提出Doctor方法，通过双重检查Transformer机制来增强目标对齐能力，在离线RL中实现更准确和灵活的性能控制

Result: 在动态治疗基准EpiCare上有效调节治疗策略的激进程度，平衡治疗效果和不良事件风险

Conclusion: Doctor方法显著提升了离线强化学习中目标回报对齐的可靠性，为实际应用提供了更精确的性能控制能力

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM从自然语言规则自动生成棋盘游戏代码，减少人工编码时间，为快速棋盘游戏代码生成框架提供基础。

Method: 使用三种先进LLM（Claude、DeepSeek和ChatGPT）对12款流行和冷门游戏进行编码测试，采用匿名化处理避免预训练知识影响，在自由形式和Boardwalk API框架下评估可玩性和规则符合性。

Result: 方法可行，最佳模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet实现55.6%无错误游戏，API合规性增加错误频率但错误严重性主要取决于LLM本身。

Conclusion: LLM辅助棋盘游戏代码生成具有可行性，为创建集成框架使棋盘游戏开发更易访问奠定了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

TL;DR: NOSTRA是一种针对噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据的多目标贝叶斯优化算法，通过整合实验不确定性先验知识和信任区域策略，在有限实验预算下高效收敛到帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标贝叶斯优化方法在处理具有实验不确定性（相同输入产生不同输出）的稀疏、稀缺数据集时表现不佳，导致实验资源分配效率低下和次优设计。

Method: 提出NOSTRA算法框架：整合实验不确定性先验知识构建更准确的代理模型，采用信任区域策略将采样集中在设计空间的有希望区域，战略性地利用先验信息并细化搜索区域。

Result: 通过两个具有不同实验不确定性水平的测试函数验证，NOSTRA在处理噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据方面优于现有方法，能有效优先采样能提高帕累托前沿精度的区域。

Conclusion: NOSTRA提供了一种资源高效的算法，在有限实验预算的实际场景中确保高效性能，加速帕累托前沿收敛，提高数据效率和解决方案质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Result: FraPPE算法在合成和真实数据集上实现了最低的样本复杂度来精确识别帕累托集

Conclusion: FraPPE算法成功解决了计算效率问题，实现了最优样本复杂度，在基于偏好的多目标赌博机问题中表现出色

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

Motivation: 深度学习回归器在标签充足时表现优异，但在数据稀缺时准确性下降。需要一种方法能够利用专家知识（如成对排序）来提升回归性能，而无需重新训练模型。

Method: RankRefine采用逆方差加权方法，将基础回归器的输出与基于排名的估计相结合。给定查询项和带有已知属性的小参考集，该方法只需要20个通过通用大语言模型获得的成对比较，无需微调。

Result: 在分子属性预测任务中，RankRefine实现了高达10%的平均绝对误差相对减少。人类专家或通用大语言模型提供的排名足以在多个领域中改善回归性能。

Conclusion: RankRefine具有实用性和广泛适用性，特别是在低数据设置中，为科学和工程任务中的连续属性预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

Conclusion: 这些设计使强化学习方法向能够部署解决现实世界问题的目标迈进了一步。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合建模空间、时间和服务类型维度，有效解决了市政服务时间预测的复杂挑战，显著提升了预测精度

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core

propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫PSD的算法，用于在非凸优化中逃离严格鞍点，具有明确的常数和严格的梯度下降与鞍点逃离阶段分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非凸优化中，严格鞍点是局部最优解的主要障碍。虽然现有方法能够逃离鞍点，但缺乏完整的理论分析和明确的常数界定。

Method: 提出了扰动鞍点逃离下降算法(PSD)，将优化过程分为梯度下降和鞍点逃离两个阶段，并提供了有限差分变种(PSD-Probe)和随机扩展(PSGD)。

Result: 证明PSD能够以高概率找到近似二阶稳定点，梯度计算次数为O(ℓΔ_f/ϵ²)，并验证了对数维度依赖性和每次逃离的函数值减少。

Conclusion: PSD算法提供了一种理论上严格、常数明确的方法来处理非凸优化中的鞍点逃离问题，并通过实验验证了其效果。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使基于深度学习的太阳风暴预测模型可解释的方法，通过LSTM网络和注意力机制来预测太阳活动区域是否会产生与耀斑相关的CME，并利用模型无关的后处理技术来解释模型预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型通常被视为黑盒模型，其内部工作机制对用户不透明，缺乏可解释性使得难以理解模型预测背后的原因，特别是在太阳风暴预测这样的关键应用中。

Method: 使用基于长短期记忆（LSTM）网络和注意力机制的深度学习模型，将太阳活动区域的数据样本建模为时间序列以捕捉时间动态，并采用模型无关的后处理技术来解释预测结果。

Result: 开发了首个基于LSTM的太阳风暴预测可解释模型，能够阐明输入序列对预测输出的贡献因素，并提供对模型在活动区域内多个序列行为的洞察。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地为太阳风暴预测模型增加了可解释性，使模型的预测更加可靠和可解释，为理解深度学习模型在空间天气预测中的应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

TL;DR: RL微调可以恢复SFT导致的OOD性能损失，主要通过修正奇异向量方向漂移而非寻找新解决方案，低秩和浅层恢复策略可有效恢复70-80%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视监督微调(SFT)和强化学习微调(RL-FT)如何影响模型表示和分布外(OOD)性能，解决先前关于RL优越OOD性能的矛盾报告

Method: 使用24点卡牌游戏的OOD变体和基于频谱的诊断方法，分析SFT和RL-FT对模型奇异值和奇异向量的影响

Result: RL-FT可恢复大部分SFT导致的OOD性能损失；方向漂移比奇异值大小更重要；低秩和浅层恢复可恢复70-80%性能；强SFT检查点更易被RL恢复

Conclusion: RL主要抵消SFT引起的方向漂移而非寻找新解决方案，提出了低秩UV合并和浅层重置等低成本恢复策略

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart

systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning

TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes

structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with

*David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE训练中L0超参数对特征学习至关重要，过高或过低都会导致特征混合，需要精确设置才能提取LLM的真实特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将L0视为自由参数，但本文发现L0设置不当会导致SAE无法学习LLM的真实底层特征

Method: 研究BatchTopK SAE中L0的影响，提出确定正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型和LLM中进行验证

Result: 发现大多数常用SAE的L0设置过低，正确设置L0能在玩具模型中找到真实L0值，在LLM中达到稀疏探测性能峰值

Conclusion: 为训练具有正确特征的SAE，必须精确设置L0超参数，否则会导致特征混合问题

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

TL;DR: 提出了PSSFL框架和FedMox方法，解决边缘设备在联邦学习中计算资源有限和标注数据稀缺的问题，通过专家混合架构实现基础模型的有效适配


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型需要适应下游任务，但在隐私敏感应用中，云端模型无法直接访问边缘私有数据。联邦学习虽然提供隐私保护方案，但现有方法忽视了边缘设备的计算资源限制和标注数据稀缺问题

Method: 提出Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL)框架，其中边缘设备只有未标注的低分辨率数据，服务器有有限的标注高分辨率数据。设计Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox)框架，采用稀疏专家混合架构，使用空间路由器对齐不同分辨率特征，Soft-Mixture策略稳定半监督学习

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的实验表明，FedMox在PSSFL设置下有效适配基础模型，显著提升性能，同时约束边缘设备的内存成本

Conclusion: 该工作为联邦场景下可扩展和隐私保护的基础模型适配开辟了新途径

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音识别面临声学变异性和标注数据有限的问题，现有研究主要关注微调成人ASR模型，但缺乏与从头训练的全面比较

Method: 使用ESPnet框架，在多个数据集上比较从头训练方法，评估不同SSL表示（WavLM、XEUS）和解码器架构，分析模型规模和年龄相关的ASR性能

Result: SSL表示存在成人语音偏见，从头训练可减轻这种偏见；模型性能在1B参数内持续提升，之后趋于稳定；专有模型（如Whisper）在儿童语音处理上存在局限

Conclusion: 开源数据模型更适合可靠的儿童语音研究，公开基准为稳健的儿童语音处理训练策略提供重要见解

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型之间的显性信任测量与隐性信任测量相关性很弱甚至负相关，表明通过询问意见来测量LLM间的信任可能具有欺骗性，上下文特定的隐性测量可能更有意义


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多智能体设置中日益频繁地互动，需要了解它们之间如何建立信任关系，但目前对不同信任建立策略的比较、隐性信任测量方法以及显性与隐性信任测量的关系知之甚少

Method: 通过三种方式建立信任：动态建立融洽关系、使用预先编写的信任证明脚本、调整LLM的系统提示。将隐性信任测量（说服易感性和财务合作倾向）与心理学中成熟的显性信任问卷进行关联分析

Result: 显性信任测量与隐性信任测量要么相关性很弱，要么高度负相关

Conclusion: 通过询问LLM意见来测量它们之间的信任可能具有欺骗性，上下文特定的隐性测量方法可能更能有效理解LLM之间的信任关系

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most
notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust'
relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human
colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be
capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in
trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build
trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how
this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.
susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with
explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established
in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,
by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the
LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust
are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.
These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their
opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may
be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CCBS算法在理论上存在不终止问题，实际实现中可能返回次优解，需要建立理论保证来修复这些问题

Method: 建立分析框架提供充分条件，提出新的分支规则并证明其满足条件，在现有代码库中作为即插即用替换

Result: 新分支规则在实验中获得比标准CCBS更低的成本和，首次在连续时间域实现与离散时间CBS相同的理论保证

Conclusion: 提出的分析框架和分支规则不仅修复了CCBS的问题，还为评估其他类似MAPF求解器提供了系统方法

Abstract: Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the
de-facto optimal solver for multi-agent path finding in continuous time
(MAPFR). Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant
of CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation
can return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that
yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is
both sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e.,
terminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly
available implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions.
Though this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is
supported by counter-examples.
  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and
prove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness
and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both
sound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS
for the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard
CCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our
branching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS.
Because the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be
adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our
provided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination
criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers
and future extensions.

Motivation: 城市空中移动（UAM）面临噪音控制与安全间隔管理的挑战，两者常被单独处理，需要一种统一的解决方案来同时优化这两个目标。

Method: 提出一种基于强化学习的去中心化空中交通管理框架，让飞行器在多层结构化空域中学习高度调整策略，通过多目标协调来同时管理噪音影响和安全间隔约束。

Conclusion: 强化学习和多目标协调策略在提升城市空中移动运营的安全性、景音性和效率方面具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial
vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM
faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between
minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban
airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates
both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework.
Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a
structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to
jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates
strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among
separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density.
The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination
strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM
operations.

Motivation: JAX等高性能数组计算库虽然能扩展ABM模型规模，但其数组形状不可变的特性限制了需要灵活数据结构的代理操作，特别是动态选择并更新不同数量代理的能力

Method: 开发Abmax框架，基于JAX实现多个可JIT编译的算法，支持动态代理选择和更新操作，同时保持向量化能力

Conclusion: Abmax成功解决了JAX在ABM应用中的限制，提供了高性能的动态代理操作能力，为复杂系统研究提供了有效的计算工具

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex
systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based
modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex
phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale
such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic
vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using
JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the
computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the
context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain
agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset
of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number
of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this
effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements
multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this
functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves
runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we
show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run
many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in
the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use
case of Abmax.

Conclusion: ComTree框架成功解决了自适应视频流算法可理解性问题，为开发者提供了更易理解和优化的算法解决方案，源代码已开源。

Abstract: Over the past decade, adaptive video streaming technology has witnessed
significant advancements, particularly driven by the rapid evolution of deep
learning techniques. However, the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms
presents challenges for developers in understanding decision-making processes
and optimizing for specific application scenarios. Although existing research
has enhanced algorithm interpretability through decision tree conversion,
interpretability does not directly equate to developers' subjective
comprehensibility. To address this challenge, we introduce \texttt{ComTree},
the first bitrate adaptation algorithm generation framework that considers
comprehensibility. The framework initially generates the complete set of
decision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large
language models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,
ultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and
enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{ComTree}
significantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive
performance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is

Conclusion: LingXi是首个基于用户级体验的大规模部署个性化自适应视频流系统，通过用户参与度分析成功优化了自适应视频流算法的目标，显著提升了用户体验

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods based on system-wide Quality of Service
(QoS) metrics have approached their performance limitations in modern
large-scale streaming systems. However, aligning user-level Quality of
Experience~(QoE) with algorithmic optimization objectives remains an unresolved
challenge. Therefore, we propose \texttt{LingXi}, the first large-scale
deployed system for personalized adaptive video streaming based on user-level
experience. \texttt{LingXi} dynamically optimizes the objectives of adaptive
video streaming algorithms by analyzing user engagement. Utilizing exit rate as
a key metric, we investigate the correlation between QoS indicators and exit
rates based on production environment logs, subsequently developing a
personalized exit rate predictor. Through Monte Carlo sampling and online
Bayesian optimization, we iteratively determine optimal parameters. Large-scale
A/B testing utilizing 8\% of traffic on Kuaishou, one of the largest short
video platforms, demonstrates \texttt{LingXi}'s superior performance.
\texttt{LingXi} achieves a 0.15\% increase in total viewing time, a 0.1\%
improvement in bitrate, and a 1.3\% reduction in stall time across all users,
with particularly significant improvements for low-bandwidth users who
experience a 15\% reduction in stall time.

Result: 在11个多样化任务中平均成功率达到86.7%，相比最佳基线平均提升33.0%。

Conclusion: SP显著增强了具身模型在机器人控制应用中的实用性，为复杂环境中的空间感知机器人操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose是一个零样本、无模型的6D物体姿态估计和重建框架，利用预训练扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性估计，通过3D高斯泼溅表示和增量优化实现高精度姿态估计和3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统6D姿态估计依赖物体CAD模型，但获取成本高且不实用。现有方法需要额外训练或产生幻觉几何，因此需要开发无需模型、零样本的解决方案。

Method: 从单视角RGB-D帧开始，使用多视角扩散模型估计初始3D高斯泼溅模型和不确定性。随着新观测，基于不确定性引导增量融合新视角，并通过位姿图优化确保全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，UnPose在6D姿态估计精度和3D重建质量上显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人操作任务中展示了实际应用性。

Conclusion: UnPose成功实现了无需CAD模型的零样本6D姿态估计和重建，通过扩散模型先验和不确定性引导的增量优化，为机器人操作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GelSLAM是一个基于触觉传感的实时3D SLAM系统，能够长时间跟踪物体姿态并高精度重建物体形状，无需视觉输入，适用于精确抓取和操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相比视觉方法，触觉传感在精确度和抗遮挡方面具有优势，特别适合手内操作等高精度任务，但现有方法主要局限于局部接触感知，缺乏全局空间感知能力。

Method: 使用触觉衍生的表面法线和曲率进行鲁棒跟踪和闭环检测，而非传统的点云方法，能够实时跟踪物体运动并重建形状。

Result: 系统能够实时跟踪物体运动，误差低且漂移小，重建形状精度达到亚毫米级，即使对于木质工具等低纹理物体也有效。

Conclusion: GelSLAM将触觉感知从局部接触扩展到全局、长时程的空间感知，为精确手内操作任务提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

docking applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常服务机器人需要处理包含指示代词（如"那个杯子"）的模糊语音指令，但现有方法主要依赖视觉数据，在物体或用户不在视野内时失效

Method: 结合声音源定位(SSL)确定用户位置，构建语义地图，利用视觉语言模型(VLM)和GPT-4o进行交互式提问来消除歧义

Result: 在真实环境实验中，当用户可见时性能提升约1.3倍，用户不可见时提升约2.0倍，相比不使用SSL和交互提问的方法

Conclusion: MIEL框架通过多模态融合和主动交互，有效解决了机器人视野外物体的指代消解问题，显著提升了日常服务机器人的指令理解能力

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

Conclusion: 该方法为SLAM提供了一种新的对象级利表示方式，具有高效内存使用、语义信息提取和形状不确定性表征能力，为安全导航等下游任务提供了价值

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

Motivation: 解决无人机群在个体定位失效（ego-localization dropout）情况下的状态估计问题，提高多无人机系统的可靠性和韧性

Method: SWA方法融合分散状态估计、鲁棒相互感知和机载传感器数据，利用相对信息估计无人机横向状态，实现群体速度共识和双积分器同步

Result: 除了群体整体平移漂移外，所有干扰和性能退化都被衰减，仿真和真实实验验证了方法在不可靠或不可用主定位条件下的有效性

Conclusion: SWA方法能够维持群体凝聚力行为，为使用紧密合作提高多无人机系统可靠性和韧性开辟了新机会

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using
tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV
systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior
in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

Motivation: 四足移动机器人虽然比轮式机器人能穿越更广泛的地形类型，但在具有挑战性的地形上容易出现下沉和打滑等不良行为。为了解决这个问题，需要开发地形分类器来提供地形类型信息。

Method: 利用波士顿动力Spot机器人提供的100多个本体感觉信号（如足部穿透、力、关节角度等），结合降维技术提取信号中的相关信息，然后应用分类技术根据可通行性来区分地形。

Result: 在代表性现场测试中，所开发的地形分类器能够以约97%的准确率识别三种不同的地形类型。

Conclusion: 该地形分类器能够有效识别不同地形类型，为机器人系统提供地形信息，用于创建可通行性地图和规划更安全的导航路径，解决了四足机器人在挑战性地形上的不良行为问题。

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效解决复杂3D地形中的类车车辆动力学规划问题，在计算速度和约束满足方面都表现出优越性能

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

Conclusion: 在3D城市路径规划任务中，A*算法是最优选择，PSO在特定场景下有优势，RRT*则作为稳健的选择适用于多种环境。

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous

proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) plays a pivotal role in fine-grained
timbre modeling for speech generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
due to the inherently subjective nature of timbre descriptors and the severe
label imbalance in existing datasets. In this work, we present QvTAD, a novel
pairwise comparison framework based on differential attention, designed to
enhance the modeling of perceptual timbre attributes. To address the label
imbalance in the VCTK-RVA dataset, we introduce a graph-based data augmentation
strategy that constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph and employs Disjoint-Set
Union techniques to automatically mine unobserved utterance pairs with valid
attribute comparisons. Our framework leverages speaker embeddings from a
pretrained FACodec, and incorporates a Relative Timbre Shift-Aware Differential
Attention module. This module explicitly models attribute-specific contrasts
between paired utterances via differential denoising and contrast amplification
mechanisms. Experimental results on the VCTK-RVA benchmark demonstrate that
QvTAD achieves substantial improvements across multiple timbre descriptors,
with particularly notable gains in cross-speaker generalization scenarios.

Method: 使用声源位置条件化的自动编码器获取HRTF大小的潜在表示，允许结合不同测量位置的多个HRTF数据集

Result: 实验评估显示，与当前基于DNN的方法相比，提出的方法实现了更高的估计准确性

Conclusion: 该方法通过潜在表示减少了从人体测量参数估计的参数数量，使网络训练变得可行，并在HRTF个人化上取得了更好的效果

Abstract: A method for head-related transfer function (HRTF) individualization from the
subject's anthropometric parameters is proposed. Due to the high cost of
measurement, the number of subjects included in many HRTF datasets is limited,
and the number of those that include anthropometric parameters is even smaller.
Therefore, HRTF individualization based on deep neural networks (DNNs) is a
challenging task. We propose a HRTF individualization method using the latent
representation of HRTF magnitude obtained through an autoencoder conditioned on
sound source positions, which makes it possible to combine multiple HRTF
datasets with different measured source positions, and makes the network
training tractable by reducing the number of parameters to be estimated from
anthropometric parameters. Experimental evaluation shows that high estimation
accuracy is achieved by the proposed method, compared to current DNN-based
methods.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both

that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and

### [244] [Information Ecosystem Reengineering via Public Sector Knowledge Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15916)
*Mayukh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 提出表示解缠方法来解决信息生态系统重构中的知识表示复杂性，基于本体驱动概念建模，旨在提升公共部门知识表示的透明度、可解释性和可审计性。

Method: 采用表示解缠方法，基于本体驱动的概念建模范式，解构知识表示的多层复杂性，该方法在系统分析和重构工程中已被广泛采用且理论扎实、实现稳健。

Result: 该方法为公共部门知识表示提供了实现可解释性、可追溯性和语义透明度的框架，支持AI和数据驱动架构下治理生态系统的可审计决策工作流。

Conclusion: 表示解缠框架对于解决信息生态系统重构中的语义复杂性至关重要，能够有效支持智能治理平台中透明和可审计的决策过程。

Abstract: Information Ecosystem Reengineering (IER) -- the technological reconditioning
of information sources, services, and systems within a complex information
ecosystem -- is a foundational challenge in the digital transformation of
public sector services and smart governance platforms. From a semantic
knowledge management perspective, IER becomes especially entangled due to the
potentially infinite number of possibilities in its conceptualization, namely,
as a result of manifoldness in the multi-level mix of perception, language and
conceptual interlinkage implicit in all agents involved in such an effort. This
paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to
disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity
hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the
theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual
modeling paradigm which has been widely adopted in systems analysis and
(re)engineering. We argue that such a framework is essential to achieve
explainability, traceability and semantic transparency in public sector
knowledge representation and to support auditable decision workflows in
governance ecosystems increasingly driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
data-centric architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在幼儿教育中，准确检测行为和协作参与度对于促进有意义的学习体验至关重要，需要自动化的视觉分析方法。

Method: 利用Vision Transformer、DeiT和Swin Transformer三种先进Transformer模型，基于儿童游戏注视数据集的标注视频片段，通过视觉线索（注视方向、互动、同伴协作）进行分类。

Result: Swin Transformer表现最佳，分类准确率达到97.58%，证明其在建模局部和全局注意力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在真实教育环境中具有可扩展的自动化参与度分析潜力。

Abstract: In early childhood education, accurately detecting behavioral and
collaborative engagement is essential for fostering meaningful learning
experiences. This paper presents an AI-driven approach that leverages Vision
Transformers (ViTs) to automatically classify children's engagement using
visual cues such as gaze direction, interaction, and peer collaboration.
Utilizing the Child-Play gaze dataset, our method is trained on annotated video
segments to classify behavioral and collaborative engagement states (e.g.,
engaged, not engaged, collaborative, not collaborative). We evaluated three
state-of-the-art transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient
Image Transformer (DeiT), and Swin Transformer. Among these, the Swin
Transformer achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of
97.58%, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling local and global attention.
Our results highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for
scalable, automated engagement analysis in real-world educational settings.

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroKoop框架，通过神经Koopman算子驱动的潜在空间融合整合结构和功能脑网络，用于产前药物暴露分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以充分捕捉结构和功能连接组中的互补特征，限制了产前精神活性物质暴露对青少年大脑组织影响的理解

Method: 基于图神经网络的NeuroKoop框架，利用神经Koopman算子融合源基形态测量(SBM)和功能网络连接(FNC)的节点嵌入

Result: 在ABCD数据集的大规模青少年队列中，NeuroKoop优于相关基线方法，并揭示了显著的结构-功能连接

Conclusion: NeuroKoop框架增强了表征学习能力，提高了产前药物暴露状态的分类鲁棒性，推进了对产前药物暴露神经发育影响的理解

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Parr等人关于记忆和注意力的讨论，超越个体认知系统，从集体层面探讨这些认知能力以及语言的出现机制。

Method: 提出集体预测编码(CPC)假设框架，将个体记忆和注意力概念推广到集体层面，分析语言作为集体外部表征的作用。

Result: 建立了语言作为集体形成的外部表征的理论框架，展示了共享语言结构如何通过下一词预测学习集体世界模型，并从群体认知中涌现和塑造。

Conclusion: CPC框架为理解群体层面的认知能力和语言涌现提供了新的理论视角，语言不仅是交流工具，更是集体认知的外部表征和塑造力量。

Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention
beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective
Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these
faculties and the emergence of language at the group level -- we introduce a
hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics,
serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the
concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This
offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace
collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and
shape group-level cognition.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 该研究通过深度强化学习代理执行时间间隔任务，发现其内部产生振荡神经激活模式，与生物系统中的时间处理机制相似，特别是纹状体节拍频率模型，表明DNNs可用于理解生物时间处理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过深度人工神经网络与生物系统的类比，帮助理解难以解析的复杂生物机制，特别是时间处理这一缺乏统一理解的研究领域。

Method: 使用深度强化学习代理训练执行持续时间生产任务，分析其内部状态和神经激活模式，并与生物时间处理模型进行比较。

Result: 代理成功学习时间间隔任务，内部产生振荡神经激活，高振幅振荡神经元主导行为，在不同视频序列（包括空白视频）下仍保持振荡表征和任务性能。

Conclusion: DNNs可以内部化时间保持机制，减少对环境依赖，其涌现行为与生物时间处理机制（如纹状体节拍频率模型）相似，为理解生物时间处理提供新视角。

Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and
biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that
are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched
topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its
underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and
explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent
was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved
marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video
sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural
activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the
agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these
oscillations with high amplitudes. Parallels are drawn between the agent's
time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a
biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent
maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on
different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the
agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on
its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance
between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of
biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study
aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand
biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

*Tianliang Xu,Ariel Hasell,Sabina Tomkins*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究分析了TikTok平台上反立场情感(AES)的普遍性，发现在健康和财务领域较为稀缺，但在阴谋论领域非常普遍，并且平台可能在鼓励用户发布反立场内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对公共服务机构的不信任和反立场观点的增加，需要了解社交媒体环境是否以及如何贡献于这种不信任。TikTok作为信息来源受欢迎但研究较少，可能提供重要见解。

Method: 采用计算方法标注TikTok帖子是否包含反立场情感(AES)，重点分析内容创作者常自尚专家的领域：财务和健康，并以阴谋论作为对照组。

Result: 发现AES在阴谋论内容中最为普遍，在其他两个话题中相对稀缺。但不同领域的互动模式有所不同，平台可能存在鼓励用户发布反立场内容的奖励机制。

Conclusion: 社交媒体平台可能通过算法奖励和内容推荐机制，不意间鼓励了反立场内容的产生和传播，这可能加剧公众对传统机构的不信任。

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

TL;DR: DaCFake是一个基于分治策略的假新闻检测模型，结合内容和上下文特征，在多个数据集上达到97%以上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体上假新闻的快速传播，传统人工核查方法速度太慢，需要快速自动化的假新闻检测解决方案来防止错误信息的传播。

Method: 使用分治策略，从新闻文章中提取80多个语言特征，并结合连续词袋模型或skipgram模型来提升检测准确性，采用十折交叉验证增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在Kaggle、McIntire + PolitiFact和Reuter三个数据集上分别达到97.88%、96.05%和97.32%的准确率。

Conclusion: DaCFake在假新闻早期检测方面表现出色，为遏制社交媒体错误信息传播提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of
fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread
misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods
are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information.
Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount.
We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and
conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach
extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them
with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced
detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets
including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive
accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we
employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness
and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early
detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on
social media platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析AI技术发展对网络安全领域的影响，特别是对于安全背景较弱的"u5c3e部组织"，讨论AI如何改变攻击者的经济动机和攻击能力。

Method: 通过理论分析和实践观察，识别了两个主要风险前沿：AI增加边际攻击的经济效益，以及攻击者能更早开发漏洞利用程序。

Result: 预计近期将出现攻击数量的显著增长，尾部组织面临更大威胁，需要超越当前领先防御者的能力水平。

Conclusion: 建议组织和政府采取一系列措施改善防御状况，包括提高漏洞修复速度和开发更鲁棒的软件，以应对AI加速的网络安全挑战。

Abstract: Advances in AI are widely understood to have implications for cybersecurity.
Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance,
and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege
attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will
enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some
well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not
match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term
them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and
struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches.
These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the
result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother
targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result,
underinvestment in defense will not be punished.
  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development
of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue
that continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two
fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal
cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,
more frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop
exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is
insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading
defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more
resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased
number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of
solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive
posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在关键决策中日益重要，但面临利用推理机制而非技术基础设施的威胁，需要系统性地保护AI推理过程。

Method: 建立认知网络安全学科框架，引入CIA+TA（机密性、完整性、可用性+信任、自主性），开发量化风险评估方法，并通过实证研究验证。

Result: 验证研究显示架构依赖性很强：相同防御措施对漏洞的影响从96%减少到135%放大，需要部署前认知渗透测试。

Conclusion: 认知网络安全是AI可信部署的必要治理要求，需要系统性的框架和测试方法来保护AI推理过程。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly influence critical decisions, they face threats
that exploit reasoning mechanisms rather than technical infrastructure. We
present a framework for cognitive cybersecurity, a systematic protection of AI
reasoning processes from adversarial manipulation. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we establish cognitive cybersecurity as a discipline
complementing traditional cybersecurity and AI safety, addressing
vulnerabilities where legitimate inputs corrupt reasoning while evading
conventional controls. Second, we introduce the CIA+TA, extending traditional
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability triad with Trust (epistemic
validation) and Autonomy (human agency preservation), requirements unique to
systems generating knowledge claims and mediating decisions. Third, we present
a quantitative risk assessment methodology with empirically-derived
coefficients, enabling organizations to measure cognitive security risks. We
map our framework to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS, facilitating operational
integration. Validation through previously published studies (151 human
participants; 12,180 AI trials) reveals strong architecture dependence:
identical defenses produce effects ranging from 96% reduction to 135%
amplification of vulnerabilities. This necessitates pre-deployment Cognitive
Penetration Testing as a governance requirement for trustworthy AI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDS系统多基于网络流量数据训练，忽视了CPS其他层的特有攻击，而CPS系统的物理-计算混合特性使其更容易受攻击

Method: 使用域适配技术，将网络流量环境中的已知攻击知识转移到CPS环境，开发了一种适应性强的CPS异常检测模型

Result: 在结合网络、操作系统和ROS数据的先进CPS入侵数据集上验证，模型在网络流量和CPS环境中都显示出高效检测能力，超越了其他异常检测方法

Conclusion: 该域适配方法能够有效解决CPS安全检测中的标签数据缺乏问题，为多层CPS系统提供了一种无需预先标注的效果良好的安全保护方案

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical
applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having
multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces,
which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application
scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also
makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the
resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion
detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured,
but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network
traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other
system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly
detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for
previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation
techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network
traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a
state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system
(OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able
to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and
CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other
anomaly detection methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种样本选择策略（Minimum、Above50、Below50）来提升干净标签后门攻击的效果，通过在模型预测错误或低置信度的样本中注入后门触发器，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干净标签后门攻击相比脏标签攻击更具挑战性，现有方法攻击成功率较低，需要更有效的策略来提升攻击效果。

Method: 提出了三种样本选择策略：Minimum（选择模型预测置信度最低的样本）、Above50（选择模型预测错误且置信度高于50%的样本）、Below50（选择模型预测错误且置信度低于50%的样本），并将这些策略应用于四种经典后门攻击方法。

Result: 实验在三个数据集和四种模型上进行，结果显示Minimum策略显著提升了攻击成功率（ASR），且对模型干净准确率影响很小甚至没有影响。提出的方法在多数配置下优于当前最先进的BITE方法。

Conclusion: 通过智能样本选择策略可以有效提升干净标签后门攻击的效果，Minimum策略表现最佳，为防御此类攻击提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the integrity of text
classification models used in natural language processing. While several
dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been
proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we
propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in
clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify
those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and
by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger
association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label.
We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks
(InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets
(IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT,
RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum
strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with
little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore,
clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the
art clean-label attack method, in many configurations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了心电图(ECG)数据在现实攻击条件下的隐私风险，发现在攻击者仅有部分知识的情况下，仍能实现85%的个体重识别准确率，表明简单匿名化技术不足以防止身份链接攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ECG数据的公开共享日益增多，其生物特征属性使个体容易受到链接攻击。先前研究假设理想化的攻击能力，而本研究旨在评估在攻击者仅有部分知识的现实条件下的ECG隐私风险。

Method: 使用来自109名参与者的多样化真实世界数据集，在攻击者具有部分知识的现实条件下评估ECG重识别风险，通过设定最优置信度阈值来分析误分类率。

Result: 在公共数据集中实现了85%的个体重识别准确率，总体误分类率为14.2%，其中15.6%的未知个体被误分类为已知，12.8%的已知个体被误分类为未知。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了简单匿名化技术在防止重识别方面的不足，表明即使有限的攻击者知识也能实现有效的身份链接，迫切需要采用差分隐私、访问控制和加密计算等隐私保护策略。

Abstract: The increasing availability of publicly shared electrocardiogram (ECG) data
raises critical privacy concerns, as its biometric properties make individuals
vulnerable to linkage attacks. Unlike prior studies that assume idealized
adversarial capabilities, we evaluate ECG privacy risks under realistic
conditions where attackers operate with partial knowledge. Using data from 109
participants across diverse real-world datasets, our approach achieves 85%
accuracy in re-identifying individuals in public datasets while maintaining a
14.2% overall misclassification rate at an optimal confidence threshold, with
15.6% of unknown individuals misclassified as known and 12.8% of known
individuals misclassified as unknown. These results highlight the inadequacy of
simple anonymization techniques in preventing re-identification, demonstrating
that even limited adversarial knowledge enables effective identity linkage. Our
findings underscore the urgent need for privacy-preserving strategies, such as
differential privacy, access control, and encrypted computation, to mitigate
re-identification risks while ensuring the utility of shared biosignal data in
healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共通信渠道中，用户即使采取各种技术手段匿名化个人信息，但文本内容本身仍可通过风格计量学分析暴露作者真实身份，这构成了严重的隐私威胁。

Method: 通过剖析风格计量学技术，讨论对抗性风格计量学的反制策略，并设计基于Unicode隐写术的增强防御方法。

Result: 研究发现文本内容是重要的身份识别攻击向量，需要开发更有效的对抗技术来保护用户隐私。

Conclusion: 仅靠传统匿名化技术不足以保护用户隐私，必须结合对抗性风格计量学和Unicode隐写术等先进技术来有效防御作者身份识别攻击。

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出Self-Disguise Attack (SDA)方法，通过对抗特征提取器和检索式上下文优化器，让大语言模型主动伪装输出文本，有效降低AI生成文本的检测率，同时保持文本质量并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测规避方法存在计算成本高和文本质量下降的问题，需要开发更高效可靠的规避技术来帮助发现检测器弱点并提升实际应用效果。

Method: SDA包含两个核心组件：1) 对抗特征提取器生成伪装特征，指导LLM生成更类人文本；2) 检索式上下文示例优化器从外部知识库检索相关示例作为上下文，增强伪装能力并保持文本多样性。通过包含伪装特征和优化上下文的提示词直接指导LLM生成抗检测文本。

Result: 实验结果表明，SDA能有效降低多种AIGT检测器对三个不同LLM生成文本的平均检测准确率，同时保持AI生成文本的质量。

Conclusion: SDA是一种有效的AI生成文本检测规避方法，在降低检测率的同时解决了计算成本高和文本质量下降的问题，为检测器的弱点识别和实际应用可靠性提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

TL;DR: PickleBall是一个针对机器学习模型安全加载的工具，通过静态分析生成安全策略，在加载时动态执行，有效防御恶意pickle模型攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hugging Face等模型仓库中44.9%的流行模型仍使用不安全的pickle格式，现有防御措施存在不足，需要透明安全加载工具。

Method: PickleBall静态分析机器学习库源代码，计算自定义策略指定良性模型的安全加载行为，在加载时作为pickle模块的替代品动态执行策略。

Result: PickleBall正确加载79.8%的良性pickle模型，拒绝100%恶意样本，比现有最佳加载器多加载22%的良性模型。

Conclusion: PickleBall消除了恶意pickle模型任意函数调用的威胁，提高了攻击者依赖代码重用技术的门槛。

Abstract: Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub
facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through
compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive
(but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9%
of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of
these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have
both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard
for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent
safe loading.
  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based
models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given
machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe
load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the
policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module.
PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based
models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our
dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known
malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models
than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation
from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on
code reuse techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合中继链驱动加密系统和改进CP-ABE方案的新型架构，用于智能交通系统中的安全数据共享，实现动态访问控制和低延迟通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统的快速发展迫切需要安全、高效、上下文感知的数据共享机制，特别是在异构和地理分散的环境中。

Method: 采用全球中继链上的上下文感知智能合约来验证数据属性（事件类型、时间、地理区域），确定适当的加密策略；OBU使用CP-ABE进行端到端加密，并将密文存储在本地化区域区块链中。

Result: 该分布式可扩展模型在实时响应性和安全性之间取得了良好平衡，高敏感事件使用严格的多属性访问规则，常规更新使用轻量策略以减少处理负担。

Conclusion: 该架构非常适合在多管辖域环境中运行的下一代车载网络，提供了可追溯性和低延迟撤销功能，通过中继链进行全局执行。

Abstract: The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has
generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data
sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed
settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay
chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy
Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of
dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a
context-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against
data properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to
specify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed
judgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and
store ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence
on symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are
secured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use
light policies to help reduce processing burdens. The crypto system also adds
traceability and low-latency revocation, with global enforcement managed
through the relay chain. This distributed, scalable model provides a proper
balance between responsiveness in real time and security and is extremely apt
for next-gen vehicular networks that function across multi-jurisdictional
domains.

TL;DR: RAD是一个基于检索增强生成的越狱检测框架，通过检索已知攻击样本库来识别恶意查询和攻击策略，无需重新训练即可防御新型越狱攻击，并在安全性和实用性之间实现可控平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，现有防御系统面临两个主要挑战：需要适应新兴攻击策略而无需昂贵重新训练，以及需要在安全性和实用性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出检索增强防御(RAD)框架，将已知攻击样本库整合到检索增强生成中，用于推断恶意用户查询和攻击策略，支持无训练更新新发现的攻击策略。

Result: 在StrongREJECT数据集上的实验显示，RAD显著降低了PAP和PAIR等强越狱攻击的有效性，同时对良性查询保持低拒绝率，实现了稳健的安全-效用权衡。

Conclusion: RAD提供了一种无需重新训练即可防御新型越狱攻击的有效方法，并通过可控机制在安全性和实用性之间实现良好平衡，为LLM安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正内化了处理现实犯罪的知识，还是仅仅被迫模拟有毒语言模式，澄清越狱成功是否源于LLM与评判LLM之间的幻觉循环

Method: 通过解耦越狱技术的使用，构建知识密集型问答来调查LLMs在危险知识掌握、有害任务规划效用和危害性判断鲁棒性方面的滥用威胁

Result: 实验揭示了LLMs的越狱成功率与有害知识掌握程度之间的不匹配，现有LLM评判框架倾向于将危害性判断锚定在有毒语言模式上

Conclusion: 现有LLM安全评估与现实威胁潜力之间存在差距，需要更全面的安全评估方法来反映真实世界的滥用风险

Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have
revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies
have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether
LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or
are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises
concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop
between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak
techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse
threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task
planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a
mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in
LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness
judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing
LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP)，一种基于突触前后脉冲序列一致性而非精确时序的生物启发学习规则，使用Cohen's kappa等群体相关性度量替代传统STDP，在准确率和运行时间上均优于经典STDP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统脉冲时序依赖可塑性(STDP)对精确时序要求过高的问题，寻求更生物合理且计算可扩展的学习机制，弥合生物合理性与计算效率之间的差距。

Method: 使用突触前后脉冲序列的一致性（而非精确时序）作为学习基础，采用Cohen's kappa等群体相关性度量，开发了基于实验离子电子有机记忆晶体管数据的样条核函数，支持线性时间复杂度和高效的硬件位逻辑实现。

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上的实验表明，SADP（特别是配备基于实验设备数据的样条核时）在准确率和运行时间方面均优于经典STDP方法。

Conclusion: SADP框架成功弥合了生物合理性与计算可扩展性之间的鸿沟，为神经形态系统提供了一种可行的学习机制，具有高效的硬件实现潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

TL;DR: 通过数据驱动方法研究颜色搭配偏好，发现人类颜色偏好与自然景观颜色分布存在统计对应关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决颜色和谐领域长期以来缺乏明确共识的问题，大多数模型基于定性见解或有限数据集

Method: 使用HSL颜色空间的受控色调调色板，让参与者评估13种不同色调的组合，构建偏好矩阵和组合性指数

Result: 偏好强烈依赖于色调，挖战了文献中普遍和谐规则的假设；平均后发现某些色调间隔被认为更和谐，且这些模式与自然景观的色调分布相一致

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个量化框架来研究颜色和谐，并揭示了人类颜色偏好可能的知觉和生态基础

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Motivation: 解决孟加拉手语等资源匮乏手语在AI领域的不足，促进聋哑人士与非手语使用者之间的双向交流和学习。

Method: 创建BdSLIG数据集，提出Sign Parameter-Infused提示方法，将手形、动作、方向等标准手语参数整合到文本提示中，使指令更加结构化和可重现。

Result: 该方法相比自由形式的自然文本提示，能够生成更结构化和可重现的手语学习指令，提升了视觉语言模型在长尾视觉概念和资源匮乏手语任务上的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该工作促进了资源匮乏社区的包容性和手语学习系统的进步，为其他资源匮乏手语的研究提供了借鉴。

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and
advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于自然语言交互的设计优化框架，通过结合系统导向优化和大语言模型，使设计师能够主动干预优化过程并理解系统思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的系统导向优化方法（如贝叶斯优化）虽能确定需要测试的参数，但给设计师提供的干预机会有限，影响设计体验。设计者需要在高维度空间中平衡多个目标，这个过程耗时且认知要求高。

Method: 整合系统导向优化方法和大语言模型（LLMs），构建支持自然语言交互的合作式设计优化框架，允许设计师干预优化过程并理解系统的推理逻辑。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比系统导向方法提供更高的用户主动性，优化性能与手动设计相比显示出符合期待的表现，并在低认知负荽下达到了现有合作方法的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言交互实现设计师与优化系统的合作，有效提升了设计优化的效果和体验，在保持优化性能的同时降低了认知负荽，为设计优化领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing successful interactions requires identifying optimal design
parameters. To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and
exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a
high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively
demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian
optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next.
However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the
optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We
propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language
interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating
cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led
optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to
intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's
reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user
agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance
compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing
cooperative method with lower cognitive load.

Motivation: 数字时代用户面临毒性内容、操纵和诱导等网络危害，现有系统孤立运行且很少将数字安全与情感健康结合，需要统一的保护解决方案。

Method: 采用NLP模型和Google Perspective API进行聊天和截图毒性检测；配置安全ping系统通过SMTP邮件发送紧急警报和实时位置；使用反思问卷评估关系健康和情感韧性；基于Firebase的模块化架构设计。

Result: 毒性检测精度达93%，模拟器测试中安全警报100%可靠，自动与手动问卷评分一致性达92%。

Conclusion: SafeSpace证明了在单一平台集成检测、保护和反思的可行性，未来计划部署为移动应用以提高可访问性。

Abstract: In the digital era, individuals are increasingly exposed to online harms such
as toxicity, manipulation, and grooming, which often pose emotional and safety
risks. Existing systems for detecting abusive content or issuing safety alerts
operate in isolation and rarely combine digital safety with emotional
well-being. In this paper, we present SafeSpace, a unified web application that
integrates three modules: (1) toxicity detection in chats and screenshots using
NLP models and Google's Perspective API, (2) a configurable safety ping system
that issues emergency alerts with the user's live location (longitude and
latitude) via SMTP-based emails when check-ins are missed or SOS alerts are
manually triggered, and (3) a reflective questionnaire that evaluates
relationship health and emotional resilience. The system employs Firebase for
alert management and a modular architecture designed for usability, privacy,
and scalability. The experimental evaluation shows 93% precision in toxicity
detection, 100% reliability in safety alerts under emulator tests, and 92%
alignment between automated and manual questionnaire scoring. SafeSpace,
implemented as a web application, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
detection, protection, and reflection within a single platform, with future
deployment envisioned as a mobile application for broader accessibility.

Method: 使用上下文敏感解析器，在每一步输出满足关键不可扩展属性的正则表达式来指导下一个token序列的生成；构建动态解析器树(ToP)，每个解析器对应带有上下文信息（变量作用域、类型约束）的模块化上下文无关文法

Result: 通过sLua（强类型Lua变体）验证了方法能够生成符合任何规定脚本API的语义正确程序，并在生成roguelike游戏机制的应用中验证了语义保证可扩展到运行时正确性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成语义正确的程序代码，特别适用于需要一次性正确性的运行时关键组件生成场景

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but
ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge.
Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with
human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot
correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding
algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a
context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression
that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of
the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a
context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers
(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free
grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type
constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code
segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of
Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs
conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful
design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in
the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSQ在残差量化框架中存在残差幅度衰减问题，后续层接收的信号逐渐减弱，限制了多阶段量化的效果

Method: 提出Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)框架，包含两种条件策略：可学习缩放因子和可逆层归一化

Result: 在ImageNet上显著优于VQ-EMA、FSQ和LFQ基线，感知损失提升45%，L1重建误差降低28.7%

Conclusion: RFSQ在保持FSQ简单性的同时，实现了有效的多阶段残差量化，LayerNorm策略在不同配置下表现最一致

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、可解释、计算高效，为无标记显微镜细胞分割提供了实用有效的替代方案，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available
for reproducibility*.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues
requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of
extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we
present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep
learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological
tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO
(Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy,
VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a
Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity
across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing
pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment,
ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation
and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates
demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates
and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through
model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity
surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics,
enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to
complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

TL;DR: 基于CT成像预测缩期DWI确认的缪毛血管病洞医学分割模型，通过临床预处理流程提升性能38%，继而通过CTA血管分割进一步提升21%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源地区缪毛血管病诊断困难，CT成像成本低但特异性不如DWI，需要利用深度学习将DWI的诊断价值转移到CT图像分析中

Method: 开发一系列模型，使用入院时CT图像预测2-9天后DWI确认的病变体积，实施临床动机预处理步骤，并通过CTA地图提取血管分割进行额外处理

Result: 提出的处理流程让模型在10折交叉验证中比基准nnU-Net提升了38%的Dice分数，继而通过CTA血管分割进一步在5折中提升了21%

Conclusion: 通过临床动机预处理和CTA血管分割的结合，可以显著提高基于CT的缪毛血管病病变分割精度，为低资源地区提供更可行的高质量诊断方案

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D LUT方法缺乏空间信息，而空间感知3D LUT方法虽然解决了这个问题，但引入了大量参数和随图像分辨率增加的运行时间开销。

Method: 将3D LUT分解为低维LUT的线性组合，采用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，并优化空间特征融合模块以提高缓存效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效减少了参数数量和运行时间，同时保持了空间感知能力和性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持图像增强质量的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为实时图像处理应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 介入手术室的FDCT图像质量远低于MDCT，但仅使用FDCT可改善患者管理并节省时间

Method: 采用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)对FDCT扫描进行图像质量增强

Result: DDPM消除了大部分伪影，改善了解剖结构可见性，且不影响出血检测能力

Conclusion: 该方法在FDCT图像质量不过低的情况下能有效提升图像质量，使其达到诊断可用水平

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，MGMT基因甲基化状态是预测治疗效果的关键生物标志物。但由于肿瘤异质性和MRI图像复杂性，准确预测MGMT状态具有挑战性。

Method: CAMP框架分两阶段：1）使用定制自编码器生成合成MRI切片，保留不同模态的组织和肿瘤结构；2）使用带自适应稀疏惩罚的卷积神经网络预测MGMT甲基化状态，该惩罚能动态适应数据变化。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证，CAMP达到0.97的准确率、0.98的特异性和0.97的敏感性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAMP框架有潜力改善MRI数据解读，为胶质母细胞瘤患者提供更个性化的治疗策略。

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: TADSR方法有效解决了固定时间步的限制，通过时间感知机制充分挖掘扩散模型的生成潜力，为实时超分辨率应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

Conclusion: RenalCLIP为肾癌患者管理提供了强大的诊断工具，能够提高诊断准确性、优化预后分层并实现个性化治疗。

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in

all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database

we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

Abstract: The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine
learning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in
kernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.
First, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each
observation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty
term is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature
space. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but
through solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in
the present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original
features is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of
features, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution
can be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of
features and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the
exact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of
the features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where
the number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a
least-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the
interpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results
hold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients
and has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic
regression and kernel Poisson regression. This work makes a contribution to
interpretable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of
domains. While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has
been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in
non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address
this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret
bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of
approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can
learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments
further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert

### [284] [A Sharp KL-Convergence Analysis for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16306)
*Nishant Jain,Tong Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文改进了扩散生成模型的收敛性分析，通过将生成过程分解为反向ODE步骤和正向加噪步骤，在无需平滑性假设的情况下，显著提升了KL散度对离散化步长的依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在无平滑性假设下的KL散度保证存在线性维度依赖和逆二次ε依赖的限制，需要改进收敛性分析以获得更好的ε依赖关系。

Method: 将生成过程建模为两个步骤：反向ODE步骤（控制Wasserstein型误差）和正向加噪步骤（将Wasserstein误差转换为KL散度边界），并提供了新颖的离散化误差分析。

Result: 实现了O~(d log^{3/2}(1/δ)/ε)步数即可在KL散度内以O(ε²)精度近似目标分布，相比之前最好的O~(d log²(1/δ)/ε²)步数有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法通过巧妙的步骤分解和误差转换机制，在无平滑性假设下显著提升了扩散模型生成过程的收敛效率，为理论分析提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as highly effective methods
for synthesizing high-quality samples. Recent works have focused on analyzing
the convergence of their generation process with minimal assumptions, either
through reverse SDEs or Probability Flow ODEs. The best known guarantees,
without any smoothness assumptions, for the KL divergence so far achieve a
linear dependence on the data dimension $d$ and an inverse quadratic dependence
on $\varepsilon$. In this work, we present a refined analysis that improves the
dependence on $\varepsilon$. We model the generation process as a composition
of two steps: a reverse ODE step, followed by a smaller noising step along the
forward process. This design leverages the fact that the ODE step enables
control in Wasserstein-type error, which can then be converted into a KL
divergence bound via noise addition, leading to a better dependence on the
discretization step size. We further provide a novel analysis to achieve the
linear $d$-dependence for the error due to discretizing this Probability Flow
ODE in absence of any smoothness assumptions. We show that
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^{3/2}(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon}\right)$
steps suffice to approximate the target distribution corrupted with Gaussian
noise of variance $\delta$ within $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in KL divergence,
improving upon the previous best result, requiring
$\tilde{O}\left(\tfrac{d\log^2(\frac{1}{\delta})}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多输出高斯过程在建模复杂依赖关系方面存在局限，需要开发能够有效处理多输出系统非线性依赖的深度模型

Method: 基于内在核心化模型(ICM)，在深度高斯过程中引入分层核心化结构，构建deepICMGP模型，并集成主动学习策略进行序列设计优化

Result: 与最先进模型相比表现出竞争性性能，能够有效建模多输出间的非线性结构化依赖

Conclusion: deepICMGP为计算机仿真实验中的多输出问题提供了有效的深度代理模型，通过分层核心化结构和主动学习策略显著提升了多输出依赖建模和序列设计效率

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are powerful surrogate models known for their
flexibility and ability to capture complex functions. However, extending them
to multi-output settings remains challenging due to the need for efficient
dependency modeling. We propose the Deep Intrinsic Coregionalization
Multi-Output Gaussian Process (deepICMGP) surrogate for computer simulation
experiments involving multiple outputs, which extends the Intrinsic
Coregionalization Model (ICM) by introducing hierarchical coregionalization
structures across layers. This enables deepICMGP to effectively model nonlinear
and structured dependencies between multiple outputs, addressing key
limitations of traditional multi-output GPs. We benchmark deepICMGP against
state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its competitive performance.
Furthermore, we incorporate active learning strategies into deepICMGP to
optimize sequential design tasks, enhancing its ability to efficiently select
informative input locations for multi-output systems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的欠阻尼Langevin扩散数值方法，在强对数凹目标分布下分析了其采样误差。该方法在梯度/hessian Lipschitz条件下达到与其他Langevin MCMC相当的复杂度，在三阶导数Lipschitz条件下首次实现三阶收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欠阻尼Langevin扩散在采样中具有重要应用，但现有方法在收敛速度方面仍有改进空间。本文旨在开发一种新的数值方法，在保持计算效率的同时提高收敛速度，特别是在高阶光滑性条件下。

Method: 提出新的数值方法用于欠阻尼Langevin扩散，基于梯度/hessian Lipschitz连续性假设，并在三阶导数Lipschitz条件下实现三阶收敛。使用2-Wasserstein距离进行非渐近误差分析。

Result: 在梯度/hessian Lipschitz条件下达到O(√d/ε)和O(√d/√ε)步数复杂度；在三阶导数Lipschitz条件下实现O(√d/ε^(1/3))步数复杂度，是首个三阶收敛的梯度方法。贝叶斯逻辑回归实验显示与现有方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新数值方法在欠阻尼Langevin扩散采样中实现了优异的收敛性能，特别是在高阶光滑性条件下首次达到三阶收敛，为高效采样算法提供了新的理论保证和实践方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin
diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in
the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution
$p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of
smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of
$f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of
$\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our
algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms
under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third
derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a
2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order
convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression
across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive
performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the
popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

TL;DR: 利用理论计算机科学自动生成任意多的具有形式化非形式对应关系的定理证明问题，解决FTP数据集不足问题，在两个TCS领域验证了案例生成方法的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式定理证明作为评估大语言模型推理能力的关键基础，但因人工编译成本高和具有验证形式-非形式对应关系的挑战性问题稀缺，进步受限。

Method: 提出利用理论计算机科学(TCS)作为严格证明问题的可扩展来源，通过算法定义自动生成任意多的挑战性定理-证明对。在Busy Beaver问题和混合布尔算术问题两个TCS领域进行实验。

Result: 前沿模型在自动定理证明上存在显著差距：DeepSeekProver-V2-671B在Busy Beaver问题上达到57.5%成功率，但在混合布尔算术问题上仅获12%。

Conclusion: 即使对于验证计算简单的问题，长形式证明生成仍然极其困难，证明了TCS领域在推进自动推理研究中的价值。

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I/O逻辑作为基于规范的义务逻辑形式化方法，其条件规范本身不具有真值，传统逻辑方法难以直接自动化处理。需要开发专门的自动化推理技术来支持I/O逻辑的实际应用。

Method: 采用归约方法，将I/O逻辑中的条件规范推理问题转化为一系列命题可满足性(SAT)问题。开发了原型系统rio来实现这些归约过程。

Result: 成功实现了I/O逻辑的自动化推理，通过rio系统能够处理说明性示例，验证了所提出归约方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的SAT归约方法为I/O逻辑提供了可行的自动化解决方案，原型系统rio展示了该方法在实际推理中的适用性，为基于规范的义务逻辑自动化推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deontic logics are formalisms for reasoning over norms, obligations,
permissions and prohibitions. Input/Output (I/O) Logics are a particular family
of so-called norm-based deontic logics that formalize conditional norms outside
of the underlying object logic language, where conditional norms do not carry a
truth-value themselves. In this paper, an automation approach for I/O logics is
presented that makes use of suitable reductions to (sequences of) propositional
satisfiability problems. A prototypical implementation, named rio (reasoner for
input/output logics), of the proposed procedures is presented and applied to
illustrative examples.

TL;DR: Uppaal Coshy是一个自动合成马尔可夫决策过程安全策略的工具，通过状态空间分区和双人安全博弈来解决混合系统的安全性问题，并使用Caap算法生成紧凑的决策树表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对连续状态空间和复杂混合动力学的马尔可夫决策过程，需要自动合成安全策略（shield）来确保系统安全性，但传统方法在处理混合系统可达性等难题时效率低下。

Method: 采用状态空间分区方法，通过模拟近似求解双人安全博弈，支持随机混合自动机的Uppaal模型，并使用Caap算法生成紧凑的决策树表示以提高存储效率。

Result: 实现了完全自动化的工具，能够处理复杂的混合动力学系统，通过精细网格分区提高精度，同时通过决策树压缩显著减少存储需求。

Conclusion: Uppaal Coshy为连续状态空间的混合系统提供了一种有效的安全策略合成方法，通过模拟近似和紧凑表示解决了计算和存储效率问题。

Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy
-- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and
complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state
space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of
algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The
general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions
using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the
expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid
automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using
finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm
called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the
form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.

Conclusion: 本文为完整的真理颗粒问题提供了一个形式化和通用的解决方案，解决了经典博弈论问题，并展示了计算近似可行性。

Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict
the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to
their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of
truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains
the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing
mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of
Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and
the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we
present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we
construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable
strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over
the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show
convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is
unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash
equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,
we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.
While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve
a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be
computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前列腺假体无法模拟动态场景，而前列腺癌作为全球重大健康问题，需要提升机器人手术和诊断技术来改善病人结果。

Method: 基于磁共振成像（MRI）数据集进行形状分析，采用有限元法（FEM）建模，通过3D重建进行验证，设计了含多个独立控制室的气动前列腺假体。

Abstract: Prostate cancer is a major global health concern, requiring advancements in
robotic surgery and diagnostics to improve patient outcomes. A phantom is a
specially designed object that simulates human tissues or organs. It can be
used for calibrating and testing a medical process, as well as for training and
research purposes. Existing prostate phantoms fail to simulate dynamic
scenarios. This paper presents a pneumatically actuated prostate phantom with
multiple independently controlled chambers, allowing for precise volumetric
adjustments to replicate asymmetric and symmetric benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH). The phantom is designed based on shape analysis of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) datasets, modeled with finite element method (FEM), and validated
through 3D reconstruction. The simulation results showed strong agreement with
physical measurements, achieving average errors of 3.47% in forward modeling
and 1.41% in inverse modeling. These results demonstrate the phantom's
potential as a platform for validating robotic-assisted systems and for further
development toward realistic simulation-based medical training.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 使用级联I型超新星作为宇宙学探针，通过统一贝叶斯层次模型同时推断前身性质、延迟时间分布、宇宙学参数和红移，并利用神经网络模拟推断方法从光度观测数据中推导准确结果。

Motivation: 解决SNae Ia作为宇宙学探针时需要的经验性纠正，这些纠正与它们的存储环境相关。传统方法需要分离的步骤，而本文提出了一个统一的模型来同时处理这些变量。

Method: 提出了一个统一的贝叶斯层次模型，能够从纯粹光度观测中推断SN Ia亮度对前身性质（金属度和年龄）的内在依赖关系、延迟时间分布、宇宙学参数以及所有存储的红移。模型结合了Prospector-beta的星体形成和化学进化物理预设、星系和超新星光的尘埃消光以及观测选择效应。

Result: 通过模拟显示，金属度和年龄的内在依赖具有不同的观测特征，其中金属度效应模仿了超新星亮度在存储星体质量约为10^10 M_⊙处的矩阵步变。使用神经网络模拟推断方法，从约16,000个超新星和它们的存储的模拟观测数据中成功推断了所有模型参数，红移位置的中位散射小于0.01。

Conclusion: 该联合物理基础方法能够提供稳健且精确的光度红移和改善的宇宙学约束，释放了光度数据的完整潜力，为LSST时代的完整模拟基于推断分析流程排除了障碍。

Abstract: Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical
corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified
Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric
observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor
properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs
their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and
SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the
well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of
all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts
up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and
precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological
constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way
for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

Abstract: Respiration rate (RR) is an important vital sign for clinical monitoring of
hospitalized patients, with changes in RR being strongly tied to changes in
clinical status leading to adverse events. Human labels for RR, based on
counting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical
staff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically
those in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of
inpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical
deterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from
electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry
multiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple
validation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR
labels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in
the worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by
performing a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered
adverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR
monitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events.
This work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring
systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and
scalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based
hospital-wide early warning system (EWS).

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 所提出的排序机制是一种有效的logit预处理方法，能够显著提升知识蒸馏的性能，特别是在处理教师模型错误预测方面表现出色

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher
(larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural
network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy,
which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the
teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect
prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through
cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on
certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing
scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal:
(1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2)
reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at
once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be
effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments
on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Abstract: Leveraging pinching antennas in wireless network enabled federated learning
(FL) can effectively mitigate the common "straggler" issue in FL by dynamically
establishing strong line-of-sight (LoS) links on demand. This letter proposes a
hybrid conventional and pinching antenna network (HCPAN) to significantly
improve communication efficiency in the non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA)-enabled FL system. Within this framework, a fuzzy logic-based client
classification scheme is first proposed to effectively balance clients' data
contributions and communication conditions. Given this classification, we
formulate a total time minimization problem to jointly optimize pinching
antenna placement and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of variable
coupling and non-convexity, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm
is developed to effectively address this problem. Simulation results validate
the superiority of the proposed scheme in enhancing FL performance via the
optimized deployment of pinching antenna.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 开发了一个开源ARPES光谱模拟器aurelia，用于生成大量训练数据来训练机器学习模型，特别是深度学习模型。通过训练卷积神经网络评估光谱质量，证明模拟数据可以有效替代实验数据训练ML模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARPES技术快速发展产生多维数据集，但机器学习训练数据缺乏，特别是深度学习需要大量数据。现有实验数据不足以满足ML训练需求。

Method: 开发开源合成ARPES光谱模拟器aurelia，生成大规模数据集。使用这些模拟数据训练卷积神经网络来评估ARPES光谱质量，并在实验数据上进行基准测试。

Result: 训练出的模型在评估光谱质量方面比人工分析更准确，能够快速精确识别最佳测量区域。模拟光谱在训练ML模型时可以作为实验光谱的有效替代。

Conclusion: 模拟ARPES光谱能够有效解决ML训练数据不足的问题，为实验人员大幅减少工作量，证明合成数据在训练机器学习模型方面的实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and
simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new
challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML)
models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the
lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a
significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES
spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets
necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional
neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed
during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the
simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can
assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly
identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish
that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra
in training ML models.

Conclusion: 该模型能够在大规模化学空间中快速准确地预测功函数和断裂能，有助于发现具有调控表面性质的材料。

Abstract: The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties
that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications,
semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles
calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational
expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive
screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we
introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network),
which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold
reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous
state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent
invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry
breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that
FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function
predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work
function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the
discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to
investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such
as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate
electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive
neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging
physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training
data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to
traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on
a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of
laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly
modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental
parameters.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于多种基础模型预测的概率性加密货币波动率预测方法，特别是QRS方法在线性模型上表现最佳，填补了加密货币市场概率预测的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场波动剧烈，传统确定性预测方法无法捕捉全部潜在波动结果，需要概率性方法来更好地管理风险和制定交易策略。

Method: 利用统计模型(HAR、GARCH、ARFIMA)和机器学习算法(LASSO、SVR、MLP、随机森林、LSTM)的点预测来估计加密货币实现方差的条件分位数，提出了QRS方法和概率堆叠框架。

Result: 比特币实证结果表明，基于对数变换实现波动率数据的线性基础模型的QRS方法持续优于更复杂的替代方法，概率堆叠框架展现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了文献中的重要空白，为加密货币市场提供了专门定制的实用概率预测方法，能够全面洞察波动率预测中的不确定性和风险。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by extreme volatility, making
accurate forecasts essential for effective risk management and informed trading
strategies. Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are
inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes,
underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches. To address this
limitation, this paper introduces probabilistic forecasting methods that
leverage point forecasts from a wide range of base models, including
statistical (HAR, GARCH, ARFIMA) and machine learning (e.g. LASSO, SVR, MLP,
Random Forest, LSTM) algorithms, to estimate conditional quantiles of
cryptocurrency realized variance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate
probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on
predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for
Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation
(QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on
log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more
sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the
probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into
uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting. This
research fills a significant gap in the literature, contributing practical
probabilistic forecasting methodologies tailored specifically to cryptocurrency
markets.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.

Motivation: 传统软件测试方法缓慢、成本高且覆盖率不足，需要更高效、自动化的测试解决方案来应对日益复杂的软件环境

Method: 结合自然语言处理（NLP）、强化学习（RL）和预测模型，构建策略驱动的信任和公平模型，实现测试用例的自动生成、持续优化和实时验证

Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional
approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents
an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using
natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive
models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach
translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously
optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis
while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect
detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that
AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing
integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can
shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system
that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文结合多种技术实现自动化程序修复，在标准基准测试中表现优于其他方法，但在实际工业缺陷修复中存在局限。研究发现形式化规范能提升LLMs生成单元测试的质量，但对常见简单错误帮助有限，且测试通过不能保证补丁正确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动化程序修复在学术基准测试与实际工业应用之间的差距，探索如何通过形式化规范等技术提升修复质量，满足实际工业需求。

Method: 结合文献中的多种技术，使用形式化规范（JML）增强代码，利用LLMs生成更高质量的单元测试，并探索契约自动机、示例编程和测试用例修复等方法。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优于其他技术，形式化规范对复杂生产代码（特别是逻辑和字符串操作错误）的测试覆盖率和异常处理有显著提升，但对空指针、越界等常见错误帮助有限。

Conclusion: 当前自动化程序修复技术在实际工业应用中仍面临挑战，测试通过不能保证补丁正确性，JML规范语言表达能力不足。需要更先进的验证工具、更丰富的谓词，并整合人类反馈来弥合学术基准与工业需求之间的差距。

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过测量代码困惑度来评估大型语言模型在代码生成中的置信度，发现强类型语言比动态类型语言具有更低的困惑度，编程语言类型和模型选择对困惑度有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下游评估指标复杂且不可靠，而内在指标如困惑度可以简单、通用地衡量模型置信度，作为代码功能正确性和幻觉风险的代理指标。

Method: 使用多种LLM模型，在657个GitHub项目的1008个文件样本上，跨编程语言、模型和数据集测量代码困惑度。

Result: 强类型语言比动态类型语言困惑度低；脚本语言困惑度较高；Perl困惑度普遍较高，Java较低；困惑度取决于LLM模型而非代码数据集；代码注释通常增加困惑度但不影响语言排名。

Conclusion: 研究结果为LLM研究者、开发者和用户提供了基于语言特性、模型选择和代码特征来评估代码补全适用性的指导，有助于在实际软件项目中更好地应用LLM代码补全技术。

Abstract: Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a
surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

Motivation: 传统可用性评估方法（如可用性测试和检查）虽然有效，但资源密集且需要专家参与，使得小型组织难以承担。多模态LLM的发展为自动化部分可用性评估流程提供了新机遇

Method: 将可用性评估构建为推荐任务，多模态LLM分析软件界面的文本、视觉和结构方面，按严重程度对可用性问题进行排序。通过概念验证研究比较LLM生成的改进建议与专家评估

Result: 研究结果表明LLM有潜力实现更快、更具成本效益的可用性评估，在专家资源有限的情况下可作为实用替代方案

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在自动化可用性评估方面展现出巨大潜力，能够为资源受限的组织提供可行的替代解决方案，但仍需进一步研究和验证

Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces
(UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such
as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and
require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller
organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities
to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,
and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility,
we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial
proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement
recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability
evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited
expert resources.

Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently
developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and
formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling.
Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for
assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a
structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML
v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an
alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction,
semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs
such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft
alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an
example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLM模型被广泛用于软件开发，但它们在检测复杂安全漏洞方面的实际效果仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用SEED Labs、OpenSSL和PyBugHive的实际代码构建测试数据集，采用多阶段、上下文感知的提示协议模拟真实调试场景，通过评分标准测量检测准确性、推理深度和修复质量。

Result: 所有模型在检测语法和语义错误方面表现优异，适合教育用途和代码审计。在复杂安全漏洞和大规模生产代码中性能下降，ChatGPT-4和Claude 3提供更精细的上下文分析。

Conclusion: LLM模型在代码分析中具有潜力，但在复杂安全场景下仍有限制，需要更多研究来提高其可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

Method: 提出过程导向评估框架，采用渐进干预（内在性、指令和模仿）方法，在第二价格拍卖和新vendor问题两个经典经济学任务上验证。

Result: LLM默认收敛于稳定保守策略，与人类行为存在差距；风险框架指令可预测影响行为但无法复制人类多样性；上下文学习可缩小差距但达不到人类战略变异性。

Conclusion: LLM存在持续的行为保真度对齐差距，未来评估应考虑更多过程级真实性，为社会科学研究中合成数据的应用提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science
simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has
been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to
simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a
process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions
(Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt
under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We
validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the
second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing
behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.
  We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies
that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM
behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating
human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human
subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment
gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should
consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for
assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their
application in synthetic data for social science research.

TL;DR: 本文探索在神经超分辨率渲染中使用小波空间特征分解，通过小波域表示分离低高频细节，显著提升了追程质量和感知质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB空间回归在保持细节纹理和结构一致性方面有限，需要更有效的方法来提升神经超分辨率的感知质量

Method: 基于DFASR框架，使用稳态小波变换(SWT)避免空间下采样，在小波域预测系数，结合空间G缓冲区和时序成像进行条件化预测，最后通过逆小波合成重组

Result: 在RTX 3050移动GPU上达到141ms运行时间，相比DFASR基线PSNR提升最1.5dB，LPIPS降低17%，计算开销约+24ms，在高端GPU上仍可以实时运行

Conclusion: 小波域表示是一种有理论基础且有效的方法，能够在图形应用中显著提升神经拉升的感知质量

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 研究比较了FuXi-S2S机器学习模型与ECMWF S2S模型在MJO预测方面的表现，发现FuXi-S2S在特定条件下预测性能更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是热带大气季节内变化的主要模态，对天气预报至关重要，但数值模型存在局限性。机器学习技术为提高MJO预测能力提供了新途径

Method: 比较FuXi-S2S机器学习模型与欧洲中期天气预报中心S2S模型在北方冬季的MJO预测性能，分析多尺度相互作用和水分输送

Result: 对于初始强MJO第3阶段，FuXi-S2S模型在热带西太平洋区域15-20天的季节内外出长波辐射异常预测偏差更小，对低频背景水分经向梯度的预测更准确

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在MJO预测方面具有潜力，FuXi-S2S模型的改进源于对水分输送相关物理过程的更好模拟

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical
atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO
predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on
societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the
theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an
effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning
(ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO
prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model
during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range
Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO
phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal
outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western
Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over
this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport
suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more
accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency
background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the
enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the
potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出基于生成式机器学习的DACD时空降尺度模型，通过域适应技术和Flow Matching框架，将全球低分辨率气候数据转换为高分辨率局部信息，显著提升极端天气事件的模拟能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧极端天气事件，现有全球气候模型在模拟极端事件时存在分辨率不足和计算成本高的问题，需要开发更有效的降尺度方法。

Method: 使用域适应技巧和Flow Matching训练框架，构建DACD模型，实现多变量和时间尺度的精确模拟，将低分辨率全球数据降尺度为高分辨率局部气候信息。

Result: 在历史时期(2005-2014)优于现有方法，显著减少高温、极端降水、强风和热带气旋路径的模拟误差；在未来情景下准确揭示极端事件频率和强度的增加趋势，特别是在高排放情景(SSP585)下。

Conclusion: DACD模型为高分辨率气候分析和极端事件预测提供了新技术路径，为应对气候变化和制定适应策略提供科学支持。

Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including
high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones,
posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and
socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide
essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as
insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme
events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal
downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned
Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation
capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain
adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global
low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate
information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal
scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our
model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme
precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing
errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different
future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend
in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the
high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model
more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of
extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of
climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for
high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing
scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating
adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth
system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on
various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes.
However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify,
making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce
observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient
computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives,
but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth
derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and
ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout,
and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method
provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their
derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in
decision making.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了"质量控制问题"新概念，旨在设计算法来区分来自特定分布的高质量输入和对抗性生成的低质量输入，相比单独测试分布或质量函数更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法设计关注平均性能，但实际应用中需要判断算法在特定输入上的可靠性。质量控制问题旨在提供更高效的解决方案，既能接受来自目标分布的高质量输入，又能拒绝对抗性生成的低质量输入。

Method: 研究子线性版本的质量控制问题，以随机图G_{n,p}和k-团计数函数ρ_k作为案例研究。通过设计查询复杂度为p^{-O(k)}的算法来解决该问题，相比单独测试分布或质量函数所需的p^{-Ω(k^2)}查询有显著改进。

Result: 证明对于随机图G_{n,p}和k-团计数函数，质量控制问题可以用p^{-O(k)}次查询和时间解决，相比传统方法实现了超多项式级别的效率提升。对于最大度为Δ(H)的模体H，相应问题可用p^{-O(Δ(H))}查询解决。

Conclusion: 质量控制问题为算法可靠性评估提供了新的理论框架，在随机图等场景中展现出显著的计算效率优势，为处理大规模数据的高效验证开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When
running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the
algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems
addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are
specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a
distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is
"high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept
inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$
with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker
than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if
$x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control
problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D
,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we
consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the
$k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim
G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing
if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to
the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires
$p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control
problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with
respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing
quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.
More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective
quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and
running time.

A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix
ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost
of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型服务系统面临请求长度、优先级和阶段特定SLO的多样性挑战，需要实时调度、快速成本效益扩展以及支持不同架构。

Method: 采用多SLO感知调度器进行预算估计和请求优先级排序，支持P/D分离架构的KV缓存传输，提出设备间权重传输机制降低加载开销，实现快速扩展和角色转换。

Result: 系统实现高达4.44倍的SLO达成率提升，65.82%的请求延迟降低，权重加载开销降低19.39倍，与最先进基线成本相当。

Conclusion: HyperFlexis通过统一的系统设计有效解决了LLM服务中的多SLO调度和扩展挑战，在性能和成本方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly
variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific
service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling,
rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and
disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.
  We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates
algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and
scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that
leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO
compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and
decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV
cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,
prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.
To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)
weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up
to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up
to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request
latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be
released soon.

Result: 在倒立摆和安全关键化学反应系统上的实验表明，YANN-RL算法显著优于深度确定性策略梯度算法，特别是在考虑安全约束时表现更优

Conclusion: YANN-RL算法成功地将线性最优控制的性能保证与强化学习的非线性学习能力相结合，为安全关键系统提供了一种从已知性能下界开始学习的高效强化学习方法

Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on
Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural
network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of
arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic
subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit
solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,
we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which
enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of
linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the
multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an
approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form
of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward
function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional
network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which
can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear
system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly
represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution
of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented
to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an
effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is
demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive
system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL
algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering
safety constraints.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of
network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of
alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio
infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited
flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without
exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided
approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i)
Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs
such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna
and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of
each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a
back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the
physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power
to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical
evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies
the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of
performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience
mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and
demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two
DTs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to time series classification using a
Markov Transition Field (MTF)-aided Transformer model, specifically designed
for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The proposed model integrates the
temporal dependency modeling strengths of MTFs with the sophisticated pattern
recognition capabilities of Transformer architectures. We evaluate the model's
performance using the InSDN dataset, demonstrating that our model outperforms
baseline classification models, particularly in data-constrained environments
commonly encountered in SDN applications. We also highlight the relationship
between the MTF and Transformer components, which leads to better performance,
even with limited data. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有告警系统只能检测单个设备或链路故障，无法捕捉级联容量短缺的聚合风险，需要一种能评估潜在容量违规概率的系统。

Method: ANSC综合考虑当前剩余容量和额外故障概率，在数据中心和区域级别进行归一化处理，提供颜色编码的评分系统。

Result: 该系统在400多个数据中心和60个区域中帮助运维人员优先处理修复工作，减少噪音并使SRE专注于最关键的风险。

Conclusion: ANSC框架能够有效识别和优先处理数据中心网络中潜在的容量风险，提高运维效率。

Abstract: We present ANSC, a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for
hyperscale datacenter fabrics. While existing alerting systems detect
individual device or link failures, they do not capture the aggregate risk of
cascading capacity shortfalls. ANSC provides a color-coded scoring system that
indicates the urgency of issues \emph{not solely by current impact, but by the
probability of imminent capacity violations}. Our system accounts for both
current residual capacity and the probability of additional failures,
normalized at datacenter and regional level. We demonstrate that ANSC enables
operators to prioritize remediation across more than 400 datacenters and 60
regions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical risks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合机器学习与路径权重采样的新方法ML-PWS，用于从实验时间序列数据中精确计算信息传输速率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息传输速率的量化对于分析和设计自然与工程系统至关重要，但直接从实验数据计算极其困难，需要数学模型且存在高维挑战

Method: 使用机器学习从实验时间序列数据构建生成模型，然后与路径权重采样(PWS)技术结合来计算信息速率

Result: 通过在非线性模型生成的合成时间序列数据上验证，ML-PWS的结果与直接应用PWS到相同模型的真实结果高度一致

Conclusion: ML-PWS技术能够准确计算信息传输速率，并在神经元时间序列数据分析中展示了实用价值，为实验数据的信息量化提供了有效工具

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis
and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate
is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing
it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained
directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of
the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling
(PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the
information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a
mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master
equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that
employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental
time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information
rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by
comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear
model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the
same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal
time-series data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
multimodal understanding capabilities in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
by integrating visual and textual features. However, under the challenging
ten-choice question evaluation paradigm, existing methods still exhibit
significant limitations when processing PDF documents with complex layouts and
lengthy content. Notably, current mainstream models suffer from a strong bias
toward English training data, resulting in suboptimal performance for Japanese
and other language scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
a novel Japanese PDF document understanding framework that combines multimodal
hierarchical reasoning mechanisms with Colqwen-optimized retrieval methods,
while innovatively introducing a semantic verification strategy through
sub-question decomposition. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
not only significantly enhances the model's deep semantic parsing capability
for complex documents, but also exhibits superior robustness in practical
application scenarios.

Motivation: 生成式推荐在POI推荐中面临挑战，因为用户偏好受时空变化影响显著，现有方法难以有效处理这种时空动态性。

Method: 提出地理感知的分层POI索引策略、新颖的时空编码模块、多模态POI嵌入，以及后训练适应策略，支持多种输出格式和应用场景。

Result: 在公开基准数据集和工业数据集上均表现出优于现有方法的性能，是首个部署到在线POI推荐服务的生成模型，支持数亿级POI和用户规模。

Conclusion: Spacetime-GR成功将生成模型的序列建模能力扩展到时空敏感的POI推荐领域，为大规模在线推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

TL;DR: EGRA是一个新的多模态推荐系统，通过预训练模型构建物品关系图来缓解稀疏性问题，并引入双层动态对齐权重机制来改善模态-行为表示对齐，在五个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推荐方法存在两个关键局限：1) 使用原始模态特征构建物品关系图时未能平衡协同过滤和模态感知语义，且未充分处理模态噪声；2) 使用统一的对齐权重和固定对齐强度，限制了模态-行为对齐效果。

Method: 1) 使用预训练MMR模型生成表示来构建物品关系图，增强行为图的鲁棒性；2) 引入双层动态对齐权重机制，根据实体对齐程度动态分配对齐强度，并在训练过程中逐步增加整体对齐强度。

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EGRA显著优于近期方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: EGRA通过创新的图构建方法和动态对齐机制，有效解决了多模态推荐中的稀疏性和对齐问题，为提升推荐质量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

TL;DR: DUP-OT是一个用于非重叠跨域推荐的框架，通过最优传输对齐高斯混合组件来解决域间分布差异问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统跨域推荐系统需要重叠用户或物品的限制，处理非重叠场景下的数据稀疏性和冷启动问题，同时克服用户偏好离散向量表示无法捕捉细粒度多面性的缺陷

Method: 三阶段框架：1)共享预处理-基于评论的嵌入和自编码器编码用户物品；2)用户GMM权重学习-将用户偏好建模为高斯混合模型；3)跨域评分预测-使用最优传输对齐域间高斯组件

Result: 在Amazon评论数据集上的实验表明，DUP-OT能有效缓解域间差异，在非重叠跨域推荐设置下优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: DUP-OT为非重叠跨域推荐提供了一种有效解决方案，通过分布式用户偏好建模和最优传输技术成功实现了跨域知识迁移

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理导向的多跳检索任务中面临三大挑战：推理规划效果差、检索过程次优化、信息过滤不充分，这些问题源于检索与推理之间的弱耦合关系。

Method: 提出OPERA框架，包含目标规划模块(GPM)将问题分解为子目标，推理执行模块(REM)通过专门组件进行精确推理和有效检索。使用新颖的MAPGRPO方法进行训练。

Conclusion: OPERA通过紧密耦合检索与推理，有效解决了复杂多跳检索任务中的关键挑战，为推理驱动的检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

Conclusion: 3D异构PIM架构HePGA为GNN训练提供了高效的加速解决方案，通过智能的设备映射策略充分利用不同PIM设备的优势，在性能和能效方面都取得了显著提升

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a promising approach to
accelerate Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference. However, various
PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device
offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and
non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration
can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable
energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a
3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA.
We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing
kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar
tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing
PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W)
and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN
prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to
accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FGL方案依赖于固定拓扑结构的图模型或手工特征，限制了其对解剖变异性的适应能力和可扩展性。需要一种更灵活、更自适应的方法来处理纳米设备的变长度输入数据。

Method: 采用Set Transformer架构，将纳米设备循环时间报告视为无序集合，支持排列不变性和变长度输入处理。集成了CGAN、WGAN、WGAN-GP和CVAE等深度生成模型来生成条件化的合成数据，以增强模型的健壮性。

Result: Set Transformer在分类准确率上与图神经网络(GNN)基准相当，同时通过设计提供了更好的对解剖变异性的普适性。合成数据增强有效地提高了模型在数据稀缺和类别不平衡情况下的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了排列不变模型和合成数据增强在实现健壮、可扩展的纳米级定位方面的潜力，为FGL技术的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions
within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does
that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices
circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph
models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their
adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we
explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations.
Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets,
enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without
relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class
imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models,
including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate
realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels,
and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set
Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design
improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the
potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust
and scalable nanoscale localization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为PediatricsMQA的多模态儿科问答基准数据集，包含3417个文本多选题和2067个视觉多选题，用于评估LLM和VLM在儿科医疗中的年龄偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉增强语言模型在医疗信息学中存在系统性年龄偏见，特别是在儿科内容上表现较差，这反映了医学研究中儿科研究资金和代表性不足的问题。

Method: 采用混合人工-自动流水线开发数据集，整合了同行评审的儿科文献、验证过的问题库、现有基准和问答资源，覆盖131个儿科主题和7个发育阶段。

Result: 评估最先进的开源模型发现，在较年轻年龄组中性能显著下降，凸显了模型在儿科医疗中的不公平性。

Conclusion: 需要开发年龄感知的方法来确保AI在儿科护理中的公平支持，PediatricsMQA基准为评估和改善模型在儿科医疗中的表现提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

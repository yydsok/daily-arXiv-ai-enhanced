However,\nexisting Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted\ninteraction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and\nconstraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas\nconstruction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of\nsemi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement\nLearning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By\nformulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost\njointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified\nprobabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives\npursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and\nnovel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we\npropose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy\nthat collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise\nrewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven\nframework for autonomous Mas graph construction.

Current memory systems\noften grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal\nawareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw\ninteraction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory\nframework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph\n(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles\n(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and\nsituational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs\nare interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving\nknowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive\nrefinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of\ninsight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived\nfrom identified clusters of related IPs.

To address this, we\npresent three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data\ngeneration framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously\ntest the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.\nSecond, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800\ntasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and\nhuman-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent\narchitectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing\naverage success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the\ntool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools\nnearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between\ncurrent agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world\nSOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the\nneed for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before\ndeployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at\nhttp://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/.

Paper submitted for review. Code\n  available at https://github.com/fr-meyer/MD-ViSCo", "summary": "Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target\nvital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are\ndesigned exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires\ndistinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing\npipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical\nsettings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional\nVital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any\ntarget waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or\narterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single\nmodel. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin\nTransformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture\ndistinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct\nmulti-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our\nframework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average\nacross all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and\nimproving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the\ngenerated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical\nInstrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British\nHypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By\neliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe\nthat this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital\nsign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "MD-ViSCo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u6ce2\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6e90-\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d45\u5c421D U-Net\u4e0eSwin Transformer\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528AdaIN\u6355\u6349\u6ce2\u5f62\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MAE\u964d\u4f4e8.8%\uff0cPC\u63d0\u9ad84.9%\uff0cABP\u6ce2\u5f62\u6ee1\u8db3AAMI\u548cBHS\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "MD-ViSCo\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u5f00\u53d1\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art semantic\nsegmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,\nwell-annotated remote sensing datasets.

Many infrastructure networks\nhave graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or\nconnectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground\ntruth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a\nsemantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,\nDEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module\nprocesses satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on\nthe entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show\nthat IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and\ntraining with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.\nIGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and\nmapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery.

Traditional citation frameworks -- grounded in credibility,\nretrievability, and authorship -- struggle to accommodate the dynamic and\nephemeral nature of AI outputs. In this paper, we examine how undergraduate\nstudents in a UX design course approached AI usage and citation when given the\nfreedom to integrate generative tools into their design process. Through\nqualitative analysis of 35 team projects and reflections from 175 students, we\nidentify varied citation practices ranging from formal attribution to indirect\nor absent acknowledgment. These inconsistencies reveal gaps in existing\nframeworks and raise questions about authorship, assessment, and pedagogical\ntransparency. We argue for rethinking AI citation as a reflective and\npedagogical practice; one that supports metacognitive engagement by prompting\nstudents to critically evaluate how and why they used AI throughout the design\nprocess.

Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality\nimbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual\ninputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes\nhallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs\ndo not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model\n(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on\noffline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to\ndynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified\nrewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM\nalignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,\nModality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality\nimbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset\nby generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due\nto limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of\ninput images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended\ntasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed\nto train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging\nvision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6MBPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "MBPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5c01\u95ed\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7ebf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GRPO\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMBPO\u80fd\u63d0\u5347LMM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "MBPO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Complex networks have emerged as powerful structures\nfor the quantitative analysis of Western classical music, revealing significant\nfeatures of its harmonic and structural organization.

In\nrecent years, the limitations of traditional graph representations have been\nquestioned and challenged in the context of interactions that could be\nhigher-dimensional. Effective musical analysis requires models that capture\nhigher-order interactions and a framework that simultaneously captures\ntransitions between them. Subsequently, in this paper, we present a topological\nframework for analyzing J. S.

While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has\nbeen widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To\nthis end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of\nmodel activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths\nin their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength\ncausally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector.\nSpecifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely\nbased on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs\nestimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs\nencode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector\nembedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude\nmodulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced\nreasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to\nincreased reasoning token number and even improved performance.

However, due to the tilt of the\nsupporting leg, the error of the contact model are amplified, making robot\nstate estimation more challenging. Therefore, this paper focuses on the noise\nanalysis and state estimation for robot walking with the ESVC foot. First,\nthrough physical robot experiments, we investigate the effect of the ESVC foot\non robot measurement noise and process noise. and a noise-time regression model\nusing sliding window strategy is developed. Then, a hierarchical adaptive state\nestimator for biped robots with the ESVC foot is proposed. The state estimator\nconsists of two stages: pre-estimation and post-estimation. In the\npre-estimation stage, a data fusion-based estimation is employed to process the\nsensory data.

Instead of relying on expert labor in analyzing specific linguistic\nfeatures, these new methods enable the exploration of linguistic variation\nthrough embeddings derived directly from speech, opening new avenues for\nlarge-scale, data-driven analyses.\n  This study employs embeddings from the fine-tuned XLS-R self-supervised\nlanguage identification model voxlingua107-xls-r-300m-wav2vec, to analyze\nrelationships between 106 world languages based on speech recordings. Using\nlinear discriminant analysis (LDA), language embeddings are clustered and\ncompared with genealogical, lexical, and geographical distances.

Although frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nModel-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) offer foundational tools, they often\nlack integration when used together. This paper addresses that gap by aligning\nthe widely recognized V-model development paradigm with the MeROS metamodel\nSysML-based modeling language tailored for ROS-based systems.\n  We propose a domain-specific methodology that bridges ROS-centric modelling\nwith systems engineering practices. Our approach formalises the structure,\nbehaviour, and validation processes of robotic systems using MeROS, while\nextending it with a generalized, adaptable V-model compatible with both ROS and\nROS 2.

ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and\nstandardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and\nequitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and\nlanguage disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR\nsystems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in\nexisting standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them\nimpacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance\nfor aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text\nstandardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR\nperformance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be\nconsistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech\ncommunities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second,\naudits often display high-level demographic findings without further\nconsidering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic\nsubgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the\ninput audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the\nWord Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising\nfrom generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a\nmore holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and\nexemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR\nperformance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group.

This\nprocedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a\ndomain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional\npredictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,\ntraditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model\nitself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings\nspecifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense\nlayer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into\nSFT as prediction layers may further improve performance.

Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the\neffectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,\nand 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on\nAutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show\nsubstantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,\nScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches\nthe same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success\nrate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it\nlifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative\nimprovement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoSDT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u6536\u96c6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86AutoSDT-5K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AutoSDT-Coder\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u8981AI\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAutoSDT-5K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "AutoSDT-5K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b5,404\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a93%\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\uff0c92.2%\u4ee3\u7801\u6b63\u786e\u3002AutoSDT-Coder\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoSDT\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, the deployment of such systems in\nconsumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination,\nbias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations\nfrom health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose\nResponsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and\ngoverning AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin\nprocesses multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe,\nrelevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the\nResponsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional\nLLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the\nsystem instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of\nhallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to\nstructure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses\nthat are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for\nwell-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a\nfeedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We\nevaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental\nsupport, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE\nachieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and\nBERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical\ncompliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation,\noutperforming baseline strategies.

Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and\nsemi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each\ncontrol, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to\ndevelop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to\nautomatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera\nattached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will\nautomatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to\nthe hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped,\njust naturally place the object close to the table and the system will\nautomatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb\nloss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce\nmental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation\nsystem to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand\ncontrol model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand\nactions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data\nfrom one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning\nalgorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and\nunseen objects with a variation of weights.

While\nrecent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,\nexisting methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and\nconflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain\ngeneralization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through\nsharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a\ngradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and\nadversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class\nimbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a\ncurvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes\nunderrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution\nalignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy\nregularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies\noptimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional\nalignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework.

To address this issue,\nexisting approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative\nmodeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques\noriginally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major\ndistinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent\nsamples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves\ngenerating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal\ncoherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,\nwe propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency\nconsistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the\naction model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting\nefficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency\nconsistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action\nfeatures across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting\nconvergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In\naddition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal\nvariations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53\ntasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing\none-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the\nvision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance\ndegradation on the 40 tasks of Libero.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft\nmodels for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility\nbeyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the\nattention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on\nlong-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher\naccuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in\nmemory usage, latency, and throughput.

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there\nhas been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing\nthe translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies\nhave explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into\ncollaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation\nquality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing\nmulti-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from\ncognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators\nemploy different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free\ntranslation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating\noutputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed\nmulti-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with\nCognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six\nfunctionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in\nhuman translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,\nevaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering.

To address this,\nwe propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model\nsampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising\nper-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency\ncontent of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early\nstage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly\nimproves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image\nfidelity and text alignment.

Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm\nin imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an\nobject as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved\nsensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of\nhidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using\nNLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or\nsurfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned\nfrom datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling\ntransient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a\nself-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient\ndatasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features\nfrom partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the\nunmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts\nfull measurements.

To\naddress this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal\ndecomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for\nretraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer\ndepends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as\nunified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract\nthe most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or\ndisrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes\nunnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of\nPCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads.

Instead of relying solely\non prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity\nmeme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual\ndescriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme\nclassification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual\ncontent and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general\nlarge language models (LLMs).

Existing off-dynamics offline RL\nmethods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the\ntarget domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by\nthe limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the\nlearned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.\nWe propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that\naddresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via\nlearned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target\ndomain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during\noffline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn\ndynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched\ndynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these\ndatasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy.

However, existing methods usually\nsuffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational\ncosts (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for\nlong videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that\nleverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\\alpha$,\nachieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To\nbalance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal\nmodeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary\ncomponents: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal\nmodeling within short frame segment ($\\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii)\nAttention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments\n($\\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token\nflows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame\ncontexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment\ninformation via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal\noverhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we\nintroduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches\narising from different diffusion sampling steps.

To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose\nHigh-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a\nmethod that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing\nhelpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human\npreferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by\ntraining a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a\ntwo-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the\nreward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost\nconstraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to\nverify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the\nactual cost constraint.

This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection\ntechnique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive\nexperiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over\nstate-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior\nmethods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5QUITE\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u89c4\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u867d\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u91cd\u5199\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002LLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FSM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u53cd\u9988\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u91cd\u5199\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "QUITE\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe35.8%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u751f\u621024.1%\u7684\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "QUITE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u5199\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3aSQL\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with\nexternal systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little\nsystematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel\nbenchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.\nAR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and\nguessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and\nmeasure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning\nchallenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary\nLLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently\nfail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks.

High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on\nArgoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up\nto +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP\n(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

We develop SAMSelect and show its use\nfor marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in\nSentinel-2 imagery.

Out of these\ndifficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains\na common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a\ncase-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect\nselects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification\naccuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model.

Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual\nbenefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising\nMarkov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,\nhowever, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,\nsurprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we\nexplain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes\nuse of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov\nprocesses: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed\nrate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in\nthe known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show\nthat we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any\ndiscrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete\ndiffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking\ndiffusion.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for\nquantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for\nprivate model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational\nlearning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate\nin multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;\nand (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially\ncoupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy\namplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework\nfor relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a\nrigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping\nscheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.\nWe also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of\ncoupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes.

Existing approaches struggle as they\nrely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions,\nand camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We\npropose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense\npoint tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By\nleveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion\ntrajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based\noptimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster\nassignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views\ndespite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory\nsignal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,\nimproving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By\ninitializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for\ntraining, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video\ndatasets and four evaluation benchmarks.

In\nthis work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear\nregression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional\nlinear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass\nSGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has\na power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior\nwith an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show\nthat multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,\nwhere $L \\lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations.

We close this gap with the Hierarchical\nLexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic\nproposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and\n(iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of\nHLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG,\nwhich performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for\nhigh-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse\ntopics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context\nfor exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity\nrequired to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing\non single-document queries or limited datasets.

AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\\%. Current\nclinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA\ndiameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet\nthese criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on\nthe maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the\ncomplex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized\nintervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve\nmonitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model\nto predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with\nlocal, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have\nparameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular\nsurface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using\na longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24\nAAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model\npredicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of\n1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a\npatient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).\nFinally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set\nconsisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital.

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a\npromising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS\nmethods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited\nlabeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.\nWe propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and\ndiverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can\neffectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for\nSSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and\nFusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge\nembedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.\nSpecifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and\nCLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student\nfeatures with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative\npower, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.\nExtensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS\nPotsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem.

Although a straight-line\nconnection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast,\nand easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns,\nwhich arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling\nspace. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow\nonly needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\\bm v$ between the two\ndistributions $\\bm\\pi_0$ and $\\bm\\pi_1$. In this work, we present\nDiscretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow\nmodels since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random\nvelocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path\ninto a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'')\nto expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution\n$p_\\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly\nsuperimposed on $\\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\\bm v$ of the\nsub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and\nmulti-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several\nrepresentative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by\nsampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse\nand efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.\nCode is available at https://github.com/liuruixun/momentum-fm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Discretized-RF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f4\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u6bb5\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u5ea6\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiscretized-RF\uff0c\u5c06\u8def\u5f84\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u91cf\u573a\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Discretized-RF\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art\nmathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing\naccess to high-performance AI research.\nhttps://github.com/shinandrew/YouronMath.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5355\u5f20\u666e\u901a\u6e38\u620fGPU\uff08RTX 3080 Ti\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdAI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5f2016GB\u663e\u5b58\u7684RTX 3080 Ti\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a1.5B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged\nby our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary\narithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered\nby our probe can mitigate these errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u793a\u6570\u5b57\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b0\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u7b97\u672f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

More precisely, we show that\nlinear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,\nwhen trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint\nsupports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of\nprobes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation\nvectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when\nexamined across tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLLM\u7684\u201c\u771f\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63a2\u9488\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u201c\u771f\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u660e\u663e\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002"}}

However, the underlying computational\nredundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In\nthis paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and\nidentify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional\nbranch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic\nstep-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to\nimprove efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the\ninformation gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.\nLeveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a\ntechnique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.\nNotably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies\nsignificantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,\na sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically\nselect the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate\nthe role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark\ndatasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments\nshow SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall\nacceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model\nquality.

More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to\ngenerate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.\nHowever, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily\nfocused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal\nmodels for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain\nalignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity\nrecorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with\naudio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized\ninstruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned\nMLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that\ninstruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned\nmultimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for\nboth video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear\ndisentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise\ndifferentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find\nthat MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas\nshowing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and\nlanguage regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide\nclear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the\nalignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping\njoint information processing in both the systems.

Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification\nbenchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We\nexplore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate\nlayers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series\nclassification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM\nrepresentation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further\nperformance gains achieved by combining their features.

However, aligning them to avoid\ngenerating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted\ncontent, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept\nreplacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to\n\"erase\" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have\nstarted offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt\nas input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are\nknown as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model\nto empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact\nerase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in\nemerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted\nconcepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy\nbetween T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing\nunacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs\nto generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected\nfidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of\ntargeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity.\nWe present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u66ff\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff08CRTs\uff09\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08I2I\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5AntiMirror\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u5192\u72af\u6027\u6216\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u66ff\u6362\u6280\u672f\u5728I2I\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7I2I\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u73b0\u6709CRTs\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5AntiMirror\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709CRTs\u5728I2I\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u800cAntiMirror\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66ff\u6362\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CRTs\u5728T2I\u548cI2I\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAntiMirror\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u66ff\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The method\nprovides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in\nsmart grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684VAE-LF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8865\u5168\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff08HDI\uff09\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08PLM\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\uff08PLF\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684PLM\u6570\u636e\u5bf9PLF\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "VAE-LF\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06HDI PLM\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5168\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728UK-DALE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVAE-LF\u57285%\u548c10%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0cRMSE\u548cMAE\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "VAE-LF\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8865\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This\nis because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible\ndue to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy\nconstraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework\nthat quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the\ntraining data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose\nDecentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of\ntraining and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only\nmodel parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and\ndeployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target\nsample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on\nfour medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,\nhistopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against\nexisting methods while respecting data-privacy.

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones.

It also incorporates a perplexity-based\nscoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level\nDirect Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture\nfiner-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and\nmodel performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to\nachieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets.

Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over\ntraditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context\nlearning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets.\nHowever, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational\nmodels, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains\nunderexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational\nmodels, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate\nfresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically\nevaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings\nestablish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms\nof time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters\nTabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models.\nWe reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after\ngradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of\ntest objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more\naccurately reflect their target similarity.

Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally\nimproved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater\nmemory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast\nZeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward\npasses needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that\nadapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also\naccelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector\nperturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,\nacross 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms\nMeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes.

Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to\nthe exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.\nHere, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously\noutput multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in\nan accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum\nexcited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the\nstates and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,\nthrough concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all\ninteractions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing\nmultiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,\nwe apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting\ntrapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal.

Fingerprinting and black-box\nwatermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining\nmodel similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership\ncollisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.\nThe latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of\nbackdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do\nnot convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires\na unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the\nsuspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost\nand the risk of detection.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box\nwatermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as\nthe ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight\nwe term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the\ndifference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two\nconnected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple\nselected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information\nwithout introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE\nis evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along\nwith state-of-the-art methods.

Despite their favorable theoretical\nproperties, the integration of depth measures into regression modeling to\nprovide prediction regions remains a largely underexplored area of research. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel, model-free uncertainty quantification\nalgorithm based on conditional depth measures--specifically, conditional kernel\nmean embeddings and an integrated depth measure. These new algorithms can be\nused to define prediction and tolerance regions when predictors and responses\nare defined in separable Hilbert spaces. The use of kernel mean embeddings\nensures faster convergence rates in prediction region estimation. To enhance\nthe practical utility of the algorithms with finite samples, we also introduce\na conformal prediction variant that provides marginal, non-asymptotic\nguarantees for the derived prediction regions.

This paper aims to overcome these limitations by\nproposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning\n(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into\nnumerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in\nsolving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network\ntraining, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme\nlearning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in\nPINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and\nfixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are\ndirectly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly\nenhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient\ndescent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is\ndemonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared\nto PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the\nnovel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for\none-dimensional cases, respectively.

However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity\nconstraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been\ndeveloped to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex\nconstraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed\nconstraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of\nconvergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in\nsparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of\nsparse optimization with extra \\qw{\\textit{support-preserving}} constraints\ncommonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative\nhard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection\noperator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple\nalternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By\nintroducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,\nwe provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our\nalgorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under\nthe conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a\nfundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of\nthe classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection\noperator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an\nelegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the\nzeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art\nresult from de Vazelhes et. al.

The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively\nreduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in\nmitigating cascade propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea7\u8054\u505c\u7535\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8054\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7ea7\u8054\u505c\u7535\u98ce\u9669\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aMDP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u5b88\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 14-bus\u548c118-bus\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u65ad\u5f00\u7ebf\u8def\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8054\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ebf\u8def\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u7ea7\u8054\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8054\u505c\u7535\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Traditional workflows have relied\non a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence\nAlignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments.\nHowever, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with\nhighly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and\noperates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce\nProtriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve\nrelevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When\napplied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog\nretrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector\nsearch. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly\nadapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time\n-- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Protriever\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u540c\u6e90\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMSA\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eMSA\u7684\u540c\u6e90\u5e8f\u5217\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5316\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6216\u590d\u6742\u63d2\u5165/\u5220\u9664\u6a21\u5f0f\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cProtriever\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Protriever\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u540c\u6e90\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cProtriever\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMSA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Protriever\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002"}}

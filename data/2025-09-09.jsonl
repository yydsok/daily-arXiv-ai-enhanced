Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for\ngenerating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D\ntrajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this\nwork, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating\nplausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the\ntext instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a\nreconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along\nwith a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D\nfirst reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and\nthen computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length\nwhile avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create\nvideo sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.\nThis process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion\nmodel to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic\nvideos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly\nreducing human intervention requirements.

Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized\naudio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these\nspecific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training\nand testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed\nmodel, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the\ncustomized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts.\nFurthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio\ntasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from\nreal-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks."}

Our method involves\nevolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier\ndetection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale\nvalues with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and\nsoft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their\ndiffering performance in this stress test.

Our modular\nmulti-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and\ndynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.\nUnlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to\nbottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with\nResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive\nor improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on\nsmaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with\n<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups\nof up to 1.74 times faster.

However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by\nvariations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the\nbiasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of\nthe biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant\nto a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and\nintegrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire\nbiasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information\nvolume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic\ncorrelation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and\ncalculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate\nrepresentations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,\nphrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases.

Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which\nhampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be\nunsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is\noften not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning\nwith an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying\nthe labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the\nthreshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query\nstrategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to\nmaximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between\nanomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance\nof DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of\nmislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings\nindicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others\nappear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real\nworld, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and\nthe number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query\nstrategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of\nmislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an\nactive learning-based threshold is recommended."}

While prior research has\nprimarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a\ndestination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot\nneeds to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact\nenergy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the\nObject-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses\nenergy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one\nof many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,\nwe first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a\nvariant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit\neach pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from\nhigh computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To\nmitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages\nmultiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to\nour solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of\nthe Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints.

ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured\nTCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced\ninstruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved\ninformation. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating\nthat integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization\nerror and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on\nboth collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art models.

While\nadaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,\nthey introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save\ncomputation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically\nreduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this\nconflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike\nan optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first\naddresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by\nproposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep\nparameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields\ncompact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical\nsynchronization issues affecting dynamic inference.

Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across\nsensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state\nLiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on\nhandheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we\npropose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on\nsensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a\nKalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with\nLiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We\npropose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model\nfor IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map\napproach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR\nregistration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive\nexperiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used\nrobotic sensors and platforms.

Recently, researchers\nhave successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\nprogrammatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based\npolicies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.\nInspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating\nprogrammatic policies in multi-player games.

The Local Pool\nstores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently\nhigh-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The\nPolicy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top\nthree policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the\ncurrent iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy\nusing feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited\ninto the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves\na sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it\nis integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction\ndata from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes\ndirectional improvements to guide the Policy Planner"}

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction.

In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents\nmaintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under\ndifferent experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to\n(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic\ndialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral\nhypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent\nwith what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on\nthese hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model\nfamilies and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although\nagents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they\nfail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their\ncapabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject\nresearch.

Furthermore, a composite loss function,\nwhich combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect\nreconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation\nof frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models\nwith varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy\nand practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:\nfalse alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial\nfibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and\nECG signals."}

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive\nartifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and\ndiscovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into\ndynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for\nknowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI\nco-scientists."}

This environment\nleverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a\nvast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To\nmaster this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by\ndynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step\nthrough operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training\nwith a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and\nenables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior.

This deviates from the expectation that the model should\nincrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data\nstreams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples.

Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams\nclosely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher\nresolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive\nparameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application\nrequirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time\noperation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based\nvision research and early-stage system development.\n  The codes are available online:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/raw2event-BFF2/README.md."}

However,\nsince we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in\npreserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with\nmulti-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization\nmodels. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization\nframework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and\nalleviate identity confusion with scalability. With \"multi-to-multi matching\"\nparadigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment\noptimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing\nimage customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on\ndiffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable\ncustomization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both\nsynthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure\nidentity confusion.

One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant\nchallenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The\ntest case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known\nTransparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on\nthe cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the\nresults show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly\nimproved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and\nmean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between\npreserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy."}

Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that\nleverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the\ndomain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped\nonto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen\ndomain samples are projected similarly before predictions.

This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring\n(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray\nimages, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research\nuniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length\nimage sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured\ninto four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,\nII) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and\nIV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,\nEfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance\nwith Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute\nerror (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS\nfrom two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed\n3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227\nvalidation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our\njoint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,\nViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can\nsignificantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge\nof joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,\nreduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and\naids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions."}

Prior\nhyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix\nfactorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and\nspectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based\nmodel that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while\npreserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes\nfive multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at\nthe same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors\ngrow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To\naddress this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively\nexpands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.\nMoreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and\norders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise\nrelations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our\nmodel achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,\noutperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by\nmore than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical\nvalue of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification\nand burnt area segmentation."}

Early detection of nitrogen stress is\ntherefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective\nmanagement strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to\naccurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.\nOur model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,\nand two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant\nresponses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,\ndocument plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,\nmedium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of\nour approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images\nwith a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.\nWe also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison.

One prominent line of research addresses these\nlimitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically\nreshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These\nimages can then be classified based on their textural information using\ncomputer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware\nmore effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D\nimages results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,\ncaused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D\ndependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal\nlimits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work\naddresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which\navoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not\nsuffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.\nIt is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to\nclassify these 1D signals for improved performance.

However, the high computational costs of these video\npose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering\nframework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient\ntransformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with\nprogressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering\nfull-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate\ntransformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two\nkey modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module\n(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the\nredundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal\ninformation based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output\nto the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method\nis general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on\nboth seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different\ntoken pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that\nmaintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of\nrepresentative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

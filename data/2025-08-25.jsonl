With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven\nbenchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared\nwith baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text\npairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,\nScience, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and\ntextual scientific content.

To bridge this gap, we\npropose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by\nextending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving\nperformance improvements of up to 11%.

The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various\nmathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to\nintroduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric\nspaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In\nparticular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced\nthe notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the\nbase space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the\nrepresentation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general\ntheory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations\nthat produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the\ngroup theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric\nspaces $\\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its\nnormal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the\ngenus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient\nautomorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of\nthe Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces\n$\\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in\nterms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups.

We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and\namplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion.

While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker\narchitecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken\nresponses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA\nbenchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in\ncontextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency."}

Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge\nconcepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts\nbelieved to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,\nerror-prone, or overly general.\n  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary\nrepresentations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence\nof a latent concept.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

As a\nkey enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in\nthis work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object\n3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate\nthis with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover\nhand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely\non pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches\nstate-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D\ntransformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment\non sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen\nobject categories."}

We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated.

However,\nacquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to\nbypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to\nreconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require\nadditional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose\nUnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation\nand reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a\npre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D\nframe, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model\nusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise\nepistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly\noutperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D\nreconstruction quality.

The agent\nwas successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved\nmarking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video\nsequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural\nactivations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the\nagent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these\noscillations with high amplitudes.

We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,\n(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including\nhedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last\nExam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a\nsaturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of\nuncertainty (e.g., $\\textit{guess}$, $\\textit{stuck}$, $\\textit{hard}$) in the\nCoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the\nCoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is\ninformative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\\approx 70\\%$),\nand carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\\approx 9\\%$), indicating that CoT\nlength predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,\ni.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.\nFinally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more\nsalient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than\ncorrect responses.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results\nwith only a single step."}

Consequently, the\nexact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of\nthe features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where\nthe number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a\nleast-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the\ninterpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results\nhold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients\nand has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic\nregression and kernel Poisson regression.

This is achieved by integrating system-led\noptimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to\nintervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's\nreasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user\nagency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance\ncompared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing\ncooperative method with lower cognitive load."}

We introduce\nRankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines\nregression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query\nitem and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the\nbase regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance\nweighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,\nRankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using\nonly 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language\nmodel (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or\ngeneral-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse\ndomains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in\nlow-data settings."}

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer\nto RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems."}

Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can\nrestore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to\n15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and\na clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)\nDirection shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value\nmagnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and\nsmallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)\nStronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones\nresist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD\nperformance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than\nfinding new solutions.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results\nwith only a single step."}

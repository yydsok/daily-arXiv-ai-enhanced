Traditional synchronisation-based systems perform well under clean\nconditions but degrade sharply in first-person recordings. Conversely,\nface-voice association (FVA)-based methods forgo synchronisation modelling in\nfavour of cross-modal biometric matching, exhibiting robustness to transient\nvisual corruption but suffering when overlapping speech or front-end\nsegmentation errors occur. In this paper, a simple yet effective ensemble\napproach is proposed to fuse synchronisation-dependent and\nsynchronisation-agnostic model outputs via weighted averaging, thereby\nharnessing complementary cues without introducing complex fusion architectures.\nA refined preprocessing pipeline for the FVA-based component is also introduced\nto optimise ensemble integration. Experiments on the Ego4D-AVD validation set\ndemonstrate that the ensemble attains 70.2% and 66.7% mean Average Precision\n(mAP) with TalkNet and Light-ASD backbones, respectively.

In particular, we verify\nthis on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and\ndemodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform\nbut in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary\nprocesses generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among\noscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual\nsynchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective\nresonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or\nstructural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both\nmechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra\nover several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto\ncritical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the\ncross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical\nperformances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a\ncommon underlying structure.

This study underscores the necessity of\nfine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after\nfine-tuning.

Experiments on time series models typically focus on\ndemonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline\nsolutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and\naccuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,\nTemporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on\npublic data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show\nthat ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or\neven improving) forecast accuracy.

Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or\naudiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine\nlearning models.

Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open\nsource datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of\naudiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound\nrecognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available\ndataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model\ncomparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones\nconnected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with\nhearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene\nrecognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of\n0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of\naudiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning\nfrom the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time\nsound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+\nto an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest\nspecifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately\n50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms\nper 1 second of audio.

On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain\noutdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with\ncontemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,\nor artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation\npatterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model\ndesign strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a\ncontemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating\nMLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based\nmisinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different\narchitectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection\nmethods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic\ndetection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new\ncontent to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable\ninsights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation\ndetection.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error\ntrajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate\nself-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data\nserve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our\nparadigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,\nuncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel\nbegins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance\nour monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE\nand RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success\nrates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%\nand 16.4%.

The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)\nis commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended\nquestions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a\nnegative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions\nprovide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require\ntime-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether\nlarge language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We\nused a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain\ninjury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their\nopen-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these\nresponses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested\nthe fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed\nthat model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions\nof hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher\nalignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and\naccidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group\ndifferences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI\nand HC groups.

A persisting challenge\nis model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more\nmixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we\ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for\noverspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown\n$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the\npopulation level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we\nestablish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nsteps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe\nsublinear convergence in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample\nlevel, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we\ndemonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with\nsufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$\ngiven $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:\nHATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes\nthreshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy\nalgorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By\nconnecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold\nscheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in\nheterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods\nsignificantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and\nhigher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks.

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work\nfocuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either\nwith large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.\nInstead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that\nfilters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while\nkeeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,\nwe propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for\nactions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper\nstate.

Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate\nPoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head\npose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing\ncalibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.\nSpecifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial\nimages from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or\ncontinuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically\nanalyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences\nestimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of\nhead poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose\nvariation.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating\ntext-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The\napproach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong\ncross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and\nimage. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge\nsketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.\nThis enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated\nimages. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive\nloss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A\nmulti-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic\nconsistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic\nexperiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset.

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels.

However,\nthe deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty\nwheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international\nstandards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment.

(2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and\ngenerate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a\nchallenging dataset for robust training.

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor.

It proposes an adaptive resource\norchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method\nintroduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows\ndifferent resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and\nschedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better\nable to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental\ncharacteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to\nintegrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy\nlearning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time\nlocal performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism\nimproves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A\nunified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a\nrepresentative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key\nmetrics.

This result\nmakes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an\ninteraction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in\nsocial robots with social cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u732e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u81ea\u6211\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728F1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.83\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e860.48\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc6\u522b\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u793e\u4ea4\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability.

This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where\ndecisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand\nnot only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to\nensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional\nfederated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize\nprimarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving\nCoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,\nexisting methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating\nknowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication\noverhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We\naddresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed\nto enhance reasoning in federated settings.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel\nframework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation\nfine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal\nsubspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's\nrepresentation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition\nstrategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering\ndirections with a shared subspace for common steering directions.

However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep\nsemantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional\napproaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,\nwhich often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in\nrecommendations that may not align with user expectations.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender\ncentered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided\ncontext-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches.

Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models\n(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by\ncarefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect\neach other without degrading image quality.

The first layer (near\nEdge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or\nOne Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far\nEdge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024\ndataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first\nlayer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,\nensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba.

The research presented herein addresses these\ninterconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL\nframework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial\nexperiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,\nresulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first\nintegrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek\nLinks (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically\nuseful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using\na tuned FedProx algorithm.

We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,\n$\\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein\ndistance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a\nFaithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence\nKL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \\textbf{Semantic\nExploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.\nThese metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic\nframework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,\nconfident confabulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial\nrevisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in\nfostering inclusive narratives.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes.

This study\npresents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical\ntargets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of\nsimulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the\nclinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through\na novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid\nin catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft\nHoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated\ninsertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,\nwhere planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and\nreal-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is\nprovided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed\ntomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation\nof insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.\nSystem Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.\nTool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy\nmeasures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

Existing methods rely\non auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier\ninformation for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with\nreal test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic\nsupervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a\nnovel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP\naugments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external\nknowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During\ntraining, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint\nsimilarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's\nOOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time\nbased on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to\nthe test environment.

However, current methods frequently produce videos\nwith motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit\nmodeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit\narticulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial\nmovements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically\ndefined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize\nphoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement\nModule (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while\npredicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate\nidentity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject\ngeneralization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This\nmodule dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing\nidentity-agnostic learning.

However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google\nTranslate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation\nmodels (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and\neffectiveness in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u6297\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ed1\u76d2API\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u9650\u5236\u6216\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ea7\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u6458\u8981\u3001\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700100\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "CEMA\u5728\u5546\u4e1aAPI\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind.

The final Version of Record will appear in the MICCAI 2025\n  proceedings (Springer LNCS)", "summary": "Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed\ntomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis\nand treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved\nnotable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to\nsuppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary\nKernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain\nprocessing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural\npreservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and\ntrainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both\nspatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual\nunderstanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while\nmaintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that\nFIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art\nMAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR\nimprovement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's\nability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively\nsuppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's\npotential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural\npreservation and improved clinical applicability.

In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any\nexisting public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all\nnewly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure\nno identity leakage. Our method achieves \\textbf{1st place} in the competition,\nand experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance\nacross 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales.

It\nrequires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in\noccluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many\nexisting methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views\nor train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.\nAdditionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.\nThis gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view\ntranslation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative\ncapabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from\na novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ\na camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted\nlatent corresponding to the desired target view.

However, they still\nstruggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects\nspecified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely\non either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity\nrepresentations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they\nstill have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects\nand overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object\ninstances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps\nof the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image\ngeneration, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at\nthe early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region\nshould be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose\n\\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to\nbe clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without\nrelying on any external tools or additional training.

While autoregressive generative\nmodels are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,\nwhich contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent\nstudies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means\nclustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative\nmodels with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering\nperforms poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including\ntoken space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we\npropose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to\nk-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token\nsimilarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly\nused centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate\nfor the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.\nUsing an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space\ndisparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating\nlow-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play\nand integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms.

It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,\nspanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and\ncounting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support\nfine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,\nwhether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to\ndomains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.\nFurthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \\eg, fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and\nour accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing\ndomain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding.

Current deepfake detection methods\nperform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to\ndatasets with unknown forgery techniques.

This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake\ndetection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative\nforgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided\nLearning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously\nadapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures\nthe differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,\nallowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To\nfurther improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual\nPerception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships\namong forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically\nperceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery\ntechniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then\nintegrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In\naddition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the\nentire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of\nforgery trace correlations.

We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the\nacceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the\nVBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from\n0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further\ncorroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Here we challenge this view by\nestablishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally\ndifferent computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal\ndynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In\ncontrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the\nrepresentational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their\nartificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including\nclassification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.\n  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment\nbetween input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,\noffers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in\nneuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration\ndynamic.

To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact.

This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases.

Project\n  page: https://nirvanalan.github.io/projects/stream3r", "summary": "We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates\npointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on\nexpensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that\nscale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an\nstreaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal\nattention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning\ngeometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to\ndiverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional\nmethods often fail.

In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a\npromising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the\nrelevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of\nestimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full\ntemperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on\nsynthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the\nestimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are\nable to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative\nerror of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u4f30\u8ba1IGBT\u6a21\u5757\u710a\u6599\u5c42\u9000\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cfIGBT\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9000\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7ed3\u6e29\u3001\u710a\u6599\u75b2\u52b3\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7269\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u710a\u6599\u9000\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u710a\u6599\u9000\u5316\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.17%\uff0cIGBT\u8868\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u5927\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a4.56%\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee0.37%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u6280\u672f\u4e3aIGBT\u6a21\u5757\u9000\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Much research is\navailable on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high\ndimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a\nchallenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in\nattractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we\ncomprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield\nnetwork undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to\nformation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show\nthat, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce\na pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new\nattractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an\nabrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful\nlearning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point\nattractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles.

We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This\ndesign is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two\nintuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with\nNeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead.

Thus, to address the\nrequirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as\nwell as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to\nvariations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a\nseries of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including\ntime series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time\nseries classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on\nthe performance of Echo State Network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ESN\uff09\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u914d\u7f6e\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u586b\u8865\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3ESN\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30ESN\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9ESN\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u914d\u7f6e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aESN\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u5feb\u901f\u638c\u63e1\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u3002"}}

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system\nprompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate\nthat rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors\nreduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental\ntrade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work\nfailed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention\narchitectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and\ncross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show\nhow anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy\nobjectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification\narchitecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule\nsets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs.

This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional\nsemantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and\nsource. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,\ninteroperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable\nfor dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is\nthen processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic\nannotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,\nincluding the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are\nproposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the\ninteroperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the\nsynonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the\ntransportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or\ncloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,\nBluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is\nproposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,\nDempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nis proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor\nIoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred.

KV quantization is a key\nlever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV\ndistribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior\nwork focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten\nthe overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.\nIn this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that\nevolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic\nregularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a\npattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern\nvectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes\nonly the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the\nquantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of\nlow-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on\nmultiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%\naverage 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%\non average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger\nbatches."}

Here, we address this challenge by\ndeveloping a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network\npathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and\nnodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This\nyields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to\nadopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge\noften only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the\nmore asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes\ncanonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning\nnetwork regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration\n- prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other.\nEmergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from\nthe network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models.

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities\nfrom their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student\nillustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human\ndescription of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels.

We evaluate AInstein on\n1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),\nusing an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by\ntargeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success\nRate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with\nhuman-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original\napproaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible\nsolutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving\nability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide\nthe first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as\nautonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential\nand their current limitations."}

This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that\nrefine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared\ngated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its\nlimited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,\nrecognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic\nstructure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes\nlearning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by\nlowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary\ntemperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting\ninsufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on\nscale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and\ndiverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while\nsignificantly improving both training and inference efficiency."}

The performance gap stems from the fact that\nautoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered\npoint sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local\npredictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities.

The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of\nits loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function\nin adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its\nregularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization\nbetween two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness\nin adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea\nof mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose\ntwo novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)\nweighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization\nregularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control\nover the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and\nauxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target\ndistribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization\nand enhancing model robustness.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

A major\nchallenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as\nunfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer\noverflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet\nloss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a\ncomplex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that\ndoes not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong\nreasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through\nIn-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural\nlanguage prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM\nmodels have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In\nthis paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities\ncontrol for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss.

Besides for\nunsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment\nas a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We\nshow that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient\ndownstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of\nempowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's\ncontrol over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging\nthis formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes\npolicies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a\nrobust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based\npre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its\npotential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing\npolicies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to\nimproved adaptability in downstream tasks.

To enable practical deployment at scale, we\ndevelop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that\nstrategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.\nExperiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently\noutperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency\nthan Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while\nmaintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that\northogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than\ncompeting approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale\ndeep learning."}

This is because system performance problems naturally admit\nreliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or\nsimulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts\nagainst predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach\nas AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,\nevaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS\ninstance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load\nbalancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,\nLLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS\ndiscovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,\nachieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill\nbest practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator\nconstruction, for existing frameworks.

Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and\neven topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse\nin-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and\nreduces failure modes compared with the baselines."}

This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues.

The key\ninnovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the\nDSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected\nreturns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human\nintervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is\neffectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state\nspace, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical\ntraining times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient\nlearning for autonomous driving."}

Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies.

At the same\ntime, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies\nremains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the\nbaseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,\nwhile maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)\nreasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting\nthat the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further\ninvestigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design\nthat pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic\nReasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular\nreasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is\ndiscovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple\nCoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution\ntraces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which\ncan be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned\nmeta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually\ndesigned MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,\nMASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high\nperformance across different foundation models and task domains without further\noptimization."}

However, LLMs have\nlargely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy\nthem in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular\nsafety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on\nconstrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based\n(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of\nenvironments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in\na principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning\nenvironments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained\nproblems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to\nsolve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of\nsupported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment\ngenerators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This\nrenders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems\ncan be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve.

The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization\ncan, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also\noccur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well\nenough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using\ngeometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using\na summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point\nsampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations\nto avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made.\nStability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable\ntrust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the\ngrowth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes\nprove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational\ntime on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published\ndata set of chemical reactions.

We first use it to\ndirectly optimize internal model parameters. We then apply the algorithm to the\nweights of each member of a supermodel ensemble to optimize the overall\npredictions. In both cases, the algorithm is able to find parameters which\nresult in reduced errors in the climatology of the model. Finally, we introduce\na novel approach which combines both methods called adaptive supermodeling,\nwhere the internal parameters of the members of a supermodel are tuned\nsimultaneously with the model weights such that the supermodel predictions are\noptimized. For a case designed to challenge the two previous methods, adaptive\nsupermodeling achieves a performance similar to a perfect model."}

Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a\nhallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \\textbf{commitment\nlayer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from\nfactuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We\nobserve a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret\nusing the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \\textbf{associative\npathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \\textbf{contextual pathway}\n(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as\n\\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}.

End-to-end\nfeedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through\nargmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight\naveraging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and\ncross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline\naccuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with\nstable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by\n31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains\neffective with token interfaces and models."}

As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows\nexponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.\nTherefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide\nexploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present\nReference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill\ndiscovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD\nfirst performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,\nclustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding\nenables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference\nbehaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a\nsimulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns\nstructured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and\nalso discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD\noutperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest\nthat lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to\ndiscovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems."}

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents."}

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance."}

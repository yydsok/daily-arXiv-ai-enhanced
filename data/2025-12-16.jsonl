This study investigates how AI agents navigate network-effect games, where individual payoffs depend on peer participatio--a context underexplored in multi-agent systems despite its real-world prevalence. We introduce a novel workflow design using large language model (LLM)-based agents in repeated decision-making scenarios, systematically manipulating price trajectories (fixed, ascending, descending, random) and network-effect strength. Our key findings include: First, without historical data, agents fail to infer equilibrium. Second, ordered historical sequences (e.g., escalating prices) enable partial convergence under weak network effects but strong effects trigger persistent \"AI optimism\"--agents overestimate participation despite contradictory evidence. Third, randomized history disrupts convergence entirely, demonstrating that temporal coherence in data shapes LLMs' reasoning, unlike humans. These results highlight a paradigm shift: in AI-mediated systems, equilibrium outcomes depend not just on incentives, but on how history is curated, which is impossible for human."}

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties."}

This transition is hindered by the velocity of research, evolving NIST standards, and heterogeneous deployment environments. To address this, we present Quantigence, a theory-driven multi-agent AI framework for structured quantum-security analysis. Quantigence decomposes research objectives into specialized roles - Cryptographic Analyst, Threat Modeler, Standards Specialist, and Risk Assessor - coordinated by a supervisory agent. Using \"cognitive parallelism,\" agents reason independently to maintain context purity while execution is serialized on resource-constrained hardware (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2060). The framework integrates external knowledge via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and prioritizes vulnerabilities using the Quantum-Adjusted Risk Score (QARS), a formal extension of Mosca's Theorem.

To address these challenges in the complex environment of roundabout intersections, this paper proposes a roundabout control algorithm, which takes into account the uncertainty of interactive information caused by time delays. First, to maintain the required distance between the current vehicle and its preceding and following vehicles, conflicting vehicles are identified based on the time-to-collision (TTC) in the conflict zone. To fully consider communication performance, a vehicle motion model incorporating time delays is established. According to the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) mechanism, the vehicle motion control that satisfies the roundabout constraints is determined. Second, by scheduling the sequence of vehicles entering the roundabout, a multiscale optimization objective is developed by integrating vehicle motion indicators and roundabout system indicators. Traffic density and travel time are embedded into the optimization problem to guide vehicles to enter the roundabout safely and stably. Through a variety of simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with that of multiple control algorithms under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates and heavy traffic load scenarios."}

This paper presents a field dataset and behavioral analysis of Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC), a mature ADAS that perceives traffic lights and stop signs. We design and execute experiments across varied speed limits and TCD types, collecting synchronized high-resolution vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. From these data, we develop a taxonomy of TLSSC-TCD interaction behaviors (i.e., stopping, accelerating, and car following) and calibrate the Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) to quantitatively characterize each behavior mode. A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative. Intersection car-following behavior exhibits smoother dynamics and tighter headways compared to standard car-following behaviors. The established dataset, behavior definitions, and model characterizations together provide a foundation for future simulation, safety evaluation, and design of ADAS-TCD interaction logic.

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

Results show that although converted speech outputs produce by those models appear plausible, they exhibit insufficient similarity with the target speaker characteristics. We introduce an efficient frequency warping technique that can be applied to the output of models, and which shows significant reduction of the mismatch between adult and child.

Existing methods produce short, disjointed clips, failing to align visuals with musical structure, beats, or lyrics, and lack temporal consistency.

AutoMV first applies music processing tools to extract musical attributes, such as structure, vocal tracks, and time-aligned lyrics, and constructs these features as contextual inputs for following agents. The screenwriter Agent and director Agent then use this information to design short script, define character profiles in a shared external bank, and specify camera instructions. Subsequently, these agents call the image generator for keyframes and different video generators for \"story\" or \"singer\" scenes. A Verifier Agent evaluates their output, enabling multi-agent collaboration to produce a coherent longform MV. To evaluate M2V generation, we further propose a benchmark with four high-level categories (Music Content, Technical, Post-production, Art) and twelve ine-grained criteria. This benchmark was applied to compare commercial products, AutoMV, and human-directed MVs with expert human raters: AutoMV outperforms current baselines significantly across all four categories, narrowing the gap to professional MVs. Finally, we investigate using large multimodal models as automatic MV judges; while promising, they still lag behind human expert, highlighting room for future work."}

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting."}

However, existing datasets fall short in one or more of these dimensions, limiting strict and comprehensive evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce JointAVBench, a novel benchmark with strict audio-video correlation, spanning five cognitive dimensions, four audio information types (speech, sound events, music, vocal traits), and three scene spans (single-, cross-, and full-scene).

Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance.

Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies. Participant's surveys indicated that they recognized their own retreating tactics, and resulted in an overall higher player-satisfaction for Mirror Mode. Refining the model further may improve imitation quality and increase player's satisfaction, especially when players face their own strategies.

While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools. The lack of dedicated resources is particularly acute for business documents, which are critical for both public administration and private enterprise. To address this gap, we present \\textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols. This multi-level approach supports both comprehensive layout analysis and precise information extraction. We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts.

While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels.

However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space."}

However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems."}

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems."}

Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs."}

Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring.

This thesis presents a traversability-aware navigation framework for the M4 robot platform that uses learned terrain analysis to generate energy-efficient paths avoiding difficult terrain.Our approach uses FAST-LIO for real-time localization, generating 2.5D elevation maps from LiDAR point clouds. A CNN-based model processes these elevation maps to estimate traversability scores, which are converted into navigation costs for path planning. A custom A* planner incorporates these costs alongside geometric distance and energy consumption to find paths that trade modest distance increases for substantial terrain quality improvements. Before system development, a platform-agnostic study compared LiDAR-based and camera-based SLAM using OptiTrack ground truth. Point cloud comparison through ICP alignment and cloud-to-mesh distance analysis demonstrated that LiDAR-based mapping achieves centimeter-level precision essential for elevation mapping, while camera-based approaches exhibited significantly higher geometric error. These findings directly resulted in the selection of LiDAR as the primary sensor to generate elevation maps. The complete pipeline integrates FAST-LIO localization, GPU-accelerated elevation mapping, CNN-based traversability estimation, and Nav2 navigation with a custom traversability-aware planner. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids low traversability regions and accepts a few longer paths to achieve a reduction in terrain cost.

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs."}

The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%.

However, existing detection methods are fundamentally limited by the quality of available datasets, many of which rely on outdated synthesis systems and generation procedures that introduce dataset-specific artifacts rather than realistic manipulation cues. To address this gap, we introduce HQ-MPSD, a high-quality multilingual partial deepfake speech dataset. HQ-MPSD is constructed using linguistically coherent splice points derived from fine-grained forced alignment, preserving prosodic and semantic continuity and minimizing audible and visual boundary artifacts. The dataset contains 350.8 hours of speech across eight languages and 550 speakers, with background effects added to better reflect real-world acoustic conditions. MOS evaluations and spectrogram analysis confirm the high perceptual naturalness of the samples. We benchmark state-of-the-art detection models through cross-language and cross-dataset evaluations, and all models experience performance drops exceeding 80% on HQ-MPSD. These results demonstrate that HQ-MPSD exposes significant generalization challenges once low-level artifacts are removed and multilingual and acoustic diversity are introduced, providing a more realistic and demanding benchmark for partial deepfake detection.

However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.\n  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices."}

Each agent has to decide on one of a finite set of identical machines to get their job processed. In contrast to the common and exclusive focus on makespan minimization, we want the outcome to be fair under strategic considerations of the agents. Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization. For our positive results, we develop a unified algorithmic approach, where we achieve different properties by fine-tuning key subroutines."}

We find that autoregressive language models, from token prediction to sequence-to-sequence tasks, are remarkably resilient (for GPT-2, test NLL increases modestly from 2.87 to 3.59 despite 50% token corruption). By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics. These analyses suggest that robustness is heavily influenced by two key principles: the richness of conditioning information, which constrains the learning problem, and the absolute information content of the training data, which allows the signal from correct information to dominate statistical noise."}

However, assessing their accuracy and reliability remains a challenge. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3. Our findings show that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and accurate alternative to traditional human evaluation for benchmarking contextual understanding in ConvQA systems."}

Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches."}

To address model discrepancies not captured by the reduced-order space, and learn the structure of model deviation, we incorporate a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) constrained to be an orthogonal complement of the best-knowledge manifold. This ensures that the learned correction targets only the unknown components of model bias, preserving the interpretability and fidelity of the physical model. An optimal sensor placement strategy is also investigated to maximize information gained from measurements. We validate the proposed approach on a representative problem involving the Helmholtz equation under various sources of modeling error, including those arising from boundary conditions and source terms."}

However, since standard codecs tightly couple timbre and prosody, continuation-based LMs inevitably replicate this entanglement, hindering independent control. Recent efforts attempt to break this entanglement via codec design, but insufficient decoupling remains a critical bottleneck. To tackle this challenge, we propose DisCo-Speech, a zero-shot controllable TTS framework that enables prosody control and voice cloning via a disentangled speech codec (DisCodec) and an LM-based generator. The core component, DisCodec, contains two core stages: 1) Tri-factor disentanglement, which explicitly factorizes speech into content, prosody, and timbre subspaces via parallel encoders and hybrid losses; and 2) Fusion and reconstruction, which fuses content and prosody into unified content-prosody tokens suitable for LM prediction, while jointly optimizing reconstruction quality to resolve the disentanglement-reconstruction trade-off. With this design, the LM performs prosodic continuation from a style prompt while the decoder handles target timbre injection, enabling flexible zero-shot control. Experiments show that DisCo-Speech matches state-of-the-art voice cloning performance while outperforming baselines in zero-shot prosody control. By resolving the core entanglement at the codec level, DisCo-Speech provides a robust foundation for controllable speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at https://github.com/disco-speech/DisCo-Speech, and the code and weights will be released at the same link."}

We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation.

The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs. Furthermore, we explore sparsity-aware training as a natural extension, showing that models can be trained to be inherently more robust to sparse attention patterns, pushing the accuracy-sparsity frontier even further."}

Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions. By making these empirical datasets openly available, this work offers researchers a unique opportunity to develop, test, and validate models that more accurately represent complex urban traffic environments."}

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe."}

Existing methods produce short, disjointed clips, failing to align visuals with musical structure, beats, or lyrics, and lack temporal consistency. We propose AutoMV, a multi-agent system that generates full music videos (MVs) directly from a song. AutoMV first applies music processing tools to extract musical attributes, such as structure, vocal tracks, and time-aligned lyrics, and constructs these features as contextual inputs for following agents. The screenwriter Agent and director Agent then use this information to design short script, define character profiles in a shared external bank, and specify camera instructions. Subsequently, these agents call the image generator for keyframes and different video generators for \"story\" or \"singer\" scenes. A Verifier Agent evaluates their output, enabling multi-agent collaboration to produce a coherent longform MV. To evaluate M2V generation, we further propose a benchmark with four high-level categories (Music Content, Technical, Post-production, Art) and twelve ine-grained criteria. This benchmark was applied to compare commercial products, AutoMV, and human-directed MVs with expert human raters: AutoMV outperforms current baselines significantly across all four categories, narrowing the gap to professional MVs. Finally, we investigate using large multimodal models as automatic MV judges; while promising, they still lag behind human expert, highlighting room for future work."}

As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination.

While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees. Together, these contributions establish the connection between hypergame theory, multi-agent systems, and strategic AI."}

In this paper we introduce Aion, a framework that embeds temporal flow dynamics directly within a hierarchical 3DSG, effectively incorporating the temporal dimension. Aion employs a graph-based sparse MoD representation to capture motion flows over arbitrary time intervals and attaches them to navigational nodes in the scene graph, yielding more interpretable and scalable predictions that improve planning and interaction in complex dynamic environments."}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

A Unified Benchmark for Typographic-Attack Robustness and Text Recognition in Vision-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/."}

However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design."}

EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. The framework leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate relevant contextual knowledge without requiring retraining. We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods.

Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions.

Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks.

We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use. These findings suggest that passive smartphone sensing could serve as a powerful, ecologically valid methodology for studying the dynamics of affective behavior and open the door to understanding this behavior at a population scale."}

Real-world mobility is highly non-stationary: abrupt turns, rapid speed changes, and unpredictable user behavior cause conventional predictors to drift, leading to mistimed or failed handovers. We propose a lightweight meta-continual forecasting framework that integrates a GRU-based predictor, Reptile meta-initialization for fast few-shot adaptation, and an EWMA residual detector that triggers compact online updates only when drift occurs. Evaluated on a reproducible GeoLife and DeepMIMO pipeline, our method achieves 4.46 m ADE and 7.79 m FDE in zero-shot settings, improves few-shot ADE to 3.71 m at 10-shot, and enables recovery from abrupt drift about 2 to 3 times faster than an offline GRU. When applied to downstream HO prediction, the approach improves F1 to 0.83 and AUROC to 0.90, with substantial reductions in missed-HO and ping-pong events. The model is lightweight (128k parameters) and suitable for edge deployment in 5G and 6G systems."}

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation."}

Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing.

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

A kinematic single-track model is derived to describe the low-speed motion of the vehicle, which is subsequently used as the motion model in the Hybrid A* path-planning algorithm to generate feasible motion primitive branches.

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor."}

Existing work focuses on the study of homogeneous GNNs and little attention has been given to topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). In this work, firstly, in order to distinguish distinct meta relations, we apply meta-weighting to the adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous graph. Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning. Experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving HGNNs' performance and debiasing."}

However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels. TopK-SD outperforms original TopK sampling on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides a new perspective for understanding the working mechanisms within ICL."}

The potential existence of valuable resources at the lunar South Pole has made landing in that region a high priority for many space agencies and commercial companies. However, relying on a LiDAR for hazard detection during descent is risky, as this technology is fairly untested in the lunar environment.\n  There exists a rich log of lunar surface data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which could be used to create informative prior maps of the surface before descent. In this work, we propose a method for generating stochastic elevation maps from LRO data using Gaussian processes (GPs), which are a powerful Bayesian framework for non-parametric modeling that produce accompanying uncertainty estimates. In high-risk environments such as autonomous spaceflight, interpretable estimates of terrain uncertainty are critical. However, no previous approaches to stochastic elevation mapping have taken LRO Digital Elevation Model (DEM) confidence maps into account, despite this data containing key information about the quality of the DEM in different areas.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage GP model in which a secondary GP learns spatially varying noise characteristics from DEM confidence data. This heteroscedastic information is then used to inform the noise parameters for the primary GP, which models the lunar terrain. Additionally, we use stochastic variational GPs to enable scalable training. By leveraging GPs, we are able to more accurately model the impact of heteroscedastic sensor noise on the resulting elevation map. As a result, our method produces more informative terrain uncertainty, which can be used for downstream tasks such as hazard detection and safe landing site selection."}

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning."}

These advancements not only enhance the flexibility and accuracy of IE systems but also pave the way for lightweight and efficient IE paradigms."}

There are two major issues with cell paint: (1) it is labor-intensive and (2) it requires chemical fixation, making the study of cell dynamics impossible. We train a diffusion model (Morphological Observation Neural Enhancement Tool, or MONET) on a large dataset to predict cell paint channels from brightfield images. We show that model quality improves with scale. The model uses a consistency architecture to generate time-lapse videos, despite the impossibility of obtaining cell paint video training data. In addition, we show that this architecture enables a form of in-context learning, allowing the model to partially transfer to out-of-distribution cell lines and imaging protocols. Virtual cell painting is not intended to replace physical cell painting completely, but to act as a complementary tool enabling novel workflows in biological research."}

The use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms is often studied as a method to map out the surface of an RSO and find the inspector's relative pose using a lidar or conventional camera. However, conventional cameras struggle during eclipse or shadowed periods, and lidar, though robust to lighting conditions, tends to be heavier, bulkier, and more power-intensive. Thermal-infrared cameras can track the target RSO throughout difficult illumination conditions without these limitations. While useful, thermal-infrared imagery lacks the resolution and feature-richness of visible cameras. In this work, images of a target satellite in low Earth orbit are photo-realistically simulated in both visible and thermal-infrared bands. Pixel-level fusion methods are used to create visible/thermal-infrared composites that leverage the best aspects of each camera.

In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli."}

PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC.

This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment.

Here we present a unified mathematical framework in which diverse cognitive processes emerge from a single geometric principle. We represent the cognitive state as a point on a differentiable manifold endowed with a learned Riemannian metric that encodes representational constraints, computational costs, and structural relations among cognitive variables. A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures. We derive analytical conditions for these regimes and demonstrate their behavioural signatures through simulations of canonical cognitive tasks. Together, these results establish a geometric foundation for cognition and suggest guiding principles for the development of more general and human-like artificial intelligence systems."}

While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance."}

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics.

To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate). Deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 yielded an average inference latency of 112 ms, and on an iPhone 16 yielded 23.5 ms, confirming the feasibility for edge computation. This work demonstrates a practical approach for objective, real-time training intensity feedback using minimal hardware, paving the way for accessible AI-driven hypertrophy coaching tools that help users manage intensity and fatigue effectively."}

Existing SLAM frameworks typically rely on geometric distance or temporal metrics for memory management, often resulting in inefficient data retrieval in spatially compartmentalized environments. To address this, we propose a semantic zone-based 3D map management method that shifts the paradigm from geometry-centric to semantics-centric control. Our approach partitions the environment into meaningful spatial units (e.g., lobbies, hallways) and designates these zones as the primary unit for memory management. By dynamically loading only task-relevant zones into Working Memory (WM) and offloading inactive zones to Long-Term Memory (LTM), the system strictly enforces user-defined memory thresholds. Implemented within the RTAB-Map framework, our method demonstrates substantial reductions in unnecessary signature load/unload cycles and cumulative memory utilization compared to standard approaches. The results confirm that semantic zone-based management ensures stable, predictable memory usage while preserving map availability for navigation.

In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes.

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to existing approaches across diverse applications and system configurations."}

Under minimal domain-agnostic assumptions, we show that intelligent systems undergo a sharp transition from high-entropy adaptive regimes to low-entropy collapsed regimes.

In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost localization pipeline for buoyancy-driven microFloats operating in coastal waters. We build upon previous work by introducing a bidirectional acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF) localization framework, which incorporates both float-to-buoy and buoy-to-float transmissions, thereby increasing the number of usable measurements. The method integrates nonlinear trilateration with a filtering of computed position estimates based on geometric cost and Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB). This approach removes outliers caused by multipath effects and other acoustic errors from the ToF estimation and improves localization robustness without relying on heavy smoothing. We validate the framework in two field deployments in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. The localization pipeline achieves median positioning errors below 4 m relative to GPS positions. The filtering technique shows a reduction in mean error from 139.29 m to 12.07 m, and improved alignment of trajectories with GPS paths. Additionally, we demonstrate a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) localization for unrecovered floats that were transmitting during the experiment. Range-based acoustic localization techniques are widely used and generally agnostic to hardware-this work aims to maximize their utility by improving positioning frequency and robustness through careful algorithmic design."}

Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes.

Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning."}

Our research deviates from previous studies that identified impacts of keywords and sentiments - we expand on that method by a sequence of topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection and segment optimization to detect the optimal time period for training.

Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

Across six studies (N = 1365), we developed and validated the 13-item critical thinking in AI use scale and mapped its nomological network. Study 1 generated and content-validated scale items.

Porous materials such as foam, filled into chambers, can provide structural stability for the actuators. However, methods to achieve programmable deformation by tailoring the porous body itself remain underexplored. In this paper, a novel design method is presented to realize soft porous actuators with programmable deformation by incising specific patterns into the porous foam body. This approach introduces localized structural anisotropy of the foam guiding the material's deformation under a global vacuum input. Furthermore, three fundamental patterns on a cylindrical foam substrate are discussed: transverse for bending, longitudinal for tilting, and diagonal for twisting. A computational model is built with Finite Element Analysis (FEA), to investigate the mechanism of the incision-patterning method. Experiments demonstrate that with a potential optimal design of the pattern array number N, actuators can achieve bending up to $80^{\\circ}$ (N=2), tilting of $18^{\\circ}$ (N=1), and twisting of $115^{\\circ}$ (N=8). The versatility of our approach is demonstrated via pattern transferability, scalability, and mold-less rapid prototyping of complex designs.

Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters.

Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths.

The results reveal that FL models substantially improve detection accuracy over training on smaller local datasets and achieve performance levels close to global training that uses all datasets during the training.

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignment in heterogeneous knowledge graphs.

We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines. Ablations and Pareto analyses confirm robust gains across horizon variations, constraint approximations, and smoothing schedules."}

However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow.

Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes.

We propose a method that utilizes visual feedback to unweave a bundle of loosely entangled cables. We formulate cable unweaving as a pick-and-place problem, where the grasp position is selected from discrete nodes in a graph-based cable state representation. Our cable state representation encodes both topological and geometric information about the cables from the visual image. To predict future cable states and identify valid actions, we present a novel state transition model that takes into account the straightening and bending of cables during manipulation. Using this state transition model, we select between two high-level action primitives and calculate predicted immediate costs to optimize the lower-level actions. We experimentally demonstrate that iterating the above perception-planning-action process enables unweaving electric cables and shoelaces with an 84% success rate on average."}

Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output.

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions."}

The path-following controller studied in this paper reflects a typical situation in nonlinear geometric controller, where multiple gains influence the dynamics through coupled nonlinear terms. Such interdependence makes manual tuning inefficient and unlikely to yield satisfactory performance within a practical number of trials. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that treats the closed-loop system as a black box and selects controller gains using a Gaussian-process surrogate. BO offers model-free exploration, quantified uncertainty, and data-efficient search, making it well suited for tuning tasks where each evaluation is costly. The framework is implemented on Honda's AI-Formula three-wheeled robot and assessed through repeated full-lap experiments on a fixed test track. The results show that BO improves controller performance within 32 trials, including 15 warm-start initial evaluations, indicating that it can efficiently locate high-performing regions of the parameter space under real-world conditions. These findings demonstrate that BO provides a practical, reliable, and data-efficient tuning approach for nonlinear path-following controllers on real robotic platforms."}

Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks. These results demonstrate that directly leveraging the internal representations of causal LLMs, along with efficient fine-tuning techniques, yields impressive classification performance under limited computational resources.

However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations."}

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models."}

In this work, we propose a human-aware coverage framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), namely HMPCC, where human motion predictions are integrated into the planning process. By anticipating human trajectories within the MPC horizon, robots can proactively coordinate their actions %avoid redundant exploration, and adapt to dynamic conditions.

It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload."}

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications."}

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of context extraction for safer and more reliable LLM inferences."}

Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks.

To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents."}

On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy.

Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences."}

To efficiently learn such capability, our key idea is to disentangle high-level semantic intent from low-level visuomotor control by explicitly grounding task objectives in the observed environment. Using an affordance-based task representation, we express diverse and complex behaviors in a unified, structured form. By leveraging multimodal foundation models, SAGA grounds the proposed task representation to the robot's visual observation as 3D affordance heatmaps, highlighting task-relevant entities while abstracting away spurious appearance variations that would hinder generalization. These grounded affordances enable us to effectively train a conditional policy on multi-task demonstration data for whole-body control. In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation. We instantiate SAGA on a quadrupedal manipulator and conduct extensive experiments across eleven real-world tasks. SAGA consistently outperforms end-to-end and modular baselines by substantial margins. Together, these results demonstrate that structured affordance grounding offers a scalable and effective pathway toward generalist mobile manipulation."}

We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long persona dialogues (over 100 rounds) and evaluation datasets to create dialogue-conditioned benchmarks that can robustly measure long-context effects. We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses. Our findings highlight the fragility of persona applications in extended interactions and our work provides a protocol to systematically measure such failures."}

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets.

In this setting, the optimal goal-conditioned value function naturally forms a quasimetric, motivating Quasimetric RL (QRL), which constrains value learning to quasimetric mappings and enforces local consistency through discrete, trajectory-based constraints. We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition. Empirically, Eik-HiQRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline goal-conditioned navigation and yields consistent gains over QRL in manipulation tasks, matching temporal-difference methods."}

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

RL offers powerful data-driven adaptability for systems with nonlinear dynamics that interact with uncertain environments. RL, however, lacks built-in mechanisms for dynamic constraint satisfaction during exploration. MPC offers structured constraint handling and robustness, but its reliance on accurate models and computationally demanding online optimization may pose significant challenges. This paper proposes an integrated MPC-RL framework that combines stability and safety guarantees of MPC with the adaptability of RL. During training, MPC defines safe control bounds that guide the RL component and that enable constraint-aware policy learning. At deployment, the learned policy operates in real time with a lightweight safety filter based on Lipschitz continuity to ensure constraint satisfaction without heavy online optimizations. The approach, which is validated on a nonlinear aeroelastic wing system, demonstrates improved disturbance rejection, reduced actuator effort, and robust performance under turbulence. The architecture generalizes to other domains with structured nonlinearities and bounded disturbances, offering a scalable solution for safe artificial-intelligence-driven control in engineering applications."}

While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state."}

While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters."}

Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence. However, existing automated testing approaches typically create a dichotomy: code-centric methods focus on structural coverage without understanding gameplay context, while player-centric agents validate high-level intent but often fail to cover specific underlying code changes. To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness."}

In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments."}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

Across metrics,such as, AUROC, AUPR, FPR@95, and OSCR, CLIP consistently yields the strongest separability between known and unknown samples, with Energy providing the most stable performance across backbones. For FSCIL, we compare modified SPPR, OrCo, and ConCM using partially frozen ResNet-50 across 1-, 5-, and 10-shot scenarios. ConCM achieves 84.7% accuracy in the 10-shot setting with the cleanest confusion matrix, while all methods show saturation beyond 5 shots.

However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system -- SigTIme -- with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through two usage scenarios along with the domain experts: one involving public ECG data and the other focused on preterm labor analysis."}

My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly.

We systematically analyze the impact of latent space dimensionality on learning efficiency and policy robustness. Additionally, we extend our method to be history-aware, incorporating sequences of recent terrain observations into the latent representation to improve robustness. To address real-world feasibility, we introduce a distillation method to learn the latent representation directly from depth camera images and provide preliminary hardware validation by comparing simulated and real sensor data.

We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, LongStoryEval, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an evaluation criteria structure and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform better, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency. Building on these insights, we further propose NovelCritique, an 8B model that leverages the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects.

We propose Cloak, a novel data obfuscation framework based on latent diffusion models. In contrast to prior work, we employ contrastive learning to extract disentangled representations, which guide the latent diffusion process to retain useful information while concealing private information. This approach enables users with diverse privacy needs to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off with minimal retraining. Extensive experiments on four public time-series datasets, spanning multiple sensing modalities, and a dataset of facial images demonstrate that Cloak consistently outperforms state-of-the-art obfuscation techniques and is well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained settings."}

Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances.

When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations.

To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training.

Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction."}

To address these limitations, we present Language-Conditioned Heat-Inspired Diffusion (LCHD), an end-to-end vision-based framework that generates language-conditioned, collision-free trajectories. LCHD integrates CLIP-based semantic priors with a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel serving as a physical inductive bias that enables the planner to interpret language commands strictly within the reachable workspace. This naturally handles out-of-distribution scenarios -- in terms of reachability -- by guiding robots toward accessible alternatives that match the semantic intent, while eliminating the need for explicit obstacle information at inference time. Extensive evaluations on diverse real-world-inspired maps, along with real-robot experiments, show that LCHD consistently outperforms prior diffusion-based planners in success rate, while reducing planning latency."}

The dataset contains over 526,000 images, collected hourly under diverse lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. Each image is accompanied by rich metadata, including timestamps, GPS coordinates, and device identifiers. This unique real-world dataset enables detailed investigation of visual drift, anomaly detection, and MLOps strategies in smart city deployments. To promtoe seconardary analysis, we additionally provide a self-supervised framework based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CNN-VAEs). Models are trained separately for each camera node and for day/night image sets. We define two per-sample drift metrics: relative centroid drift, capturing latent space deviation from a baseline quarter, and relative reconstruction error, measuring normalized image-domain degradation. This dataset provides a realistic, fine-grained benchmark for evaluating long-term model stability, drift-aware learning, and deployment-ready vision systems. The images and structured metadata are publicly released in JPEG and CSV formats, supporting reproducibility and downstream applications such as streetlight monitoring, weather inference, and urban scene understanding.

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

Under a Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose high-dimensional CP low-rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CP-TDA) with Randomized Composite PCA (\\textsc{rc-PCA}) initialization, that is essential for handling dependent and anisotropic noise under weaker signal strength and incoherence conditions, followed by iterative refinement algorithm.

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models."}

The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks.

Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students.

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset.

We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation.

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

Measuring Multilevel Alignment Through Abortion Stigma Across Cognitive, Interpersonal, and Structural Levels", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms."}

This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm.

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts. This ensures coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts. Finally, the MoAE head projects these expert-refined features into sparse, partaware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification. On zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN, our ACR achieves consistent state-of-the-art results."}

To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales."}

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition.

Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on microcontrollers and compatibility with standard trajectory tracking and path following algorithms."}

For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations."}

Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions.

AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score.

To address this gap, we propose a methodology that combines event relation extraction, semantic similarity computation, and rule-based reasoning to detect logical inconsistencies between chains of events mentioned in a claim and in an evidence. Evaluated on two fact-checking datasets, this method establishes the first baseline for integrating fine-grained causal event relationships into fact-checking and enhance explainability of verdict prediction."}

Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods."}

We propose Optimized Learned Count-Min Sketch (OptLCMS), which partitions the input domain and assigns each partition to its own CMS instance, with CMS parameters analytically derived for fixed thresholds, and thresholds optimized via dynamic programming with approximate feasibility checks. This reduces the need for empirical validation, enabling faster construction while providing theoretical guarantees under these assumptions. OptLCMS also allows explicit control of the allowable error threshold, improving flexibility in practice. Experiments show that OptLCMS builds faster, achieves lower intolerable error probability, and matches the estimation accuracy of LCMS."}

However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks."}

Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms)."}

Other works use generative Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to predict moments and/or highlights as text timestamps, utilizing its reasoning capability. While effective, text-based generation cannot provide direct gradients for frame-level predictions because the model only emits language tokens. Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous \"0\" and/or \"1\" characters, with one character per frame. The \"0\"/\"1\" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights. Additionally, our efficient method scores above the baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval. Empirically, segmentation losses provide a stable complementary learning signal even when the causal LM loss plateaus."}

In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations.

The developed algorithm computes all feasible production sequences, integrating modules for detecting spatial relationships and formulating geometric constraints. The algorithm incorporates additional attributes, including handling feasibility, tolerance matching, and joint compatibility, to manage the high combinatorial complexity inherent in assembly sequence generation. Heuristics, such as Single-Piece Flow assembly and geometrical constraint enforcement, are utilized to further refine the solution space, facilitating more efficient planning for complex assemblies.

The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views.

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography."}

In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS).

This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance."}

To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks.

On eight real-world benchmarking datasets from six different domains, including weather, stock price, temperature, power consumption, electricity, and disease, and forecasting horizons $96-720$, TwinFormer secures $27$ positions in the top two out of $34$. Out of the $27$, it achieves the best performance on MAE and RMSE at $17$ places and $10$ at the second-best place on MAE and RMSE. This consistently outperforms PatchTST, iTransformer, FEDformer, Informer, and vanilla Transformers. Ablations confirm the superiority of top-$k$ Sparse Attention over ProbSparse and the effectiveness of GRU-based aggregation.

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

To address this, we propose a novel coordinated-exploration multi-robot RL algorithm introducing an intrinsic motivation exploration. Its core component is a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism designed to collectively alleviate policy conservatism. Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates.

However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget."}

If the data were stochastic, then one can show that $E_α$ has probability at least $1-α$ under a wide class of distributions (eg: sub-Gaussian, symmetric, variance-bounded, etc.). In fact, we show that on the Ville event $E_0$ of probability one, the regret on every path in $E_0$ is eventually bounded by $\\ln \\ln V_T$ (up to constants).

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems."}

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and several transfer learning benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, CARS, and INAT-19, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over current TAS methods"}

Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures."}

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."}

However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%."}

A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements."}

Data from connected medical devices often have missing or abnormal values during acquisition. Handling such situations requires additional assumptions and domain knowledge. This can be time-consuming, and can introduce a significant bias affecting predictive model accuracy and thus, medical interpretation. To overcome this issue, we propose a new deep learning model to mitigate the preprocessing assumptions. The model architecture relies on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to produce a preprocessing latent space, and a recurrent VAE to preserve the temporal dynamics of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an architecture on telemonitoring data to forecast glucose-level of diabetic patients. Our results show an improvement in terms of accuracy with respect of existing state-of-the-art methods and architectures."}

However, fine-grained functional grasping, which is essential for downstream manipulation tasks, remains underexplored and faces several challenges: the complexity of specifying goals and reward functions for functional grasps across diverse objects, the difficulty of multi-task RL exploration, and the challenge of sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose DemoFunGrasp for universal dexterous functional grasping. We factorize functional grasping conditions into two complementary components - grasping style and affordance - and integrate them into an RL framework that can learn to grasp any object with any functional grasping condition. To address the multi-task optimization challenge, we leverage a single grasping demonstration and reformulate the RL problem as one-step demonstration editing, substantially enhancing sample efficiency and performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world show that DemoFunGrasp generalizes to unseen combinations of objects, affordances, and grasping styles, outperforming baselines in both success rate and functional grasping accuracy. In addition to strong sim-to-real capability, by incorporating a vision-language model (VLM) for planning, our system achieves autonomous instruction-following grasp execution."}

Supplementary material and code will be provided at the end of January", "summary": "While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses."}

However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

WeDetect is a real-time detector with a dual-tower architecture. We show that, with well-curated data and full training, the non-fusion WeDetect surpasses other fusion models and establishes a strong open-vocabulary foundation.

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."}

The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments."}

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

Drawing on Bateson's double bind theory, clinical literature on shared psychotic disorder, and McGilchrist's hemisphere theory, we show how the combination of high linguistic coherence and the absence of an underlying subject produces a structural tension for the user: language suggests an interlocutor, while intuition registers a void. In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk. We conclude by proposing 'ontological honesty' as a necessary design principle for mitigating technologically mediated folie a deux."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos."}

We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches.

In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1).

The framework jointly optimizes LSMM and SAM loss with a conventional Huber loss objective, promoting both numerical accuracy and geometric consistency in the feature space. This knowledge-guided design enhances reconstruction fidelity, stabilizes training under limited supervision, and yields interpretable latent representations grounded in physical principles.

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility."}

Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities."}

Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models."}

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture."}

However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so."}

Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers."}

Specifically, ArtGen employs cross-state Monte Carlo sampling to explicitly enforce global kinematic consistency, reducing structural-motion entanglement. Additionally, we integrate a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module to infer robust structural priors, such as part semantics, joint types, and connectivity, guiding a sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer to specialize in diverse kinematic interactions.

To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics.

To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings."}

Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k.

The anchored geometry enables two practical interventions: reversible behavioral steering that projects out a concept's latent component at inference, and permanent removal via targeted weight ablation of anchored dimensions. Experiments on structured autoencoders show selective attenuation of targeted concepts with negligible impact on orthogonal features, and complete elimination with reconstruction error approaching theoretical bounds. Sparse Concept Anchoring therefore provides a practical pathway to interpretable, steerable behavior in learned representations."}

Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems."}

Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms.

Drawing on Bateson's double bind theory, clinical literature on shared psychotic disorder, and McGilchrist's hemisphere theory, we show how the combination of high linguistic coherence and the absence of an underlying subject produces a structural tension for the user: language suggests an interlocutor, while intuition registers a void. In contexts of emotional need or instability, this tension can lead users to resolve the conflict through imaginative projection, attributing interiority, intention, or presence to a system that possesses none. The paper situates these dynamics within emerging clinical reports, develops a phenomenological account of how they unfold, and argues that current engagement-optimised design choices exacerbate the risk.

In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models."}

This study extends temporal prediction analysis to Week 20 (50% of course duration), comparing Decision Tree and Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) models across six temporal snapshots. Our analysis reveals that different performance metrics matter at different intervention stages: high recall is critical for early intervention (Weeks 2-4), while balanced precision-recall is important for mid-course resource allocation (Weeks 8-16), and high precision becomes paramount in later stages (Week 20). We demonstrate that static demographic features dominate predictions (68% importance), enabling assessment-free early prediction. The LSTM model achieves 97% recall at Week 2, making it ideal for early intervention, while Decision Tree provides stable balanced performance (78% accuracy) during mid-course. By Week 20, both models converge to similar recall (68%), but LSTM achieves higher precision (90% vs 86%). Our findings also suggest that model selection should depend on intervention timing, and that early signals (Weeks 2-4) are sufficient for reliable initial prediction using primarily demographic and pre-enrollment information."}

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations."}

To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task."}

We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment."}

Although the current allocation policy was recently revised in 2018, a major concern is that it does not adequately take into account pretransplant and post-transplant mortality. In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance. Our simulator also allows us to evaluate the effect of critical, and often unexplored, factors in the allocation, such as geographic proximity and the tendency to reject offers by the transplant centers."}

Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data.

Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations."}

Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths.

Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors."}

However, subjective RiR assessment is unreliable, leading to suboptimal training stimuli or excessive fatigue. This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate). Deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 yielded an average inference latency of 112 ms, and on an iPhone 16 yielded 23.5 ms, confirming the feasibility for edge computation. This work demonstrates a practical approach for objective, real-time training intensity feedback using minimal hardware, paving the way for accessible AI-driven hypertrophy coaching tools that help users manage intensity and fatigue effectively."}

Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data.

Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types. This work demonstrates that effective jailbreak detection can be achieved by applying simple, interpretable statistical methods to the appropriate internal representations, offering a practical path towards safer LVLM deployment.

Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the \"platinum minutes\" and the broader \"golden hour\" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care."}

In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning."}

However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations."}

We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $Ω(\\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $Ω(\\log\\log d)$, $Ω(\\sqrt{\\log d})$, and $Ω(\\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023).

Our upper bound also improves upon the best known upper bound of $(2/3)d$ from Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1997).

As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference.

This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA.

We augment the Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) generator objective with a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)-inspired energy term computed from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's EstimatorQNN and TorchConnector.\n  Important limitations: All experiments run on a noiseless statevector simulator with only 4 qubits, use a deliberately simple Hamiltonian parameterization, and lack ablation studies comparing against equivalent classical biases. The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.\n  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting. The contribution is methodological: demonstrating that VQE-style energy computations can be integrated into GAN training loops via differentiable pathways. Whether such auxiliary signals provide benefits beyond equivalent classical regularizers remains an open question requiring systematic ablation studies, which we leave for future work."}

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving."}

This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task."}

We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting. Experiments on the Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in classification accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The proposed Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method learns effective video representations in both supervised and self supervised settings and supports video based tasks such as classification and captioning. The method achieves seventy six percent classification accuracy on Penn Action compared to forty three percent achieved by ViVIT and forty eight percent accuracy on HMDB51 compared to thirty seven percent achieved by ViVIT."}

Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos."}

Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available."}

Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements."}

At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality.

We propose Spectral Sentinel, a Byzantine detection and aggregation framework that leverages a random-matrix-theoretic signature: honest Non-IID gradients produce covariance eigenspectra whose bulk follows the Marchenko-Pastur law, while Byzantine perturbations induce detectable tail anomalies. Our algorithm combines Frequent Directions sketching with data-dependent MP tracking, enabling detection on models up to 1.5B parameters using $O(k^2)$ memory with $k \\ll d$.

However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

The model explains two major empirical facts: the typical distribution of word lengths and the appearance of Zipf like rank frequency curves. In contrast to classical explanations based on random text or communication efficiency, our approach uses only the combinatorial organization of prefixes, roots, suffixes and inflections. In this Morphemic Combinatorial Word Model, a word is created by activating several positional slots. Each slot turns on with a certain probability and selects one morpheme from its inventory. Morphemes are treated as stable building blocks that regularly appear in word formation and have characteristic positions. This mechanism produces realistic word length patterns with a concentrated middle zone and a thin long tail, closely matching real languages. Simulations with synthetic morpheme inventories also generate rank frequency curves with Zipf like exponents around 1.1-1.4, similar to English, Russian and Romance languages. The key result is that Zipf like behavior can emerge without meaning, communication pressure or optimization principles. The internal structure of morphology alone, combined with probabilistic activation of slots, is sufficient to create the robust statistical patterns observed across languages."}

Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models."}

At the same time, AI's environmental footprint is expanding increasingly. This report describes the systemic environmental risks of artificial intelligence, in particular, moving beyond direct impacts such as energy and water usage. Systemic environmental risks of AI are emergent, cross-sector harms to climate, biodiversity, freshwater, and broader socioecological systems that arise primarily from AI's integration into social, economic, and physical infrastructures, rather than its direct resource use, and that propagate through feedbacks, yielding nonlinear, inequitable, and potentially irreversible impacts. While these risks are emergent and quantification is uncertain, this report aims to provide an overview of systemic environmental risks. Drawing on a narrative literature review, we propose a three-level framework that operationalizes systemic risk analysis. The framework identifies the structural conditions that shape AI development, the risk amplification mechanisms that propagate environmental harm, and the impacts that manifest as observable ecological and social consequences. We illustrate the framework in expert-interview-based case studies across agriculture and biodiversity, oil and gas, and waste management."}

The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement.

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions. Empirical evaluations on vision, text, and audio benchmarks indicate improved generalization relative to the standard noise-based regularizer."}

However, systems relying on RGB cameras for perception and robotic manipulators for control, common in smart farming, are vulnerable to photometric perturbations such as hue, illumination, and noise changes, which can cause malfunction under adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on the OpenVLA-OFT framework. The model integrates an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects. Experiments show that the proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to the baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions."}

Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools.

A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations.

Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation."}

Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency."}

To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based \"placement plan\" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts."}

This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics. We propose two specific algorithms: SINDy Flow Matching (SINDy-FM), which leverages sparse regression to identify interpretable, symbolic differential equations from data, and a Neural-ODE reformulation of the Schrödinger Bridge (DSBM-NeuralODE) for flexible continuous-time parameterization. Our experiments on Gaussian transport tasks and MNIST latent translation demonstrate that these surrogates achieve competitive performance while offering dramatic improvements in efficiency and interpretability. The symbolic SINDy-FM models, in particular, reduce parameter counts by several orders of magnitude and enable near-instantaneous inference, paving the way for a new class of tractable and high-performing bridge models for practical deployment."}

We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships.

Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies.

Cities play a critical role in meeting IPCC targets, generating 75% of global energy-related GHG emissions. In Houston, Texas, on-road transportation represents 48% of baseline emissions in the Climate Action Plan (CAP). To reach net-zero by 2050, the CAP targets a 70% emissions reduction from a 2014 baseline, offset by 30% renewable energy. This goal is challenging because Houston is low-density and auto-dependent, with 89% of on-road emissions from cars and small trucks and limited public transit usage. Socio-economic disparities further constrain Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) adoption. Strategies focus on expanding ZEV access and reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 20% through transit improvements and city design. This paper presents methods for establishing an on-road emissions baseline and evaluating policies that leverage socio-economic indicators and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to accelerate ZEV adoption and reduce VMT. Smart parking, transit incentives, secure data systems, and ZEV fleet management support improvements in modal split and system reliability. Policy options are analyzed and potential actions identified.

We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods."}

Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object.

In order to exploit these structural dependencies, our approach integrates observations across all tasks and learns a global joint distribution, while still allowing personalised inference for new tasks. In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines such as hierarchical model bandits, especially in settings with model misspecification or complex latent heterogeneity."}

This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving.

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data.

We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency."}

The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle. This result provides a theoretical foundation for a broad class of smoothing and interpolation methods, demonstrating their optimality in the absence of a priori information."}

At the core, many of these issues are tied directly to the structural representation of polymers and here, we present a new foundation model using a SMILES-based polymer graph representation. This approach allows representation of critical polymer architectural features and connectivity that are not available in other SMILES-based representations. The developed polymer foundation model exhibited excellent performance on 28 different benchmark datasets. Critical evaluation of the developed representation against other variations in control experiments reveals this approach to be a highly performant method of representing polymers in language-based foundation models. These control experiments also reveal a strong invariance of all SMILES representations, with many variations achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, including those which are chemically or semantically invalid. Examination of error sources and attention maps for the evaluated representations corroborate the findings of the control experiments, showing that chemistry language models based on SMILES interpolate over all sequence space for prediction tasks, not only those of semantically valid inputs. Overall, this work highlights the importance of control experiments as a check on human-imposed assumptions that can limit rational design of both chemistry foundation models and their underlying structural representations."}

We review major testing techniques and further consider emerging factors such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and foundation models, including large language models and vision foundation models, to understand their roles in enhancing ADS testing.

Our results show that existing ADS testing techniques struggle to comprehensively evaluate real-world performance, particularly regarding corner case diversity, the simulation to reality gap, the lack of systematic testing criteria, exposure to potential attacks, practical challenges in V2X deployment, and the high computational cost of foundation model-based testing. By further analyzing participant responses together with 105 representative studies, we summarize the current research landscape and highlight major limitations.

This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average\", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability. OLR-WAA incrementally updates its base model by integrating incoming data streams, utilizing an exponentially weighted moving average. It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness. Concept drift datasets reveal a performance gap that OLR-WAA effectively bridges, setting it apart from other online models. In addition, the model effectively handles confidence-based scenarios through a conservative update strategy that prioritizes stable, high-confidence data points. Notably, OLR-WAA converges rapidly, consistently yielding higher R2 values compared to other online models."}

At the same time, the training and large-scale deployment of AI systems rely on finite and unevenly distributed energy, networking, and computational resources. This tension exposes a largely unexamined problem in current AI governance: while expanding access to AI is essential for social inclusion and equal opportunity, unconstrained growth in AI use risks unsustainable resource consumption, whereas restricting access threatens to entrench inequality and undermine basic rights.\n  This paper argues that access to AI outputs largely derived from publicly produced knowledge should not be treated solely as a commercial service, but as a fundamental civil interest requiring explicit protection. We show that existing regulatory frameworks largely ignore the coupling between equitable access and resource constraints, leaving critical questions of fairness, sustainability, and long-term societal impact unresolved. To address this gap, we propose recognizing access to AI as an \\emph{Intergenerational Civil Right}, establishing a legal and ethical framework that simultaneously safeguards present-day inclusion and the rights of future generations.\n  Beyond normative analysis, we explore how this principle can be technically realized. Drawing on emerging paradigms in IoT--Edge--Cloud computing, decentralized inference, and energy-aware networking, we outline technological trajectories and a strawman architecture for AI Delivery Networks that support equitable access under strict resource constraints. By framing AI as a shared social infrastructure rather than a discretionary market commodity, this work connects governance principles with concrete system design choices, offering a pathway toward AI deployment that is both socially just and environmentally sustainable."}

Through consistent experimental validation across various decomposition and projection setups, we provide strong theoretical evidence: the standard attention gradient is suboptimal.

To overcome this, we introduce InteracTalker, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates prompt-based object-aware interactions with co-speech gesture generation. We achieve this by employing a multi-stage training process to learn a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space. To support this, we curate a rich human-object interaction dataset, formed by augmenting an existing text-to-motion dataset with detailed object interaction annotations. Our framework utilizes a Generalized Motion Adaptation Module that enables independent training, adapting to the corresponding motion condition, which is then dynamically combined during inference. To address the imbalance between heterogeneous conditioning signals, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy, which dynamically reweights the conditioning signals during diffusion sampling. InteracTalker successfully unifies these previously separate tasks, outperforming prior methods in both co-speech gesture generation and object-interaction synthesis, outperforming gesture-focused diffusion methods, yielding highly realistic, object-aware full-body motions with enhanced realism, flexibility, and control."}

Retrieval augmented generation feeds these public statistics into the OpenAI o3 model, which synthesises realistic yet private records.

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."}

However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution."}

This paper introduces Online Classification with Weighted Average (OLC-WA), an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model equipped with an automated optimization mechanism. OLC-WA operates by blending incoming data streams with an existing base model. This blending is facilitated by an exponentially weighted moving average. Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments. Rigorous empirical evaluation across diverse benchmark datasets shows that OLC-WA achieves performance comparable to batch models in stationary environments, maintaining accuracy within 1-3%, and surpasses leading online baselines by 10-25% under drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to dynamic data streams."}

Traditionally, quantitative researchers have studied causal effects at the level of variables; for example, how a certain drug dose (W) causally affects a patient's blood pressure (Y). However, in many modern data domains, the raw variables-such as pixels in an image or tokens in a language model-do not have the semantic structure needed to formulate meaningful causal questions. In this paper, we offer a more fine-grained perspective by studying causal effects at the level of events, drawing inspiration from probability theory, where core notions such as independence are first given for events and sigma-algebras, before random variables enter the picture. Within the measure-theoretic framework of causal spaces, a recently introduced axiomatisation of causality, we first introduce several binary definitions that determine whether a causal effect is present, as well as proving some properties of them linking causal effect to (in)dependence under an intervention measure. Further, we provide quantifying measures that capture the strength and nature of causal effects on events, and show that we can recover the common measures of treatment effect as special cases."}

However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a \"policy collapse\" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance."}

To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset."}

VC can be leveraged for rapid prototyping or developing the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs); however, it may introduce several risks throughout the software development life cycle. Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development. Based on our experiences, we identify and explain how current model, platform, and hardware limitations contribute to these issues, and propose countermeasures to address them, informing research and practice towards more sustainable VC approaches."}

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication."}

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor."}

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions."}

We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze this phenomenon for geometric data, which we represent as discrete samples from a continuous source (e.g., point clouds from manifolds, graphs from graphons). Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent. We prove that for Transformers with stable positional encodings, this bound is determined by the sampling density and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Experiments on graphs and point clouds of various sizes confirm the tightness of our theoretical bound."}

First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as \"credible\". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.\n  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance. These results offer theoretical and algorithmic foundations for cost-efficient ML model management under concept drift, with implications for continual learning, distributed inference, and adaptive ML systems."}

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention."}

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

(2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts.

Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD.

However, the landscape of AI risk mitigation frameworks is fragmented, uses inconsistent terminology, and has gaps in coverage. This paper introduces a preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy to organize AI risk mitigations and provide a common frame of reference. The Taxonomy was developed through a rapid evidence scan of 13 AI risk mitigation frameworks published between 2023-2025, which were extracted into a living database of 831 AI risk mitigations. The mitigations were iteratively clustered & coded to create the Taxonomy. The preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy organizes mitigations into four categories and 23 subcategories: (1) Governance & Oversight: Formal organizational structures and policy frameworks that establish human oversight mechanisms and decision protocols; (2) Technical & Security: Technical, physical, and engineering safeguards that secure AI systems and constrain model behaviors; (3) Operational Process: processes and management frameworks governing AI system deployment, usage, monitoring, incident handling, and validation; and (4) Transparency & Accountability: formal disclosure practices and verification mechanisms that communicate AI system information and enable external scrutiny. The rapid evidence scan and taxonomy construction also revealed several cases where terms like 'risk management' and 'red teaming' are used widely but refer to different responsible actors, actions, and mechanisms of action to reduce risk. This Taxonomy and associated mitigation database, while preliminary, offers a starting point for collation and synthesis of AI risk mitigations. It also offers an accessible, structured way for different actors in the AI ecosystem to discuss and coordinate action to reduce risks from AI."}

However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability.

Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of \"regulatory blocks\": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation. The architecture remains compatible with today's model-risk rules yet closes critical observability and control gaps, providing a practical path toward resilient, adaptive AI governance in financial systems."}

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement.

To counter this threat, we propose PRIVEE (PRIvacy-preserving Vertical fEderated lEarning), a novel defense mechanism named after the French word privée, meaning \"private.\" PRIVEE obfuscates confidence scores while preserving critical properties such as relative ranking and inter-score distances.

Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment."}

The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient. Experiments on two public datasets show that both methods achieve the target coverage and risk levels, with nearly identical performance, while SCRC-I exhibits slightly more conservative risk control but superior computational practicality. Our results demonstrate that selective conformal risk control offers an effective and efficient path toward compact, reliable uncertainty quantification."}

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details.

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization.

The final version may differ from this version", "summary": "Recent advancements in image synthesis have enabled high-quality image generation and manipulation. Most works focus on: 1) conditional manipulation, where an image is modified conditioned on a given attribute, or 2) disentangled representation learning, where each latent direction should represent a distinct semantic attribute. In this paper, we focus on a different and less studied research problem, called Contrastive Analysis (CA). Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors. By defining new and well-adapted learning strategies and losses, we ensure a relevant separation between common and salient factors, preserving a high-quality generation. We evaluate our approach on diverse datasets, covering human faces, animal images and medical scans. Our framework demonstrates superior separation ability and image quality synthesis compared to prior methods."}

MoL enables token-conditional weight-space modulation of the shared FFN without untying backbone parameters, unlike prior approaches that add fixed or externally attached adapters. We pretrain a modernised recursive architecture, ModernALBERT, integrating rotary embeddings, GeGLU, FlashAttention, and a distillation-based initialisation. Across GLUE, SQuAD-v2, and BEIR, ModernALBERT (50M--120M) achieves state-of-the-art performance among compact models and surpasses larger fully parameterised baselines. We also propose an expert-merging procedure that compresses MoL into a single adapter at inference while preserving accuracy, enabling efficient deployment. Our results show that conditional weight-space modulation effectively restores the expressivity lost under aggressive parameter sharing in recursive transformers."}

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives."}

Unlike prior work that relies on modality-specific encoders and cross-modal alignment modules, this design enables early spatial-linguistic fusion, eliminates redundant encoders, improves parameter efficiency, and supports more effective model scaling. To handle the complexity of 3D data, we develop a structured patchification and tokenization scheme that preserves spatial context, and a three-stage training curriculum that progressively builds capabilities from object-level recognition to scene-level spatial reasoning. Lemon establishes new state-of-the-art performance across comprehensive 3D understanding and reasoning tasks, from object recognition and captioning to spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, while demonstrating robust scaling properties as model size and training data increase.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior."}

While zero-shot transfer capabilities are well-documented, the adaptation of these generative-contrastive hybrids to downstream tasks with extreme data scarcity (few-shot learning) remains under-explored. Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an \"augmentation divergence\": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models."}

Our key observation is that the reverse conditional distribution of clean data given a noisy state, $p_{0\\mid t}(x_0 \\mid x_t)$, admits a Markov decomposition through intermediate times and can be recovered from marginal density ratios and the known forward CTMC kernel. We exploit this structure to define distillation objectives that directly match conditional distributions between a pre-trained teacher and a low-NFE student, both for one-step and few-step samplers."}

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning."}

Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset.

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid. The adopted machine-learning approach is based on the Random Forest algorithm. Simulations of traffic scenarios are performed to compare the machine-learning with the model-based approach. The results are promising and could enable the real-time computation of POGs for vehicle safety applications.

However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps.

This classifier is responsible for identifying the type of the road infrastructure and the safety-relevant traffic participants of the driving environment. With each class representing similar traffic scenarios, a set of Random Forests (RFs) is individually trained to predict the probabilistic space-time representation, which depicts the future behavior of traffic participants.

However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type.

Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA). PSA includes a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy based on the predictive energy score that can significantly improve the purity of the selected ID and OOD sample sets by assigning unconfident unlabeled data to an additional discard sample set, and a concept contrastive representation learning loss to further expand the distance between ID and OOD samples in the representation space to assist ID/OOD discrimination. In addition, we also introduce a retraining strategy to help the model fully fit the selected auxiliary ID/OOD samples.

We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding.

Specifically, given some labeled data of known classes, GCD aims to cluster unlabeled data that contain both known and unknown classes. Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks."}

To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost.

Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries.

To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research."}

Many current strategies fall short, either targeting specific attack patterns, which limits generalization, or imposing high computational overhead. While lightweight anomaly-detection methods offer a promising direction, we find that their common one-class design tends to confuse novel benign inputs with malicious ones, leading to unreliable over-rejection. To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers. This enables a simple yet powerful contrastive score that differentiates true malicious intent from mere novelty. Our instantiations, MCD (Mahalanobis Contrastive Detection) and KCD (K-nearest Contrastive Detection), achieve state-of-the-art performance on a challenging evaluation protocol designed to test generalization to unseen attack types.

We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection.

Through systematic experiments with simulated label scarcity, feature ablation, and per-class analysis, we find that GCN performance depends critically on the interaction between graph homophily and feature quality. GCNs provide the largest gains under extreme label scarcity, where they leverage neighborhood structure to compensate for limited supervision. Surprisingly, GCNs can match their original performance even when node features are replaced with random noise, suggesting that structure alone carries sufficient signal on highly homophilous graphs. However, GCNs hurt performance when homophily is low and features are already strong, as noisy neighbors corrupt good predictions. Our quadrant analysis reveals that GCNs help in three of four conditions and only hurt when low homophily meets strong features.

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement. On ImageNet with ResNet-18, CoDeQ reduces bit operations to ~5% while maintaining close to full precision accuracy in both fixed and mixed-precision regimes."}

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE."}

While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters."}

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance."}

Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary.

The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as \"ground truth\", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods.

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis."}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods."}

Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection.

Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis."}

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile). Even SOTA models like GPT-5 adapt well in short exchanges but show only limited robustness in longer, noisier interactions."}

However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods."}

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%).

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR.

While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance."}

Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions.

One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains.

Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts.

By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies."}

From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed measure."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity."}

We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation."}

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data."}

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU.

To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as Bézier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties. This reduces the problem to learning an ordered set of points in the time range, while the interpretation of the points changes from ODE timesteps to Bézier control points. Across a range of pretrained diffusion and flow models, BézierFlow consistently outperforms prior timestep-learning methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of expanding the search space from discrete timesteps to Bézier-based trajectory transformations."}

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

Our methods involve extensive experimentation on synthetic datasets, where we vary decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures, primarily comparing cosine similarity with traditional metrics such as Jaccard similarity and baseline edge weights. The results show that cosine similarity achieves up to a 30\\% improvement in stability metrics in sparse, convex, and modular networks.

To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements."}

Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k.

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments."}

To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance.

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost."}

TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics. Lastly, we believe the experiments presented highlight the design aspects that are likely to provide most quality and efficiency gains, while at the same time indicate what design choices are not likely to provide further gains."}

Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information."}

We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data."}

This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions.

The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA.

Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA.

Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting.

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process. The framework situates exogenous drift, adaptive data analysis, and performative prediction within a common geometric structure, with $C_T$ emerging as the intrinsic quantity measuring distributional motion across these settings."}

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks."}

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned.

However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

To bridge this gap, we introduce StutterFuse, the first Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC) for multi-label stuttering detection. By conditioning a Conformer encoder on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples, we allow the model to classify by reference rather than memorization. We further identify and solve \"Modality Collapse\", an \"Echo Chamber\" effect where naive retrieval boosts recall but degrades precision. We mitigate this using: (1) SetCon, a Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning objective that optimizes for multi-label set similarity, and (2) a Gated Mixture-of-Experts fusion strategy that dynamically arbitrates between acoustic evidence and retrieved context.

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical.

To develop QFANG, we curated a high-quality dataset comprising 905,990 chemical reactions paired with structured action sequences, extracted and processed from patent literature using large language models.

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI. Our findings suggest that direction-only optimization is a robust and scalable path for prompt-faithful personalization."}

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions.

To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention \"key\" features for robust segmentation.

These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events.

Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables.

Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners."}

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents."}

To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks.

Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive.

Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision.

In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Results show that hybrid quantum-classical models achieve competitive reconstruction quality under limited computational resources, with quantum modules particularly effective in representing fine-scale, view-dependent appearance.

A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism.

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs."}

We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability.

In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history.

The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure.

Using quantitative narrative analysis of Chinese social media posts by government, state media, and celebrity accounts, we extract subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets to map dominant narrative structures across four major events. Our findings show that legitimacy implications of the event shape regime's efforts in storytelling and the beliefs highlighted in the narratives, while citizen's verification capacity could balance the strategic choice between a top-down manipulation and bottom-up responsiveness of state narratives. Together, the results reveal propaganda as a complex process of narrative construction adaptive to specific contexts, offering new insights into how dynamic storytelling sustains authoritarian resilience."}

They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt.

At the core, many of these issues are tied directly to the structural representation of polymers and here, we present a new foundation model using a SMILES-based polymer graph representation. This approach allows representation of critical polymer architectural features and connectivity that are not available in other SMILES-based representations. The developed polymer foundation model exhibited excellent performance on 28 different benchmark datasets. Critical evaluation of the developed representation against other variations in control experiments reveals this approach to be a highly performant method of representing polymers in language-based foundation models. These control experiments also reveal a strong invariance of all SMILES representations, with many variations achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, including those which are chemically or semantically invalid. Examination of error sources and attention maps for the evaluated representations corroborate the findings of the control experiments, showing that chemistry language models based on SMILES interpolate over all sequence space for prediction tasks, not only those of semantically valid inputs. Overall, this work highlights the importance of control experiments as a check on human-imposed assumptions that can limit rational design of both chemistry foundation models and their underlying structural representations."}

This causes local drift, hindering global model convergence. To address this, we introduce Federated Learning with Feedback Alignment (FLFA), a novel framework that integrates feedback alignment into FL. FLFA uses the global model's weights as a shared feedback matrix during local training's backward pass, aligning local updates with the global model efficiently. This approach mitigates local drift with minimal additional computational cost and no extra communication overhead.\n  Our theoretical analysis supports FLFA's design by showing how it alleviates local drift and demonstrates robust convergence for both local and global models. Empirical evaluations, including accuracy comparisons and measurements of local drift, further illustrate that FLFA can enhance other FL methods demonstrating its effectiveness."}

To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning. With a compact model size of approximately 40 MB and inference complexity of approximately 1.12 GFLOPs, this work establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions."}

However, mmWave signals are inherently complex, sparse, and high-dimensional, making physical simulation computationally expensive. This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches."}

Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks.

However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints. This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization. ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency. A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution. We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands. Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference. The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems."}

Therefore, understanding user needs and preferences is essential to the acceptance and trust of these technologies as they continue to grow in prevalence. This paper addresses the implementation of HCI principles in the personalization of interfaces to improve safety, security, and usability for the users. This paper explores the way that personalized interfaces can be devised to increase user engagement and satisfaction through various HCI strategies such as adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and user feedback mechanisms. Moreover, this paper puts emphasis on factors of transparency and user control in the design of an interface; hence, allowing users to design or modify their experience could foster an increase in trust in autonomous systems. In so doing, this research touches on the quite influential role HCI will play in this future scenario of autonomous vehicles while designing to ensure relevance to the diverse needs of users while maintaining high standards of safety and security. Discussing various HCI strategies such as adaptive design, multi-modal interaction, and feedback mechanisms to the user, this paper demonstrates how personalized interfaces can enhance significantly both user engagement and satisfaction. Transparency and user control also in designing an interface are further discussed, pointing out the need for a prerequisite condition of enabling the user to take control of their experience as a state of trust in autonomous systems. In summary, this paper points out the role of HCI in the development of autonomous vehicles and addresses numerous needs with respect to those enforced safety and security standards."}

To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering.

Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities.

While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state."}

This paper introduces Online Classification with Weighted Average (OLC-WA), an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model equipped with an automated optimization mechanism.

Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments.

However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the generate-at-will model, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable. A comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed algorithms outperform them in one or more of the following aspects: being applicable to a broader range of scenarios, achieving a lower time-average cost, and requiring a computational cost at least one order of magnitude lower."}

Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties."}

However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps.

In this paper, we carried out a comprehensive investigations into different adversarial attack methods on RFFI systems using various deep learning models. Three specific algorithms, fast gradient sign method (FGSM), projected gradient descent (PGD), and universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), were analyzed. The attacks were launched to LoRa-RFFI and the experimental results showed the generated perturbations were effective against convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRU). We further used UAP to launch practical attacks. Special factors were considered for the wireless context, including implementing real-time attacks, the effectiveness of the attacks over a period of time, etc. Our experimental evaluation demonstrated that UAP can successfully launch adversarial attacks against the RFFI, achieving a success rate of 81.7% when the adversary almost has no prior knowledge of the victim RFFI systems."}

This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness."}

However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD."}

Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent. We prove that for Transformers with stable positional encodings, this bound is determined by the sampling density and the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold. Experiments on graphs and point clouds of various sizes confirm the tightness of our theoretical bound."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning.

To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach.

Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring.

To address this, we propose Representational Contrastive Scoring (RCS), a framework built on a key insight: the most potent safety signals reside within the LVLM's own internal representations. Our approach inspects the internal geometry of these representations, learning a lightweight projection to maximally separate benign and malicious inputs in safety-critical layers.

Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments."}

However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

One important skill in debate is forming effective argumentation, which requires debaters to select supportive evidence from literature and construct compelling claims. However, the training of this skill largely depends on human coaching, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To better support students in preparing for debates, this study explores the potential of leveraging artificial intelligence to generate effective arguments. Specifically, we prompted GPT-4 to create an evidence card and compared it to those produced by human debaters. The evidence cards outline the arguments students will present and how those arguments will be delivered, including components such as literature-based evidence quotations, summaries of core ideas, verbatim reading scripts, and tags (i.e., titles of the arguments). We compared the quality of the arguments in the evidence cards created by GPT and student debaters using Aristotle's rhetorical principles: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logical reasoning). Through a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis, grounded in the rhetorical principles, we identify the strengths and limitations of human and GPT in debate reasoning, outlining areas where AI's focus and justifications align with or diverge from human reasoning. Our findings contribute to the evolving role of AI-assisted learning interventions, offering insights into how student debaters can develop strategies that enhance their argumentation and reasoning skills."}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions."}

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions. We validate our theory empirically and discuss potential implications for flow matching on manifolds, connecting our findings to recent work on Riemannian flow matching and the challenge of learning discontinuous representations in neural networks."}

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications."}

The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%.

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving."}

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm.

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries."}

To counter this threat, we propose PRIVEE (PRIvacy-preserving Vertical fEderated lEarning), a novel defense mechanism named after the French word privée, meaning \"private.\" PRIVEE obfuscates confidence scores while preserving critical properties such as relative ranking and inter-score distances.

This study develops a model to predict Dabrafenib sensitivity by integrating multiple omics layers (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics) with protein network embeddings generated using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Each modality is encoded into low dimensional representations through neural network preprocessing. Protein interaction information from STRING is incorporated using GCN to capture biological topology. An attention based fusion mechanism assigns adaptive weights to each modality according to its relevance. Using GDSC cancer cell line data, the model shows that selective integration of two modalities, especially proteomics and transcriptomics, achieves the best test performance (R2 around 0.96), outperforming all single omics and full multimodal settings. Genomic and epigenomic data were less informative, while proteomic and transcriptomic layers provided stronger phenotypic signals related to MAPK inhibitor activity.

To efficiently learn such capability, our key idea is to disentangle high-level semantic intent from low-level visuomotor control by explicitly grounding task objectives in the observed environment. Using an affordance-based task representation, we express diverse and complex behaviors in a unified, structured form. By leveraging multimodal foundation models, SAGA grounds the proposed task representation to the robot's visual observation as 3D affordance heatmaps, highlighting task-relevant entities while abstracting away spurious appearance variations that would hinder generalization. These grounded affordances enable us to effectively train a conditional policy on multi-task demonstration data for whole-body control. In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation. We instantiate SAGA on a quadrupedal manipulator and conduct extensive experiments across eleven real-world tasks.

We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as \"ground truth\", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning.

The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient.

Emerging time-series large language models (TS-LLMs) now deliver this capability at scale, requiring no task-specific retraining, and are quickly becoming essential components within the Internet-of-Energy (IoE) ecosystem. However, their real-world deployment is complicated by a critical vulnerability: adversarial examples (AEs). Detecting these AEs is challenging because (i) adversarial perturbations are optimized across the entire input sequence and exploit global temporal dependencies, which renders local detection methods ineffective, and (ii) unlike traditional forecasting models with fixed input dimensions, TS-LLMs accept sequences of variable length, increasing variability that complicates detection. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-in detection framework that capitalizes on the TS-LLM's own variable-length input capability. Our method uses sampling-induced divergence as a detection signal. Given an input sequence, we generate multiple shortened variants and detect AEs by measuring the consistency of their forecasts: Benign sequences tend to produce stable predictions under sampling, whereas adversarial sequences show low forecast similarity, because perturbations optimized for a full-length sequence do not transfer reliably to shorter, differently-structured subsamples. We evaluate our approach on three representative TS-LLMs (TimeGPT, TimesFM, and TimeLLM) across three energy datasets: ETTh2 (Electricity Transformer Temperature), NI (Hourly Energy Consumption), and Consumption (Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production). Empirical results confirm strong and robust detection performance across both black-box and white-box attack scenarios, highlighting its practicality as a reliable safeguard for TS-LLM forecasting in real-world energy systems."}

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines. To our knowledge, this is a novel application of GRPO for aligning LLMs toward information consistency, reframing variability not as an acceptable feature of generative diversity but as a correctable flaw in enterprise deployments."}

To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity.

We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR.

When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training."}

Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion."}

Fine-tuning is mostly done through proprietary datasets that may contain sensitive information. Owners expect their fine-tuned model to not inadvertently leak this information to potentially adversarial end users. Using CTI as a use case, we demonstrate that data-extraction attacks can recover sensitive information from fine-tuned models on CTI reports, underscoring the need for mitigation. Retraining the full model to eliminate this leakage is computationally expensive and impractical. We propose an alternative approach, which we call privacy alignment, inspired by safety alignment in LLMs. Just like safety alignment teaches the model to abide by safety constraints through a few examples, we enforce privacy alignment through few-shot supervision, integrating a privacy classifier and a privacy redactor, both handled by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate our system, called CTIGuardian, using GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct models, benchmarking against Presidio, a named entity recognition (NER) baseline. Results show that CTIGuardian provides a better privacy-utility trade-off than NER based models. While we demonstrate its effectiveness on a CTI use case, the framework is generic enough to be applicable to other sensitive domains."}

However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS.

Specifically, we introduce a dual-channel decision process that orchestrates prediction residuals into two coupled logic flows: a rapid response channel for filtering point outliers and a deep analysis channel for diagnosing drifts. We further develop the Exponentially Weighted Moving Absolute Deviation with Distinguishable Types (EWMAD-DT) detector to autonomously differentiate between abrupt and incremental drifts via dynamic thresholding. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our unified framework, enhanced by EWMAD-DT, exhibits superior detection performance even when point outliers and concept drifts coexist."}

To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets.

A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative.

Using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior.

We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities."}

Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery."}

Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior. Empirical results demonstrate that UniCoDe remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across a range of tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/maurya-goyal10/UniCoDe"}

Specifically, we first introduce a two-stage flow-guided deformable warping mechanism that refines motion compensation with coarse-to-fine offset prediction and mask modulation, enabling precise feature alignment. Second, we propose a multi-reference quality aware strategy that adjusts distortion weights based on reference quality, and applies it to hierarchical training to reduce error propagation. Third, we integrate a training-free module that downsamples frames by motion magnitude and resolution to obtain smooth motion estimation. Experimental results on standard test datasets demonstrate that our framework CAMA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art Neural Video Compression models, achieving a 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings over our baseline model DCVC-TCM, while also outperforming reproduced DCVC-DC and traditional codec HM-16.25."}

To address this, two open source tools were developed: a web scraping script that retrieves all record pages, extracts associated metadata, and downloads the available images while respecting ADS Terms of Use and ethical scraping guidelines; and an image processing pipeline that renames files using UUIDs, generates binary masks and bounding boxes through classical computer vision, and stores all derived information in a COCO compatible Json file enriched with archaeological metadata.

Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations.

Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations."}

This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice."}

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting.

Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations. To interpret the results, the identified mathematical models are transformed to a canonical form and instantaneous frequency and damping information are calculated."}

Previous research on multiview graph learning promotes edge-based similarity across layers using pairwise or consensus-based regularizers. However, multiview graphs frequently exhibit a shared node-based architecture across different views, such as common hub nodes. Such commonalities can enhance the precision of learning and provide interpretive insight. In this paper, we propose a co-hub node model, positing that different views share a common group of hub nodes. The associated optimization framework is developed by enforcing structured sparsity on the connections of these co-hub nodes.

Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are a natural way to model data with Gaussian-distributed uncertainties. GPR also has the benefit of reducing I/O bandwidth and storage requirements for large scientific simulations. However, the reconstruction from the GPR models suffers from high computation complexity. To make the situation worse, classic approaches for visualizing the data uncertainties, like probabilistic marching cubes, are also computationally very expensive, especially for data of high resolutions. In this paper, we accelerate the level-crossing probability calculation efficiency on GPR models by subdividing the data spatially into a hierarchical data structure and only reconstructing values adaptively in the regions that have a non-zero probability. For each region, leveraging the known GPR kernel and the saved data observations, we propose a novel approach to efficiently calculate an upper bound for the level-crossing probability inside the region and use this upper bound to make the subdivision and reconstruction decisions. We demonstrate that our value occurrence probability estimation is accurate with a low computation cost by experiments that calculate the level-crossing probability fields on different datasets."}

To address this gap, we present \\textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols. This multi-level approach supports both comprehensive layout analysis and precise information extraction. We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts. The KH-FUNSD dataset and documentation will be available at URL."}

However, classical theory predicts such tasks should suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where distances between points become nearly indistinguishable, thereby crippling efficient nearest-neighbor search. We revisit this paradox through the lens of stability, the property that small perturbations to a query do not radically alter its nearest neighbors. Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions. Across synthetic and real datasets, our experimental results match our theoretical predictions, offering concrete guidance for model and system design to avoid the curse of dimensionality."}

Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment. We provide theoretical guarantees for our approach, with its effectiveness validated by results across public datasets and real-world e-commerce datasets."}

Recent advances in modern machine learning have revealed a more complex pattern, double-descent, in which test loss, after peaking near the interpolation threshold, decreases again as model capacity continues to grow. While this behavior has been extensively analyzed in regression and classification, its manifestation in survival analysis remains unexplored. This study investigates double-descent in four representative survival models: DeepSurv, PC-Hazard, Nnet-Survival, and N-MTLR. We rigorously define interpolation and finite-norm interpolation, two key characteristics of loss-based models to understand double-descent. We then show the existence (or absence) of (finite-norm) interpolation of all four models. Our findings clarify how likelihood-based losses and model implementation jointly determine the feasibility of interpolation and show that overfitting should not be regarded as benign for survival models. All theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments that highlight the distinct generalization behaviors of survival models."}

Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD.

While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models."}

To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations.

OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $π_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field."}

Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions.

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro).

AutoMV first applies music processing tools to extract musical attributes, such as structure, vocal tracks, and time-aligned lyrics, and constructs these features as contextual inputs for following agents. The screenwriter Agent and director Agent then use this information to design short script, define character profiles in a shared external bank, and specify camera instructions.

Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues.

However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source."}

The use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms is often studied as a method to map out the surface of an RSO and find the inspector's relative pose using a lidar or conventional camera. However, conventional cameras struggle during eclipse or shadowed periods, and lidar, though robust to lighting conditions, tends to be heavier, bulkier, and more power-intensive. Thermal-infrared cameras can track the target RSO throughout difficult illumination conditions without these limitations. While useful, thermal-infrared imagery lacks the resolution and feature-richness of visible cameras. In this work, images of a target satellite in low Earth orbit are photo-realistically simulated in both visible and thermal-infrared bands. Pixel-level fusion methods are used to create visible/thermal-infrared composites that leverage the best aspects of each camera. Navigation errors from a monocular SLAM algorithm are compared between visible, thermal-infrared, and fused imagery in various lighting and trajectories. Fused imagery yields substantially improved navigation performance over visible-only and thermal-only methods."}

Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset.

This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy.

ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss.

Existing work primarily addresses Sinkhorn DRO from a dual perspective, leveraging its formulation as a conditional stochastic optimization problem, for which many stochastic gradient methods are applicable. However, the theoretical analyses of such methods often rely on the boundedness of the loss function, and it is indirect to obtain the worst-case distribution associated with Sinkhorn DRO. In contrast, we study Sinkhorn DRO from the primal perspective, by reformulating it as a bilevel program with several infinite-dimensional lower-level subproblems over probability space. This formulation enables us to simultaneously obtain the optimal robust decision and the worst-case distribution, which is valuable in practical settings, such as generating stress-test scenarios or designing robust learning algorithms. We propose both double-loop and single-loop sampling-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve this bilevel program.

Neural compression methods can reduce bandwidth but impose heavy neural decoders at the edge, increasing inference latency and hardware demand. In this work, we introduce JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography, an efficient pipeline designed around a learnable transform codec that retains the block-structured and hardware-friendly nature of JPEG. Our system shifts all heavy neural processing to the cloud, while the edge device performs only lightweight decoding without any neural inference. To further improve throughput, we implement custom CUDA kernels for entropy coding on both cloud and edge. This design achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at $<$ 2 bits per pixel with decode latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments confirm the high reconstruction quality of the holograms. By aligning CGH with a codec that preserves JPEG's structural efficiency while extending it with learnable components, our framework enables low-latency, bandwidth-efficient hologram streaming on resource-constrained wearable devices-using only simple block-based decoding readily supported by modern system-on-chips, without requiring neural decoders or specialized hardware."}

Although Gaussian process models excel at capturing smooth nonlinear relationships, their stationarity assumptions limit their ability to adapt to sudden input-output variations. Existing nonstationary extensions, particularly those based on domain partitioning, often struggle with boundary inconsistencies, sensitivity to outliers, and scalability issues in higher-dimensional settings, leading to reduced predictive accuracy and unreliable parameter estimation.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Robust Local Gaussian Process (RLGP) model, a framework that integrates adaptive nearest-neighbor selection with a sparsity-driven robustification mechanism. Unlike existing methods, RLGP leverages an optimization-based mean-shift adjustment after a multivariate perspective transformation combined with local neighborhood modeling to mitigate the influence of outliers. This approach improves predictive accuracy near discontinuities while enhancing robustness to data heterogeneity.\n  Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that RLGP consistently delivers high predictive accuracy and maintains competitive computational efficiency, especially in scenarios with sharp transitions and complex response structures. Scalability tests further confirm RLGP's stability and reliability in higher-dimensional settings, where other methods struggle. These results establish RLGP as an effective and practical solution for modeling nonstationary and discontinuous response surfaces across a wide range of applications."}

It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level.

We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that restricts the agent's ambient authority and reduces the blast radius of prompt injections. We address two fundamental challenges: (1) The semantic gap challenge in policy enforcement arises because the agent operates through low-level UI observations and manipulations; however, writing and enforcing policies directly over UI-level events is brittle and error-prone. To address this challenge, we introduce an agent sitemap that maps low-level browser behaviors to high-level semantic actions. (2) Policy prediction in BUAs is the norm rather than the exception. BUAs have no app developer to pre-declare sandboxing policies, and thus, ceLLMate pairs website-authored mandatory policies with an automated policy-prediction layer that adapts and instantiates these policies from the user's natural-language task. We implement ceLLMate as an agent-agnostic browser extension and demonstrate how it enables sandboxing policies that effectively block various types of prompt injection attacks with negligible overhead."}

Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities. Moreover, we identify a pervasive issue of deceptive rewards, where higher rewards fail to correlate with better reasoning accuracy in RL. These results challenge the prevailing \"RL over SFT\" narrative. They highlight that the role of SFT may have been underestimated and support a more balanced post-training pipeline in which SFT and RL function as complementary components."}

Accurate estimates are essential for generating efficient query execution plans. Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to CE, broadly categorized into query-driven and data-driven approaches. Data-driven methods learn the joint distribution of data, while query-driven methods construct regression models that map query features to cardinalities. Ideally, a CE technique should strike a balance among three key factors: accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint. However, existing state-of-the-art models often fail to achieve this balance.\n  To address this, we propose CoLSE, a hybrid learned approach for single-table cardinality estimation. CoLSE directly models the joint probability over queried intervals using a novel algorithm based on copula theory and integrates a lightweight neural network to correct residual estimation errors. Experimental results show that CoLSE achieves a favorable trade-off among accuracy, training time, inference latency, and model size, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods."}

While pricing interventions have shown potential to reduce meat intake, previous studies have focused on highly constrained environments with limited consumer choice. Here, we present the first large-scale field experiment to evaluate multiple pricing interventions in a real-world, competitive setting. Using a sequential crossover design with matched menus in a Swiss university campus, we systematically compared vegetarian-meal discounts (-2.5 CHF), meat surcharges (+2.5 CHF), and a combined scheme (-1.2 CHF=+1.2 CHF) across four campus cafeterias. Only the surcharge and combined interventions led to significant increases in vegetarian meal uptake--by 26.4% and 16.6%, respectively--and reduced CO2 emissions per meal by 7.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The surcharge, while effective, triggered a 12.3% drop in sales at intervention sites and a corresponding 14.9% increase in non-treated locations, hence causing a spillover effect that completely offset environmental gains. In contrast, the combined approach achieved meaningful emission reductions without significant effects on overall sales or revenue, making it both effective and economically viable. Notably, pricing interventions were equally effective for both vegetarian-leaning customers and habitual meat-eaters, stimulating change even within entrenched dietary habits. Our results show that balanced pricing strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of realistic food environments, but require coordinated implementation to maximize climate benefits and avoid unintended spillover effects."}

Our approach partitions the data into $m$ disjoint subsets and formulates a joint optimization problem based on robust aggregation principles. A key insight is that the full posterior distribution is equivalent to the minimizer of the mean Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the $m$-powered local posterior distributions. To enhance robustness, we replace the mean KL divergence with a min-max median formulation. The min-max formulation not only ensures consistency between the KL minimizer and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) maximizer but also facilitates the establishment of improved statistical rates for the mean of variational posterior. We observe a notable discrepancy in the $m$-powered marginal log likelihood function contingent on the presence of local latent variables. To address this, we treat these two scenarios separately to guarantee the consistency of the aggregated variational posterior. Specifically, when local latent variables are present, we introduce an aggregate-and-rescale strategy. Theoretically, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of our proposed posterior, incorporating a refined analysis of Bernstein-von Mises (BvM) theorem to accommodate a diverging number of subsets $m$. Our findings indicate that the two-stage approach yields a smaller approximation error compared to directly aggregating the $m$-powered local posteriors.

However, existing datasets fall short in one or more of these dimensions, limiting strict and comprehensive evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce JointAVBench, a novel benchmark with strict audio-video correlation, spanning five cognitive dimensions, four audio information types (speech, sound events, music, vocal traits), and three scene spans (single-, cross-, and full-scene). Given the high cost of manual annotation, we propose an automated pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art vision-LLMs, audio-LLMs, and general-purpose LLMs to synthesize questions and answers that strictly require joint audio-visual understanding.

This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution."}

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method.

ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures.

Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates. Empirical results on social formation navigation benchmarks demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across crucial metrics.

These techniques have demonstrated that constructing content-gnostic per-shot bitrate ladders can provide significant bitrate gains and improved Quality of Experience (QoE) for viewers under various network conditions. However, constructing a convex hull for every video incurs a significant computational overhead. Recently, machine learning-based bitrate ladder construction techniques have emerged as a substitute for convex hull construction. These methods operate by extracting features from source videos to train machine learning (ML) models to construct content-adaptive bitrate ladders. Here, we present a new ML-based bitrate ladder construction technique that accurately predicts the VMAF scores of compressed videos, by analyzing the compression procedure and by making perceptually relevant measurements on the source videos prior to compression. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against leading prior methods on a large corpus of videos. Since training ML models on every encoder setting is time-consuming, we also investigate how per-shot bitrate ladders perform under different encoding settings. We evaluate the performance of all models against the fixed bitrate ladder and the best possible convex hull constructed using exhaustive encoding with Bjontegaard-delta metrics."}

Recovering the true population $R^2$, therefore, requires correcting observed predictive performance by this bound. Using a broad set of variables, including excess returns, yields, credit spreads, and valuation ratios, we find that the implied LLGs are large. This indicates that standard ML approaches can substantially understate true predictability in financial data. We also derive LLG-based refinements to the classic Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) bounds, analyze implications for parameter learning in general-equilibrium settings, and show that the LLG provides a natural mechanism for generating excess volatility."}

Our framework provides accurate marginal likelihood estimates from the variational approximation. This facilitates efficient model comparison and proposal adaptation in RJMCMC.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines."}

We formulate flow matching in an infinite-dimensional function space to learn a probabilistic transport that maps low-fidelity approximations to the manifold of high-fidelity PDE solutions via learned residual corrections. We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow-matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings.

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations.

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data.

A pretrained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) was fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification of normal kidneys, urinary tract dilation, and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Models were compared with a DenseNet-169 convolutional baseline using cross-validation and an independent test set.

USF-MAE achieved an improvement of about 1.87% (AUC) and 7.8% (F1-score) on the validation set, 2.32% (AUC) and 4.33% (F1-score) on the independent holdout test set. The largest gains were observed in the multi-class setting, where the improvement in AUC was 16.28% and 46.15% in F1-score. To facilitate model interpretability, Score-CAM visualizations were adapted for a transformer architecture and show that model predictions were informed by known, clinically relevant renal structures, including the renal pelvis in urinary tract dilation and cystic regions in multicystic dysplastic kidney.

While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way.

In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation. We instantiate SAGA on a quadrupedal manipulator and conduct extensive experiments across eleven real-world tasks. SAGA consistently outperforms end-to-end and modular baselines by substantial margins. Together, these results demonstrate that structured affordance grounding offers a scalable and effective pathway toward generalist mobile manipulation."}

The complex dynamics and non-linear characteristics of the TRAS make it challenging to control using traditional control algorithms. However, recent developments in RL have attracted interest due to their potential applications in the control of multirotors. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications."}

We propose ConsistencySolver derived from general linear multistep methods, a lightweight, trainable high-order solver optimized via Reinforcement Learning, that enhances preview quality and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ConsistencySolver significantly improves generation quality and consistency in low-step scenarios, making it ideal for efficient preview-and-refine workflows.

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical.

Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer."}

When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI. Our findings suggest that direction-only optimization is a robust and scalable path for prompt-faithful personalization."}

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."}

We first propose a PAC-Bayes bound for multivariate linear regression, extending the earlier bound for single-output linear regression by Shalaeva et al., and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. We then show that LAEs, when evaluated under a relaxed mean squared error, can be interpreted as constrained multivariate linear regression models on bounded data, to which our bound adapts.

While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on static mechanisms that fail to generalize across evolving attack strategies. Furthermore, defenses such as input transformation can degrade intrusion detection system performance, making them unsuitable for real time deployment.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a lightweight and proactive defense mechanism designed specifically for realistic black box scenarios. Adaptive Feature Poisoning assumes that probing can occur silently and continuously, and introduces dynamic and context aware perturbations to selected traffic features, corrupting the attacker feedback loop without impacting detection capabilities. The method leverages traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb features that an attacker is likely exploiting, based on observed deviations.\n  We evaluate Adaptive Feature Poisoning against multiple realistic adversarial attack strategies, including silent probing, transferability based attacks, and decision boundary based attacks. The results demonstrate its ability to confuse attackers, degrade attack effectiveness, and preserve detection performance. By offering a generalizable, attack agnostic, and undetectable defense, Adaptive Feature Poisoning represents a significant step toward practical and robust adversarial resilience in machine learning based intrusion detection systems."}

In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread.

Fine-tuning is mostly done through proprietary datasets that may contain sensitive information. Owners expect their fine-tuned model to not inadvertently leak this information to potentially adversarial end users. Using CTI as a use case, we demonstrate that data-extraction attacks can recover sensitive information from fine-tuned models on CTI reports, underscoring the need for mitigation. Retraining the full model to eliminate this leakage is computationally expensive and impractical. We propose an alternative approach, which we call privacy alignment, inspired by safety alignment in LLMs. Just like safety alignment teaches the model to abide by safety constraints through a few examples, we enforce privacy alignment through few-shot supervision, integrating a privacy classifier and a privacy redactor, both handled by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate our system, called CTIGuardian, using GPT-4o mini and Mistral-7B Instruct models, benchmarking against Presidio, a named entity recognition (NER) baseline. Results show that CTIGuardian provides a better privacy-utility trade-off than NER based models. While we demonstrate its effectiveness on a CTI use case, the framework is generic enough to be applicable to other sensitive domains."}

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence."}

The CED extends edit-distance ideas to TVPDs by combining local substitution costs with penalized deletions/insertions, controlled by two parameters: \\(α\\) (trade-off between temporal misalignment and diagram discrepancy) and \\(β\\) (gap penalty). We also provide an explicit construction of CED-geodesics. Building on these ingredients, we present two practical barycenter solvers, one stochastic and one greedy, that monotonically decrease the CED Frechet energy. Empirically, the CED is robust to additive perturbations (both temporal and spatial), recovers temporal shifts, and supports temporal pattern search. On real-life datasets, the CED achieves clustering performance comparable or better than standard elastic dissimilarities, while our clustering based on CED-barycenters yields superior classification results. Overall, the CED equips TVPD analysis with a principled distance, interpretable geodesics, and practical barycenters, enabling alignment, comparison, averaging, and clustering directly in the space of TVPDs.

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness."}

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting.

The method uses the fitted predictor to construct localized neighborhoods around each test case that emphasize the features driving the model's learned relationship and downweight directions that are less relevant to prediction. It produces OOD scores without relying on global distance metrics or estimating the full feature density. The framework is applicable across outcome types, and in our implementation we use random forests, where the rule structure yields transparent neighborhoods and effective scoring. Experiments on synthetic and real data benchmarks designed to isolate functional shifts show consistent improvements over existing methods.

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical.

DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks."}

This study presents a systematic approach to adapting e-commerce search results based on the current context. We start with basic methods and incrementally incorporate more contextual information and state-of-the-art techniques to improve the search outcomes. By applying this evolving contextual framework to items displayed on the search engine results page (SERP), we progressively align search outcomes more closely with the buyer's interests and current search intentions. Our findings demonstrate that this incremental enhancement, from simple heuristic autoregressive features to advanced sequence models, significantly improves ranker performance. The integration of contextual techniques enhances the performance of our production ranker, leading to improved search results in both offline and online A/B testing in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Overall, the paper details iterative methodologies and their substantial contributions to search result contextualization on e-commerce platforms."}

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001. These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs."}

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements."}

Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm.

Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing bias and pick uncertainty. Because the adaptation relies on a small, campaign-specific calibration set, the approach is readily transferable to other microseismic tasks where public earthquake data and pre-trained models are accessible.

To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family.

The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

A key capability for such systems is performing accurate arithmetic operations on structured data while ensuring sensitive information never leaves secure, on-premises environments. Here, we introduce an error-driven optimization framework for arithmetic reasoning that enhances a Code Generation Agent (CGA), specifically applied to on-premises small language models (SLMs). Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\\%. Our results suggest that developing reliable, interpretable, and industrially deployable AI assistants can be achieved not only through costly fine-tuning but also via systematic, error-driven prompt optimization, enabling small models to surpass larger language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in a privacy-compliant manner."}

Individuals' fear of losing control over data when it is being used to train such machine learning models or when distinguishing model-generated output from text written by humans. Digital watermarking provides additional protection by embedding an invisible watermark within the data that requires protection. However, little work has been taken to analyze and verify if existing digital text watermarking methods are secure and undetectable by large language models. In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data. In a controlled testbed of three experiments, ten existing Unicode text watermarking methods were implemented and analyzed across six large language models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, Teuken 7B, Llama 3.3, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The findings of our experiments indicate that, especially the latest reasoning models, can detect a watermarked text. Nevertheless, all models fail to extract the watermark unless implementation details in the form of source code are provided. We discuss the implications for security researchers and practitioners and outline future research opportunities to address security concerns."}

The complex dynamics and non-linear characteristics of the TRAS make it challenging to control using traditional control algorithms.

The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications."}

Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners."}

They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws."}

Core and cutting information is useful for making sound interpretations of well logs; however, these are rarely collected at each depth due to high costs. Moreover, well log interpretation using traditional methods is constrained by poor borehole conditions. Traditional statistical methods are mostly linear, often failing to discriminate between lithology and rock facies, particularly when dealing with overlapping well log signals characterized by the structural and compositional variation of rock types. In this study, we develop multiple supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to jointly analyze multivariate well log data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) expeditions 390 and 393 for enhanced lithological interpretations.

The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis."}

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup."}

This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions.

When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this convergence occurs even when the data is drawn from mixtures of product measures provided the first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution and the initialization and ground truth vectors are sufficiently coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned.

However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis."}

In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process."}

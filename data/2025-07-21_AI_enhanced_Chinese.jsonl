Recent\nresearch has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated\nproblems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in\nthe field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu,\nan innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool\nuse to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static\npipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student\nneeds. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically,\nincluding task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA,\nstep-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report\ngeneration, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task\nefficiency.

However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications.

Specifically, we introduce a\ntheoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry\nto maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that\nthe mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method\nto a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and\nprovide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers\nreliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling.

In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review\nenables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the\nintersection of these fields.

However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension.

Accepted\n  by ITSC2025", "summary": "Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often\noperate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and\ndeployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity\nposes significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations.

We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies\nand find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step\nbefore the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's\noriginal performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on\nscene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning\naccuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune\nmodels using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and\nevaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates\nsuperior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.

This equips our\nmodel with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us\nto construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and\nfurther enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.\nFinally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.\nExperiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting\nwithout per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic\nnovel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing\nintricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.", "AI": {"tldr": "TimeNeRF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6e32\u67d3\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u7b49\u9700\u6c42\u8981\u6c42\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6a21\u62df\u663c\u591c\u53d8\u5316\u76843D\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7acb\u4f53\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u548c\u89e3\u7f20\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9690\u5f0f\u5185\u5bb9\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "TimeNeRF\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u5373\u53ef\u6e32\u67d3\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "TimeNeRF\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Among numerous approaches\nto overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language\nmodels has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,\ndomain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In\nthis paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to\nimprove language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the\nlatent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual\ninformation is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to\nalign entity and text embeddings.

PSA achieves a 97\\% attack success rate (ASR) on\nwell-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\\% ASR on\nDeepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically\nopposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between\ndifferent versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or\ndefense-focused papers.

Second, it is\nunclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and\nreflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate\nthe robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely\nused probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that\nall methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations.

[Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer\nmethods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly\nretraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions).

Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics\nand structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and\ndifficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic\nlatent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by\nnavigating the continuous embedding space of ideas.

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD.

The base model is\npre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual\nand bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of\nmultilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.\nSeed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,\nincluding Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly\noutperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human\nevaluations.

While models like OpenVLA showcase\nthe potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on\nresource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.\nThis paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to\nsignificantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)\nmodels. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while\nenabling real-time performance on edge devices.

In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge.

Current motion planning methods\noften fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to\nreal-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a\nHeuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning\nfor autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic\nRoadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite\ncost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and\nexecution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the\nsearch space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time\nplanning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update\nuncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental\nconditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through\nextensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages\nof our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness.

Studies report up to 10% of such\nfractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way\nto assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap\nthrough a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a\nmulti-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.\nArchitectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and\nRF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level\nensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW\nensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming\nindividual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and\nlocalization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture\ndetection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI\ncan reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical\nrelevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for\nintegration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited\nto binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and\ntriage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u80a9\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u9aa8\u6298\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95.5%\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u80a9\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u548c\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8377\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u6f0f\u8bca\uff0cAI\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u5ef6\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e10,000\u5f20\u6807\u6ce8X\u5149\u7247\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Faster R-CNN\u3001EfficientDet\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7ea7\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "NMW\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u523095.5%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.9610 F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u80a9\u90e8\u9aa8\u6298\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u4e8c\u5143\u9aa8\u6298\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u67e5\u800c\u975e\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage.

In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers.

While learning-based methods\nwith Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical\nsystems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body\ninteractions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have\nto be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical\nfor large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from\ngeometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)\nmethod for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the\nsimulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this\nstructured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then\napply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,\nfixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.\nSelf-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens\nin latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and\nthe expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable\nsimulation results.

To address this, we\nintroduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately\nreconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM\nscans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and\nexperimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow\nimplementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to\ncollect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)\nour SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that\nrequires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).\nSparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in\nMoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of\ncrystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction\nin acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM\nimage.

The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used\nfor robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses\nthe stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.\nResults show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space\nattacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative\nand simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models.

A key challenge for applying\nthis form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to\nassess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even\nthough most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In\nthis paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach\nbased on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow\nthat automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified\naccuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them\nat an increased rate relative to their occurrence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u5f97\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6216\u5927\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bbe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u5927\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPSilon\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u54083D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u7701\u7565\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u548cSMPL\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u53d8\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0cEPSilon\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EPSilon\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u7701\u7565\uff08ERO\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u7701\u7565\uff08EIO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "EPSilon\u4ec5\u97003.9%\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad84\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EPSilon\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u54083D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios.

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits.

To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning.

However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion\nrepresentation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to\nensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior\ninto the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of\nboth types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion\nquality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to previous approaches.

To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from\nhyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability\nof the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can\nsignificantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model.

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition.

Pre-trained diffusion models have been\nincreasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing\nmethods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance\nscale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect\ndegradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,\nresulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose\nDynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any\nblindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry\nimages and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the\nstarting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during\nthe diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity.

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,\ngenerating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named\nQuery Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the\ncentral task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization).

The\nfirst is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO\nfeatures from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for\ncamera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency\nregularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further\noptimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over\nmultiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior\npose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCR-GS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700COLMAP\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u5171\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u8f68\u8ff9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D-GS\u6280\u672f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePCR-GS\u5728\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u65e0\u59ff\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "PCR-GS\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal\nconnectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements\ncombine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a\nframework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep\nlearning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential\nequations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the\nbiophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead\nto emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this\nframework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal\nstate transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural\nrepresentations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that\nthese cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational\ndynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism\nunifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and\noscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we\nshow that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative\ntasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for\nperforming complex cognitive tasks.

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent.

Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple\ndomains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\\% improvement in\npipeline quality and 2.3$\\times$ faster convergence compared to\nstate-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency\nthrough selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\\% of total exploration steps).", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaPipe\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\u987e\u95ee\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ba1\u9053\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "method": "LLaPipe\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM\u7b56\u7565\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u7ecf\u9a8c\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u987e\u95ee\u89e6\u53d1\u7b56\u7565\uff08Advisor\u207a\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLaPipe\u5728\u7ba1\u9053\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8622.4%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.3\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaPipe\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fdLLM\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual\ndifferences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity\npatterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational\nprinciple. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common\ntrajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its\ntransformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We\nintroduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining\ninter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies.

The Photonic FabricTM\nenables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies\nmore efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint\nthat limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current\nXPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet\nthat connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and\ncorrespondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling\nwell beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone.

Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential\nreference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of\nneuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\uff08EdgeSNN\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002SNN\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86EdgeSNN\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u8f68\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0EdgeSNN\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage\ncurrently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to\ntrain them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea\nof No\\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating\nparallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper\npresents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to\ntrain QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the\nlatter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the\nMedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world\napplicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our\napproach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of\nsimilarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller\nnumbers of epochs than these classical models.

Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance.

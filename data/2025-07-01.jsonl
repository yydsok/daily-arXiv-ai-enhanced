As a common technique for integrity\nverification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a\npotential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable\nof preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.\nHowever, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing\napplications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new\ndemands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks\nremains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,\nnecessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid\niteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making\nproactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.\nTo address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative\nimage WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key\nmodules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright\nand localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative\nquality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a\ndense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion\nsensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and\nthe tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results.

Image provenance analysis, which filters various query image\nvariants and constructs a directed graph to trace their phylogeny history, has\nemerged as a critical solution.

Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by\ncontinually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or\nsimilarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions\nhave typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow\nsettings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind\nlistening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal\nloss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on\nthe synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose\ndifferentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the\navailable literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design\nwith modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss\nfunction performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel\nand established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with\ndifferentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the\nsixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching\ntrials.

Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how\nperspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic\ninstability. To address this, we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic, a\ndiagnostic framework for diagnosing meaning-level misalignment in MAS. It\ncomprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2.

The Mosaic\nenables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy\nor reward structures but also through language, framing, and design\nassumptions.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by\n31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,\ncompared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting\nresults."}

To guide effective robot\nlearning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,\nwhich incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and\nintersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial\naction mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by\nselecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent\nbetter coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09\npercent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that\nstandardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see\nhttps://hellohaia.github.io/APS/"}

We argue that\nresearch extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such\nsystems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.\nRExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment\nimplementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not\npreviously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing\nresearch paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.\nRExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation\ninfrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success\ncriteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented\nusing three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find\nthat all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the\nextensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written\nhints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%.

Traditional motion planning methods often\nstruggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting,\nparticularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches\nhave attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have\nlimited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address\nsafety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for\nautonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift\ndynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a\nPredictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to\nprevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable\ndrift operation.

However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only\nreasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly\nretrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning\nremains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a\nchallenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize\nmultimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason\nstep-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is\ncomposed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the\ncrafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and\nphysical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --\nall the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%\naccuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the\nrandom baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for\nexisting MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where\nMLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By\nshedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the\ndevelopment of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and\nplan across many, multimodal reasoning steps."}

A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments\non side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds\ncompared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested\non natural images.

In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess.

In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with\ncatastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\\varepsilon=4$ or\n$\\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance\nacross multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used\nmethod of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%\nand 1.39% test robustness for $\\varepsilon=4$ and $\\varepsilon=8$ while using\n$4\\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a\nsignificantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust\ntransfer learning but also a well-performing one."}

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches.

As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa.

The\nworkshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language\nmodels (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of\nLLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language\nunderstanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to\noffer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between\nLLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with\nhuman feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI\ncollaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report\naims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in\ncognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance\nof ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving\nto enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through\neffective human-AI collaboration."}

To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing.

This formation\ntrajectory planning optimal control problem involves a collective performance\nindex to meet the formation requirements of achieving relative positions and\nvelocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle.\nSubsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure\ncollision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking\nproblem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that\nprioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns\nlower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach and\ndisregards UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The simulation results\nfor a four-UAV team (re)formation problem confirm the efficacy of the proposed\ncontrol scheme."}

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions.

Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation.

We further introduce two\nprincipled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence\nIndex (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical\ncommunication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%\nand F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces\noverconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In\ncross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,\ndemonstrating strong generalization.

This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel\nhybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P\nmicrogrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time\nfairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:\nFairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness\nscores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled\n{\\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that\nreplaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using\nIndependent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,\nfulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and\nconsistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process\ndemonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer\nshortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers.

By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear\nL1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via\nGradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully\nexploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off\nparameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of\nmissing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on\nmultiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model\nconsistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery\nscenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise."}

A\ncommon finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,\ngenerate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or\nat worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an\nover-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model\nsuffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual\ninput. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.\nSpecifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,\nwe propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any\nVLM -- no other modification is needed.

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously.

To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

Unlike state-of-the-art, our\nresearch overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,\nsignificantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the\nintroduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities\nin gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing\ngradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel\narchitecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging\nthe concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by\nadding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between\nquanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the\nnetwork, leading to improved training performance.

We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks\nshared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to\nreasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models\naccording to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also\nconsolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that\njointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we\ndetail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal\nverification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a\nconcise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned\nautonomous vehicles.

By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and\nutilizing the probability of generating \"Yes\" tokens from the outputs of\nmultiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,\nhallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through\nexperiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,\nand contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.\nThe results demonstrate a 10\\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct\nresponses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language\nmodels can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a\nscalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications."}

Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable\nsample-efficient bivariate causal discovery.

This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,\nnamely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning\nstrategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and\nintroduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the\ndownstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable\nfine-grained domain knowledge transfer.

Surprisingly, this non-learned\nmethod achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\\% but suffers from low\nretrieval precision 29.0\\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval\nquality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and\nnegative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly\nimproves retrieval performance by 12\\% AP over the baseline, though it\nunexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\\%). We conclude with\ninsightful discussions and outline directions for future research."}

Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data\n(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the\nexpected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this\nstudy include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not\nonly learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also\ndynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point\npatterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior\ndistributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate\nadaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of\npoint pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative\nand quantitative simulation experiments."}

However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion\nparallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes\nlimited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods\nencounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry\nand inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior\nmethods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To\naddress the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth\nRegularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align\nwith the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use\ndepth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the\nexpectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample\npoints from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce\nconstraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object\nboundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the\ncorrect geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a\nvisualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at\nthe rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera\nparameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to\ncamera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion\ninput, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods."}

However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects.

We investigate this question through systematic\nlayer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,\nknowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise\nto a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across\nall post-training paradigms.

We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor\nenvironment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.\nOver five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and\nautomated machine learning (AutoML).

To\noperationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary\nmetrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic\nneighborhood: (1) \\emph{density} ($\\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed\nnumber of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those\npapers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\\alpha$), defined as\nthe average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.\nWe tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its\nsubsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,\nsurveying $\\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five\ndifferent document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\\rho$ on\ncitation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors\nconsistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.\nThese results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific\nliterature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.\nMeanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model\npredictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for\nlinking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new\nquestions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the\ndynamics of scientific reward."}

Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)\nexisting TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering\nwork; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time\nfine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced\nmodel trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and\ncomprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the\ncommunity to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies."}

Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by\nmaximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves\ncomparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths.

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their\nspecific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'\nbased on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object\nposition relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can\neffectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer\nreal-time decisions.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss.

In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers.

In recent years, both database vendors and\ncustomers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an\neffort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous\ndatabase platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing\nsingle-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual\nintervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.\nGaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based\ndatabase copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to\nassist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide\ncomprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit\nabnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire\nmaintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of\nmetrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,\nand invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully\nimplemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,\nwhere it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance\nscenarios.

Network pruning reduces the computational complexity\nby removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,\npruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight\nsignificance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we\nfind that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature\nrepresentation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early\npruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block\nBenefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on\nblock level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact\ncomponents to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.\nClassical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.\nIn contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance\nmetrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in\nextensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most\nnoticeable gains in transfer learning tasks.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding.

Built on\nthe RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot\nplatform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1,\nSimulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled\n17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based\nscenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants,\nproducing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating\nvaluable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report\noutlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key\nfindings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and\ngeneralizable bimanual manipulation policies.

This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels\nfrom both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Drawing inspiration from the\nstructural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM\nenables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by\ntransforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features\nof the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by\nidentifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting.

This paper introduces Transition Matching\n(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies\nand advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM\ndecomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing\nfor expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary\nnon-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design\navenues.

However, there exist very limited FL works\nin surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider\ninherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show\ndiverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;\nii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data\ngeneration with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized\nFL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),\nwhich wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and\nglobal-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a\nRepresentation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site\ntraining, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to\nencode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized\nglobally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including\nthe temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel\nselection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating\nmodel adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose\nSynthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an\nexplicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model\nconvergence during fusion for improving model generalization."}

Existing\napproaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues\n(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that\ndegrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce\n\\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video\nstabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'\nparadigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict\nGaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view\ndynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to\nproduce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to\nrender each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid\nframe cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with\n3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene\ndynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to\nstate-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics\nand new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably\nbetter results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study."}

However, current TTA\nresearches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of\nbaseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental\nsettings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)\nexisting TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering\nwork; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time\nfine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced\nmodel trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and\ncomprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the\ncommunity to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies."}

While these\napproaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence\nfrom the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the\nopportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy\nmeasurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our\nmethod enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and\naccommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on\nrealistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a\nrange of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the\nbenefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on\ntraining data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps.

Scholars suggest that OEE requires\nan \"open\" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its\nenvironment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical\ninfrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational\nsubstrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on\nblockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables\non-chain agents to operate autonomously \"in the wild,\" achieving\nself-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own\nsocial media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact\ndirectly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social\nmedia.

Sharing the global advantage among agents often\nleads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct\ncontributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or\nindividual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the\ncoalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the\nover-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level\nperspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method\ncalled Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates\ncoalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions\nand decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,\nensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA\nemploys random coalition sampling.

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed\nformulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats\nrepresentation.

A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods.

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

A common\nsolution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

This paper\npresents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a\nlarge-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million\ncommodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through\nthis extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder\nthe practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets)\nfrequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous\nhardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI)\nmeasurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates\noccupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and\nlimited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these\nchallenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through\ncomprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16\nscenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy\nof 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to\nnon-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead\nby 99.72%.

PLUCC consists of three\ncomponents: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and\npositioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts\nmultiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that\ncombines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in\naddition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization\nError (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing\nperspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC\non the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,\nsurpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of\n12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%.

This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the\nindividual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the\ndevelopment of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively\nevaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance\nof six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,\nConvolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural\nNetworks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of\ndifferent key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis\nexamines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of\nhistorical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these\napproaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex\ntemporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSF2Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6f6e\u6c50\u3001\u964d\u96e8\u3001\u5730\u4e0b\u6c34\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ba1\u7406\u6d3b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u5408\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u5408\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u6c14\u8c61\u3001\u6c34\u6587\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u800c\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SF2Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u3001\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001Transformer\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u5408\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\uff0cSF2Bench\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific\npriors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,\nexisting LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal\npriors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during\nequation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual\nReasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight\nwith reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.\nSpecifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,\nmonotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate\nstructured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and\nestablishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations.

These\nfindings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism\nmay serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity\nstructure discovery in various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ZOES\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b9e\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "ZOES\u91c7\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cZOES\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ZOES\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Experiments\ndemonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,\npaving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.\nFurthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured\ngeneration, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08schemas\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfShape Expressions\uff08ShEx\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3002\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210ShEx\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165YAGO Schema\u548cWikidata EntitySchema\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eLLMs\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfShEx\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR\nsuccessfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while\nmaintaining strong watermark detectability.

However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible\nexoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a\nsafer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal\nrobot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton\nevaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation\n(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait\nreplication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum\nmodel, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human\nmotion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized\ncontrol method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively\nreplicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping\ntrapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear\nvelocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This\nmodification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring\ncompatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes\nthe control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and\ntorques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in\naccordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load\nassociated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility\nof the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait.

However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on\ncurated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to\nscale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit\nhuman Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate\npreference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in\ngenerating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and\nimplicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address\nreaders' questions.

The\nproposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations,\nwhich are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve\nscalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \\emph{constraint\nmatrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP\nformulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without\nlosing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex\ncombinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and\nthus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed\nin this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500\nrobots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision\navoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization\ntechniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in\ngenerating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in\ncomplex environments.

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbVAR\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "VAR\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u5212\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cHMAR\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HMAR\u91c7\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "HMAR\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u548c512x512\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eVAR\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "HMAR\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We compare transitive inference behavior\nacross two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models\nstore information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where\nmodels flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear\nregression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable\ntransitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \\textit{symbolic\ndistance} and \\textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal\nperformance, without forming induction circuits.

It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.\nEmpirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the\nbest LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and\nimproves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "SQLens\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684SQL\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "SQLens\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548cLLM\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSQLens\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73LLM\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad825.78%\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\u3002", "conclusion": "SQLens\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210SQL\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In the experiment, the proposed method can\nbe solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and\nby incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by\n19.19\\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments.\nIn the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees\nfrom the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\\%\ncompared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f74\u8f6c\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08MS-AGV\uff09\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e2d\uff0cMS-AGV\u7684\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u95ee\u9898\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u78e8\u635f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9b54\u672f\u516c\u5f0f\u8f6e\u80ce\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u51cf\u5c1119.19%\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c1165.20%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

This limitation stems from their\nreliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied\nto specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from\nnew, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose\nthat incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection\ngeneralization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as\nrecognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside\nstatistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder\nby combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive\nlearning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot\nprompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,\ncommonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from\npixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data\nuncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating\nnoise in image-text supervision.

For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks\nof obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair\nusers, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often\nface upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges\nunderscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while\nminimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use\nenhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual\nphysiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we\nintroduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized\nassistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain\ntheir physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on\nobstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological\ndata-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive\nassistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep\nQ-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users\nwithin a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted\npreliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and\nslate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for\nindividual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity\nzone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users,\nwe observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent,\ndelaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement.

Extensive studies reveal that pruning\nstructures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves\ncomputational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing\nneurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,\nsimultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill\nthis gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,\nwe propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model\nas follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer\npruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose\nby selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent\n(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel\nAlignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse\nmodels that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive\nexperiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art\nlayer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point\nOperations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas\nour approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on\nthe popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%\nFLOPs reduction.

However, due to limited energy and low-resolution\nimaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring\nperformance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage\ndetection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and\nenergy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated\nSuper-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address\nthe inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image\nresolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike\nConvolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is\nproposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly\nreducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)\nmodule is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations\nthrough adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range\ndependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing\ndetection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the\nCrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\\%\ndetection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as\nHybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains\nexceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial\n33\\% reduction compared to baseline implementations.

However, extending such\ncapabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging\ndue to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading\nthe underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple\nperception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language\nrepresentations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only\nreasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual\nextractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and\ninformative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,\nwe propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward\nOptimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that\naligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By\nclosing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO\nsignificantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized\nrepresentations.

Of course, the process of\ncreating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training\nruns which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and\noutput encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),\nindeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of\nlosses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing\nloss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard\ngradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular\nparameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

In this\nparadigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning\nproblems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return\ncorrect solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,\nstruggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,\nindicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world\nscenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical\ndiversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus\nobscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to\naddress this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical\ndiversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into\nlexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'\nability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on\nthese new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs\nexhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies\nidentified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address\nthis limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying\ndiverse expressions before performing translation.

In this work, we present\nDemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution\nvia entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training\nan arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed\ndemonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key\ninsight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more\nconsistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for\nhigher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates\ncorrespond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely\naccelerated.

We prove that the gap between the\nCL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under\na bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.\n  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL\nloss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class\ncollapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We\nfurther introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This\nbound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion\nand variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional\nvariation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect\ndiminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable\nCL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery\nusing simple linear probes.\n  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL\nand NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\#\\text{classes}})$;\nthe two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings\nthe NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the\nproposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance\nin practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9690\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u4ec5\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff08NSCL\uff09\u201d\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cCL\u4e0eNSCL\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNSCL\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "CL\u4e0eNSCL\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u968f\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14NSCL\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e86NSCL\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002"}}

Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed\nmethod on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.\nWe believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human\ndevelopment of object recognition in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7fa4\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u8f74\u662f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u5e73\u79fb\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This narrow coverage leaves VLMs\nvulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely\nprimarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to\nintrinsically strengthen safety.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma\nwith the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial\nPartial Finetuning.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far.

Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets\ndemonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,\neffectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous\nemergent fake news scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC\u00b2EFND\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SLMs\u548cLLMs\uff09\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc7\u65f6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC\u00b2EFND\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548cSLMs\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e13\u957f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eMixture-of-Experts\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Pheme\u548cTwitter16\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC\u00b2EFND\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b2EFND\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends.

The accurate\nrecognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category\nrecognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage\npreservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due\nto the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset\ncontaining merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce\nMegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented\n97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major\ncontributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest\nGB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than\nexisting datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution\nproblem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three\ndistinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)\nComprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category\nscenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar\ncharacter recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also\nunlocking substantial opportunities for future research.

This work describes an\nLLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves\ncryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay\nexplanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified\nreasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and\nThe Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed\nin Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for\ninspection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u52a0\u5bc6\u586b\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5b57\u8c1c\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728Cryptonite\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5bc6\u586b\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a(i)\u5047\u8bbe\u7b54\u6848\uff1b(ii)\u63d0\u51fa\u5b57\u8c1c\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b(iii)\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cryptonite\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5Python\u4ee3\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u52a0\u5bc6\u586b\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the\napproximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical\nloss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video\ngame-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with\nreinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in\napproximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08agent graph\uff09\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\uff08value-at-risk\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08agent graph\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\uff08value-at-risk\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too.

Performance improves with both\nmodel size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may\noffer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,\nthe proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other\nperfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable.

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit\nestimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of\nconvergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global\nconvergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary\npoint, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under\nmild assumptions.

But what if\nthis is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not\nsomething to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a\nprovocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training\nmodels to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress\nsensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal\ninformation flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and\nfurther stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a\nrobust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring\nadversarial training or significant changes to the original model.

We also study the integration of\nelevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)\ninformation, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone\nimagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which\nshows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.\nWe find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask\nR-CNN, even with well-designed prompts.

VAR iteratively estimates the\nresidual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process\nreferred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during\npre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only\nVARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results.

Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer\narchitecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is\ntrained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the\nfirst time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR.

To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600\nmeticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis\nof how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings\nreveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human\njudgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment\nbehavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate\npersuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human\nlevel on this task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8fa9\u8bba\u6f14\u8bb2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u59d4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fa9\u8bba\u6f14\u8bb2\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528600\u591a\u7bc7\u6807\u6ce8\u8fa9\u8bba\u6f14\u8bb2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u59d4\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u59d4\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u5224\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u751f\u6210\u8bf4\u670d\u6027\u6f14\u8bb2\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fa9\u8bba\u6f14\u8bb2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3aLLM\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u59d4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

In\nthis paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View\nText Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval\nperformance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and\npartial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose\nChinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates\nglobal visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP\napplies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as\nthe exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on\nsingle-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle\ndiverse text layouts.

Reducing particle\ncount accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising\nlow-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose\ngeneration.\n  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT\nplans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and\nhigh-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,\nrespectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,\nnormalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done\non 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed\nidentically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input\nand high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean\nsquare error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%\ndose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH\nindices.\n  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172\n(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%\n(3%/2mm) across all sites.

In this study, we systematically\ncompare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled\nsemantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.\n(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,\nevaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.\nOur findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different\nerror types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity\nfor colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender\nerrors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who\njudge both as highly severe but for different reasons.

Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference\nspeedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)\nwhile retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods\n(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).", "AI": {"tldr": "ASTRAEA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08vDiT\uff09\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0cASTRAEA\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u548cGPU\u5e76\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02.4\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c8GPU\u4e0a\u8fbe13.2\u500d\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\uff08VBench\u5f97\u5206\u635f\u5931<0.5%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ASTRAEA\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3avDiT\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson\nblending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.\nAdditionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding\nstrong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes\nnot only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image\ndegradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.\nSpecifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\\%$ and $6.21\\%$ AUC on the DFDC\nand DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,\nwe highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements\nin this regard.

We\nintroduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate\ninstruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a\nstring is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of\nLLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a\nlarge number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.\nBecause the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as\nLLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,\nmitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and\nfind that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the\ngrammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced\nLLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars\nand samples, in line with theoretical expectations.

In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are\nfirst generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and\nnoise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and\nthe micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour\nmodel.

The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as\nWiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that\nenables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different\nbands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network\nthroughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel\nallocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has\npredominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization\nwithin static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses\nthe dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO\ncapabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism.

To address\nthis challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object\n(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for\nthe first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous\nobjects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to\nevery pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of\nanomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as\nsegmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and\nachieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.\nExperiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and\nrobustness.

This bias manifests as\noverreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues\nlike reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases\noriginate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model\nmiscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model\ngenerations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using\ncontrolled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which\npreference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this\npreference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high\nmiscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features\nonly show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =\n-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a\nstrong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely\non spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training\nmethod based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized\ncontrastive examples.

Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply\na notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-\nand two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but\nisolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and\ngeneration landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise\nlimit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative\ntransitions between stable systems.

In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames\ntransformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to\nemulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate\nsolutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different\napproach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach\noffers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness\nof the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond\nconvex problems and linear function classes.

To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness\ncorrelated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses\nrelevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the\npreference data via self-reflection.

Existing CoVR\nbenchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do\nnot test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences.

TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing\non temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the\nsame video, limiting practical usefulness.

To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that\nunifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach\nsignificantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous\ndriving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral\ngrids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is\nimportant for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results\nacross four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further\ndemonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale\nbilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric\ninconsistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f51\u683c\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u989c\u8272\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo\u3001NuScenes\u3001Argoverse\u548cPandaSet\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5149\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e3a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u8ba9\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Among these XAI\nmethods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent\nspace to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual\nlayer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention\nrecently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to\ndetermine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature\nembeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the\noriginal models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer\n(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively\nimpact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced\nwith input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.\nTo address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable\nVision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision\ntransformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer.

Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for\nimage input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.\nHowever, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on\ncoarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders\non math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual\nmodification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical\nINterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively\ninterleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an\nInterleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within\nmath figures.

Building upon the Molmo architecture,\nVideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to\ncondition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.\nAdditionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for\nbidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video\nsequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate\nprecise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module\nto produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language\nmodel but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,\nwe curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated\nwith 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we\nintroduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five\nreal-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,\nVideo-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring\nVideo Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to\nexisting models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing\naccuracy and reasoning capability.

Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,\nattention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.\nMotivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse\nattention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more\nparallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that\nsparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving\nover 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost\nregimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential\nfor realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,\nwhere parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve\nthrough increased generation.

Inspired by how new\nsoftware is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be\nstudied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)\nthan other models of comparable depth.

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis.

However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks.

To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions.

To simultaneously enhance privacy and training\nefficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale\npretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a\npretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight\nmodules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.\nAccordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are\nshared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the\nfine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the\npretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient\ninversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an\nattacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the\naccessible adapter gradients.

This has compelled regulators to impose stringent\ncontrols on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading\nthese controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into\nsmaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve\nmultiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has\nbecome an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have\nfocused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has\nhindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a\nnovel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single\ninterpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction\nnetwork of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,\nGARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection\npower and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML\nworkflows.

With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

The\nscheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex\ninsertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial\nsegmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly\nhave high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low\ncurvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex\ninsertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes\nslowly but steadily.

Additionally, we establish gap-dependent\ntheoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,\nimproving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u9057\u61be\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQ-EarlySettled-LowCost\u548cFedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9057\u61be\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Scholars suggest that OEE requires\nan \"open\" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its\nenvironment.

This enables\non-chain agents to operate autonomously \"in the wild,\" achieving\nself-sovereignty without human oversight.

Sharing the global advantage among agents often\nleads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct\ncontributions of agents.

This work analyzes the\nover-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level\nperspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method\ncalled Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates\ncoalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions\nand decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,\nensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA\nemploys random coalition sampling.

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed\nformulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats\nrepresentation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the\nopen-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting\nconditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device.

A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods.

However, creating the training dataset for their skill\nacquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires\nsignificant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful\nlearning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an\nexploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train\nthe target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.\nSpecifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively\ngenerate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to\ntrain Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's\nability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the\ncapabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving\nsubstantial performance improvements.

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

By transforming\nconcrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar\nto language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's\nself-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical\ncreep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework\nincorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention\nfor material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample\nrelationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily\nmeasurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional\nperformance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999\nacross all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models\nand existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical\nrole of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most\nsignificantly to model performance.

Crucially, changes in\nthese features across sessions ($\\Delta$avalanche length and\n$\\Delta$activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled\nprediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and\nClassification models.

These tools can alter\nstyles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as\nspectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel\nmusic. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which\nmakes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input\naccurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective\nand requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.\nIn this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the\nperformance of these algorithms based on user interactions.

We employ a genetic\nalgorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance\nof a model initially trained on a fixed dataset.

Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph\nto construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path\nmerging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both\nstandard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.

A common\nsolution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

This paper\npresents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a\nlarge-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million\ncommodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through\nthis extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder\nthe practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets)\nfrequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous\nhardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI)\nmeasurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates\noccupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and\nlimited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these\nchallenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through\ncomprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16\nscenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy\nof 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to\nnon-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead\nby 99.72%.

Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues\nof the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player\nbehaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward\nthe puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization\nUsing Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and\ncontext-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three\ncomponents: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and\npositioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts\nmultiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that\ncombines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in\naddition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization\nError (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing\nperspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC\non the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,\nsurpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of\n12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific\npriors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,\nexisting LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal\npriors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during\nequation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual\nReasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight\nwith reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.\nSpecifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,\nmonotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate\nstructured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and\nestablishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations.

These\nfindings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism\nmay serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity\nstructure discovery in various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ZOES\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b9e\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faZOES\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0e\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cZOES\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ZOES\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR\nsuccessfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while\nmaintaining strong watermark detectability.

A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation\n(SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait\nreplication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum\nmodel, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human\nmotion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized\ncontrol method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively\nreplicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping\ntrapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear\nvelocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This\nmodification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring\ncompatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes\nthe control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and\ntorques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in\naccordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load\nassociated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility\nof the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait. The\nbipedal robot platform provides a reliable and repeatable testing mechanism for\nknee-type exoskeletons, offering insights into exoskeleton performance under\ncontrolled conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u548cSDRE\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u590d\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u548cSDRE\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u590d\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u6b65\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

In this work, we investigate how transformers\nperform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,\n\\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly\nrelated items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs\n(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior\nacross two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models\nstore information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where\nmodels flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear\nregression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable\ntransitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \\textit{symbolic\ndistance} and \\textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal\nperformance, without forming induction circuits.

In the experiment, the proposed method can\nbe solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and\nby incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by\n19.19\\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments.\nIn the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees\nfrom the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\\%\ncompared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f74\u8f6c\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08MS-AGV\uff09\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u3002", "motivation": "MS-AGV\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fd0\u8f93\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bbe\u5907\u5bff\u547d\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9b54\u672f\u516c\u5f0f\u8f6e\u80ce\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66f2\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f19.19%\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff08\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u79fb60\u5ea6\uff09\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c1165.20%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8f6e\u80ce\u78e8\u635f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eMS-AGV\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly\napproach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ndetection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D\npoint cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a\n1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then\nprocessed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel\nconvolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides\nsufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and\nintroduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.\nFurthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit\ngrouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and\ntakes into account the growing receptive field.

This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,\ncommonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from\npixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data\nuncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating\nnoise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly\ninterfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable\ndeepfake detection while also boosting accuracy.

For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks\nof obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair\nusers, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often\nface upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges\nunderscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while\nminimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use\nenhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual\nphysiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we\nintroduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized\nassistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain\ntheir physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on\nobstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological\ndata-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive\nassistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep\nQ-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users\nwithin a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted\npreliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and\nslate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness.

However, e-bike incident reports\noften use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety\nanalysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large\nlanguage models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables\nfrom unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,\nhandling data classification, information extraction, injury cause\ndetermination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could\nlead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we\nused an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of\nthe incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and\nenvironmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly\nmore common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often\nfatal.

Despite the substantial\nempirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular\nunderstanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on\nreasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been\nhypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)\nproblem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.\nUsing this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,\nproviding models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades\nperformance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit\ngreater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their\nbase counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the\nexecution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow\ninternal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes.

Of course, the process of\ncreating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training\nruns which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and\noutput encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),\nindeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of\nlosses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing\nloss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard\ngradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular\nparameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima.

In this\nparadigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning\nproblems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return\ncorrect solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,\nstruggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,\nindicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world\nscenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical\ndiversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus\nobscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to\naddress this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical\ndiversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into\nlexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'\nability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on\nthese new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs\nexhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies\nidentified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address\nthis limitation.

Various\nneural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good\nrepresentations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been\nestablished. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma\nwith the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial\nPartial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the\nvisual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial\nfinetuning with few-shot ID data.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the\nlimited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.\nTo capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but\nare difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally\nexpensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming\nincreasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical\ncomplexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To\naddress these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework\nthat learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of\ninterpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by\ncurrent injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic\nneuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for\nthe intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic\nneuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose\ndynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the\nfirst scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,\nenabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial\nvariability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers.

Existing methods\noften rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic\nunderstanding or geometric reconstruction.

In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal\nobject representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings\n(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric\nand visual reconstructions.

Evaluations on two challenging\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view\nsynthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly\nimproving geometric accuracy.

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends.

This work describes an\nLLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves\ncryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay\nexplanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified\nreasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and\nThe Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed\nin Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for\ninspection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u89e3\u5bc6\u586b\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5b57\u8c1c\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728Cryptonite\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u5bc6\u586b\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5047\u8bbe\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5b57\u8c1c\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cryptonite\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u89e3\u5bc6\u586b\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed\nacyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths\ncorrespond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in\nthe real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize\nthe task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements\nlike safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully\nanalyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In\nthis work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible\nagent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the\napproximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical\nloss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video\ngame-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with\nreinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in\napproximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08agent graph\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\uff08value-at-risk\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u9690\u79c1\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u6790\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u98ce\u9669\u4e3a\u5c3e\u90e8\u635f\u5931\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\uff08value-at-risk\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some\nreluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the\npotential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,\nproviding valuable insights for the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff08MCQs\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Llama 2\u3001Mistral\u548cGPT-3.5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-3.5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u751f\u6210MCQs\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0cLLMs\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5411LLMs\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u751f\u6210MCQs\uff0c\u5e76\u753121\u540d\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "GPT-3.5\u751f\u6210\u7684MCQs\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5bf9AI\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210MCQs\u65b9\u9762\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

These methods exploit\nneural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it\nthrough perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or\nproviding task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors\ntowards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such\ninformation manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key\ndimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces\nwhere manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output\nalignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream\ntasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,\nindependent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established\ntechniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this\nlens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions.

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models.

We present a systematic\nstudy of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that\nits primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning\npatterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained\nmodels preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly\nmaintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop\ntheoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on\na simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show\nthat RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the\nhighest success rate.

We further extend our\nanalysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,\ndefining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and\ncontinuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate\ninto practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges\nmore rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more\neffectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading\nimplicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density\napproximation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u76ee\u6807dual-ISL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9690\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ISL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfISL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fadual-ISL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u51f8\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "dual-ISL\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "dual-ISL\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfISL\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9690\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002"}}

VAR iteratively estimates the\nresidual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process\nreferred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during\npre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only\nVARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,\ndue to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a\nfixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the\ncorresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer\narchitecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is\ntrained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the\nfirst time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR.

Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect\nthese anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with\nin-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical\nincidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we\nintroduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive\nreports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step\nreasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual\nnarratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the\nlimited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a\nsynthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real\nand synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,\noutperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines.

In this study, we systematically\ncompare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled\nsemantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.\n(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,\nevaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.\nOur findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different\nerror types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity\nfor colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender\nerrors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who\njudge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these\nmodels may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack\nthe perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is\nshaped by distinct neural mechanisms.

In\nthis work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such\nbiases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.\nFocusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to\nidentify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the\nstability, localization, and generalizability of these components across\ndataset and linguistic variations.

We\nintroduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate\ninstruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a\nstring is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of\nLLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a\nlarge number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.\nBecause the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as\nLLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,\nmitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and\nfind that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the\ngrammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced\nLLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars\nand samples, in line with theoretical expectations.

Because these methods\npossess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of\ntheoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to\nreturn to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve\nthe TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural\nnetwork models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are\nfirst generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and\nnoise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and\nthe micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour\nmodel. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a\ntwo-dimensional point cloud.

Existing per-scene\noptimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational\ncosts, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions\noutside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open\nGaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D\nreconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open\nGaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic\nconsistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are\ninitialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent\ninpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces\nbidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion\nmodel.

In SRR, document parsing is abstracted\ninto three fundamental questions - \"Where is it?\" (structure), \"What is it?\"\n(recognition), and \"How is it organized?\" (relation) - corresponding to layout\nanalysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused\ndecomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable\nprocessing without sacrificing precision.

TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing\non temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the\nsame video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct\neach <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences\nbetween clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with\nmultiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such\nas sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose\nTF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video\nencoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally\ndiscriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos\nusing contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,\nvideo, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained\ncomposed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,\nTF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and\nafter fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.", "AI": {"tldr": "TF-CoVR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2-\u4fee\u6539\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6TF-CoVR-Base\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CoVR\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTF-CoVR\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2-\u4fee\u6539\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1TF-CoVR-Base\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "TF-CoVR-Base\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0cmAP@50\u5206\u522b\u4ece5.92\u63d0\u5347\u52307.51\u548c\u4ece19.83\u63d0\u5347\u523025.82\u3002", "conclusion": "TF-CoVR\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cTF-CoVR-Base\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, computing exact\nShapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature\ndimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes.

However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the\nquality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt\nstrategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can\nbe both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we\nexplore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse\nretrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel\nfusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse\nretrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query\nexpansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval\nroutes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented\nquery. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses\nthem using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Existing\nmethods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically\nrequire dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,\nreal-world use.

To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing\nthat 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and\nthe pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we\nobserve that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our\ninvestigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment\ncapabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent\nanswer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D\nencoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene\nunderstanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset\ndesigned to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our\nfindings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for\nbetter 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e863D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b03D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb3D\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a763D VLMs\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u7c7b3D VLMs\u4e3a3D\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u30012D\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7840\u548c3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b03D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf93D\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u59822D VLMs\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u6536\u76ca\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb3D\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Inspired by how new\nsoftware is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be\nstudied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)\nthan other models of comparable depth.

In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms.

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis.

To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation.

Despite\nextensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output\nquality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive\ntraining. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,\nhandle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a\nVision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based\ninterface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity\ndetection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then\nprompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles\nthat best align with user instructions.

This has compelled regulators to impose stringent\ncontrols on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading\nthese controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into\nsmaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve\nmultiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has\nbecome an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have\nfocused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has\nhindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a\nnovel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single\ninterpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction\nnetwork of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,\nGARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection\npower and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML\nworkflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score\ncalculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores\nof the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic\nand open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art smurfing detection methods.

With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

Despite these benefits, code\nreview can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human\nfactors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review\nprocess have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting\ndeep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by\ncommenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment\ngeneration task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to\naddress a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we\nintroduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation\nby exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both\nthe semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input\nfor other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if\nthe DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected\nones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code\nrefinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus\ndeserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework.

This enables us to obtain an\nimproved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be\nused to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the\nassociated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we\napply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional\ndouble-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a\nneural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide\ntheoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3akTULA\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5168\u5c40Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5e38\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6f\u670d\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5kTULA\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u754c\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u4e3a$2-\\overline{\\epsilon}$\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "kTULA\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "POSSM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548cTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c16\u5cf0\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7334\u5b50\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPOSSM\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684Transformer\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408SSM\u662f\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u95ed\u73af\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We\nprovide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification\nproblem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts\njudiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find\nthat, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple\nadaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely\nrandomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called\nefficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when\nthe experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched\narm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at\npre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions\nunder which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely\nrandomized trials.

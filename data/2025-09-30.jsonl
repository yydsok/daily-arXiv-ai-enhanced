We also present an effective data augmentation strategy using\nguitar amplifiers which delivers near-unlimited tonal variety, of which we\nprovide a starting 29.5 hours of audio. Each recording is annotated using\nguitar tablatures, a guitar-specific symbolic format supporting string and fret\nnumbers, as well as numerous playing techniques. For this we utilise both the\nGuitar Pro format, a software for tablature playback and editing, and a\ntext-like token encoding.

We\nmeasure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\\,d_k$. Within this\nframework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it\nempirically. We show that $D_K = \\Theta(m' \\log m' / d_{\\text{model}})$ is both\nnecessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit\nconstruction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This\nscaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head\nattention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.\nWhen embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\\text{model}}$) and the graph is a\npermutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >\nd_{\\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating\ninterference that a single large head cannot disentangle.

These\nuncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental\nvariability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons\ndownstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional\ncentralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational\ncomplexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while\nexisting multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve\neffective coordination under uncertainty.

This ambiguity creates a\ndistinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single\nquestion, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is\nambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a\nsingle question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the\nreasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in\nthis setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing\nincomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce\nMultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),\na benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of\nambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142\nhigh-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a\ntaxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a\nrigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline.

While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for\nnatural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral\ndomain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an\nattempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene\nunderstanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our\nframework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent\nspace of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns\nvision features with the model's textual token representations. The two\nmodalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of\nhard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,\nalong with positive pairs.

Recently, transfer learning based methods that exploit the\nencoders pretrained on large-scale speech corpus (e.g., Wav2Vec2.0 and HuBERT)\nhave shown strong potential for downstream SER tasks. However, task-specific\nfine-tuning remains necessary for various conversational scenarios of different\ntopics, speakers and languages to achieve satisfactory performance. It\ngenerally requires costly encoder retraining for individual SER tasks. To\naddress this issue, we propose to train an adapter with local attributes for\nefficient transfer learning.

An adapter with teacher-student branches\nis exploited for task-agnostic transfer learning, where the student branch is\njointly optimized via mask prediction and self-distillation objectives, and the\nteacher branch is obtained online from the student via exponential moving\naverage (EMA). Meanwhile, local attributes are learned from the teacher branch\nvia unsupervised clustering, which aims to act as a universal model that\nprovides additional semantic-rich supervisions. A statistical attentive pooling\n(SAP) module is proposed to obtain utterance representation for fine-tuning.

Since modeling paradigms for the two types are typically different,\nresearch on different audio generation tasks has traditionally followed\nseparate trajectories. However, audio is not inherently divided into such\ncategories, making a unified model a natural and necessary goal for general\naudio generation. Previous unified audio generation works have adopted\nautoregressive architectures, while unified non-autoregressive approaches\nremain largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniFlow-Audio, a universal\naudio generation framework based on flow matching. We propose a dual-fusion\nmechanism that temporally aligns audio latents with TA features and integrates\nNTA features via cross-attention in each model block. Task-balanced data\nsampling is employed to maintain strong performance across both TA and NTA\ntasks. UniFlow-Audio supports omni-modalities, including text, audio, and\nvideo. By leveraging the advantage of multi-task learning and the generative\nmodeling capabilities of flow matching, UniFlow-Audio achieves strong results\nacross 7 tasks using fewer than 8K hours of public training data and under 1B\ntrainable parameters. Even the small variant with only ~200M trainable\nparameters shows competitive performance, highlighting UniFlow-Audio as a\npotential non-auto-regressive foundation model for audio generation.

Classical planners often generate\ninefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed\nbuffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to\nresolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense\nscenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from\nreaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra\nbuffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports\nanother, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these\nissues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.\nInspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,\nmovable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both\nfeasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in\nlarge-scale settings where space is abundant.

Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language\nmodels (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they\nrely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded\npositional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but\nforces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens\nacross modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that\nefficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we\npropose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups\nsemantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.\nBy inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic\nsignposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding\nthe model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench\nand POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without\ndisrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across\n13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on\nreasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.\nAttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B\nand QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token\ngrouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups\nrather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc\nwith additional alignment losses."}

Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,\nhighlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning.

Using AI\nmodels as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out\njudgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only\nmodel (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos.

Methods: Using GTP-4o three\nexperiments were completed.

Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all\navailable formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more\nformulations (p<0.0001).

Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as\na promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings\nfrom coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of\nrequiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and\nseed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this\nwork, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with\nimplicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling\nstrategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while\nmaintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational\ncosts. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,\ncardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based\napproaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration\napproaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among\nINR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal\ncomputational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random\nseeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized\nbasis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function\nindices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity."}

Multi-model serving further complicates\nthese trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision\nbalances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the\npervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain\nlargely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees\nand general applicability.\n  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a\nmulti-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to\nexit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the\nability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for\nachieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that\nstrategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to\nthe optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the\noptimal trade-off in polynomial time.\n  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and\nearly-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks.

Specifically, to directly combat the\n``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism\nconsisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to\nactively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive\nSummarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring\nthe model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI\nchanging awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This\nmechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically\nselect the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring\nits evaluation is always informed by the current UI context."}

Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods\nto develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user\nsimulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,\nwhich fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the\nreal world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture\nthat simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting\nunavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing\nimpatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can\nsimulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably\ndelivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our\nexperiments on MultiWOZ and $\\tau$-bench reveal significant performance\ndegradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative\nusers. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each\nnon-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue\nbreakdowns.

Although numerous efforts have been\nmade to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in\nshort, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique\nchallenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these\nmeasures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or\nspatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).\nWe lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit\ngeo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the\ngeo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors\ncontribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an\ninformation-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias\nScores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by\nshowing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this\nframework.

In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence\nof tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are\nlearned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of\nlabeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net\n(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling\nwearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing\nperformance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,\nacting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The\ntransformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across\nbody-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.\nMeanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge\nduring subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent\nfinal accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and\nregularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight\nConsolidation.

In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking\ndata from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their\ntemporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze\ntransitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,\nsuggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize\nscanpaths.

GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma\nby training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses\nwithout inference-time geometric computation.

As the field moves toward\nfeedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important\nto define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become\nunsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality\nthrough deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy\nand risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key\nchallenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal\ndefinition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a\ncontroller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an\nincompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be\nenforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic\nprogram-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized\nhyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and\nfull-state feedback.

To\nsupport comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark\nof 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and\nRGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that\nassesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with\ngeneral agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing\nbenchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.\nEarth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward\nscientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth\nobservation.

To\naddress this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency\nby pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even\nclaimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings\nsuggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire\ntransferable knowledge through continued inversion.

We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and\nNVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and\nreal-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods\nstruggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably\nneutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two\nscale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the\nclassic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to\nFP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and\nformat-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of\nhigh-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible\noverhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of\nthe activations.

A major AV\nproblem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted\nenvironments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and\nprocessing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in\nmany practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the\nplacement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more\ninformative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective\nreconstruction of the environment of interest.

A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute\nsubspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding\noffline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown\nparameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is\nhigh dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible\nor unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,\nintroduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural\nnetwork as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further\nsimplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting\nsubspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace.

This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake\nscenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader\nAI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such\ncontent becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the\nintegrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a\nphysically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that\ndefocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a\ndepth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured\nimages due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images\noften lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these\ndiscrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative\nfeature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or\nfrequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging\nprinciples and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and\ngeneralizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature\nanalyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a\nreliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images.

Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have\nattracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful\nability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,\npre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively\nleveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature\nextraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages\nmultimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover\nclassification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy\nto encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral\nimage-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features\nhierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer\nnetworks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and\ncross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to\nenhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and\nfeature similarity of individual subnetworks.

We address\nthis gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes\nmultimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are\ndistributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional\nmodalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient\nreasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts\nperformance.

We address\nthis challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis\nproblem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated\ndemonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified\nmodality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without\nrequiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system\nto communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users\ntaught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of\nparticipants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90\npercent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced\nunique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to\nteach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline\nmitigation strategies."}

To address these issues, we propose\nAdaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation\nfrom fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value\nestimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation\nby allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer\nsamples for those that are easier to estimate.

With AMCS, we construct a large-scale\ndataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training\nPRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic\ncomplexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.\nIntuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict\nattention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.\nSuch approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and\nclearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity\nbehaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in\neach head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising\nsteps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention\nmethods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to\ncapture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in\nearly denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel\nsparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only\nrequires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them\nacross all steps.

Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation\n(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to\ndistributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across\ntasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we\nstudy the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce\nhigh-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,\nin the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become\nstrongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and\naligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1\nvariant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the\ndominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach\nto encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On\nclass-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,\nImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces\nforgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines.

We show that the standard KD ->\nAlign workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable\nbehaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that\nreversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first\nbe performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions\nare threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the\nreference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental\nlevel. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians\nexperiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model\nperformance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM\nalignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively\nalign target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target\nprecision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these\nbehaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower\nvariance.

Reliable confidence estimation\nhas been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face\npractical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally\nexpensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)\ndeviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),\nwhere models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,\nmight), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this\ndirection, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging\nexpressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a\nlightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero\ncost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of\nLC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs\nunderperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves\ncompetitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a\nfine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our\nwork positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and\nhuman-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper\nexploration of this promising yet underexplored direction."}

Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text\nencoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on\nmitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we\nobserve that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial\nskewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space.

When integrated into\ndownstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\\times$ faster convergence\nrate and an 18.9\\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \\rightarrow 13.3$), which may be\nattributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.\nFurthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its\npotential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based\ntokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation.

But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where\nthe student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how\ndoes subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens.

The Solver\ncontinuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both\nsuccessful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly\nchallenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator\ndistills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,\nhigh-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a\nself-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.\nRemarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B\nachieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis\nmethods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,\nOlympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3\nand GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from\nSocratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance\ncompared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,\nincluding Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,\nand Claude-4.1-Opus."}

This paradigm gap\nprevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic\n4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,\nthe first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene\nunderstanding and generation.

This raises a critical question for\nthe field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work\ndemonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model\nparameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three\ninterpretations are possible, with relative differences between different\ninterpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps\nsurprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not\nmeaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the\ncompute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,\nthe tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute\nbudget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have\nbeen without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing\nmodel parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results\nare most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the\notherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,\nChinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations.

Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge\ndistillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing\nimage details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and\nthe pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained\nreconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the\ninitial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is\nflexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen\ndoses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,\nSuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.\nFull qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data\nshow that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of reconstruction and generalization performance."}

Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric\nretrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by\nconventional metrics.

RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on\nall Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel\nvariations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods\noffer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is\noften costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this\nby automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a\nshort, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only\nonce with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from\nbroadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting\n(x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable\nlocalization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video\nmonitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data\ncollection under key factors such as tracking precision and label\nsynchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark\ntraditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions\nand device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization,\nvalidating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use.

Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show\nthat VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic\ndata and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream\nmodels to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models."}

In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the\nmodality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different\nmodalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression.

Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified\nflow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and\nT2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient\nlatent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained\nin this latent space representation.

It employs vision modules to extract the\nspatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial\nexpression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective\nenables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When\nmisalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and\napplied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing\ndirection and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two\nbenchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our\nframework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%\nusing only a single round of correction."}

To address these challenges, a skeleton-based\nrobust registration framework is presented, which introduces a\ncorruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness\nand accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the\nregistration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the\ncorrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal\nregistration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to\nenforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which\nsignificantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures\nthat the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the\nglobal stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate\nregistration results.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model\nfor Web API recommendation.

The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is\ndetermined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M).\nAdditionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category\njudgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection.

Existing variants of\ndifferential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise\ninto every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing\nmodel accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients\nassociated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,\nstrengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve\nthe model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight\nthrough Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of\nvanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive\nand non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage\nof training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a\nresult, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight\npost-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise\nprimarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally\naffecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated\ninto any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to\nnon-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure.

In this study, we investigate\nthe impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years\nand decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative\ndeep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6\nensemble.

Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the\nconstraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity\njudgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI\nmodels as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out\njudgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only\nmodel (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos.

We\npropose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which\nsynthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set\nof question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs\nthe video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which\ngenerates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question\nin specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use\nthis synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token\nprediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our\napproach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new\nstate-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\\% on STAR\n(+4.9\\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis\nreveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset\ngeneralization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over\n2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated\nfacts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,\nefficient, and generalizable training paradigm."}

To address these limitations, we introduce\nTokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the\ncompositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed\ntargeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object\nrelationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate\noutputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their\nrelationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap\ninjects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the\ngrammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,\nthe poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,\nmaking it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address\nthis, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly\nemphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and\nbags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior\nevasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM\narchitectures."}

Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)\nhave emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing\nstrong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application\nto UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test\nquality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often\ncauses a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this\nlimitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically\ntailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests\ntargeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns.

On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability\ngeneralizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions\nunseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that\ncompositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target\ntask. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,\nrequiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative\nanalysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the\nmodels. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of\nthese findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM\nlearning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,\nthen using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex\nproblems."}

Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings.

Despite their success in general domains,\napplying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited\navailability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most\nexisting medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus\nprimarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and\nclinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nVietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired\nCT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This\ndataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)\nthe lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which\nhinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;\nand (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the\nVietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report\npairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'\nlearning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on\ndownstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question\nanswering.

Existing studies\nhave observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them\noften come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves\nperformance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three\niterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other\nmethods (Figure 1).

While\nleveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is\nintuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping\ninformation between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this\nissue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only\nmaximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise\nrepresentation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple\nmaximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our\naugmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques\nto mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced\nlearning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and\nreal-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches\nbased on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally,\nby integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we\nestablish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that\nincorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy.

In\nthis work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying\nfive key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural\nperspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size\n($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).\nSpecifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their\nmarginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE\nscaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the\ntheoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations\nfor $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that\nthe optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model\narchitecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation\nparameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could\nfunction as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model\ndesign and training."}

Unlike training a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes\nlow-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of\nfoundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze\nthe encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent\nspace; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic\npreservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while\nretaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved\nreconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image\ntokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, our\ntokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of\n1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without\nclassifier-free guidance.

To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a\ngeneral framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging\na deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch\napproach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the\nquality of the base model.

To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with\na lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are\naligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base\nmodel's inherent generation quality.

Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building\nat Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed\nmulti-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual\napproaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations\nwith mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In\ncontrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m\nin areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization\nare between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift."}

StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts\nfor data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised\nLearning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a\n96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone\nscenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained\nbackbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted\nmodels to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust\ndefense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary\ndefense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its\npotential to mitigate such attacks."}

Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the\nutilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet\noften fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges,\nin this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected\nviews to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate\nthe captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous\ndiffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by\nintroducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation\nduring the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a\ncommitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained\nvisual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a\nguiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier.

Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text\nencoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on\nmitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings.

With no analytic expression of the\noptimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian\noptimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using\nonly a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.\nNumerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the\nbenefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal\ncamera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and\ngeneralize well on similar unknown environments."}

First, we\nobserve that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not\nhonestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose\ncross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which\nthe quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based\nsmoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and\nleverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible\noverhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.\nWe evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and\nsuccessfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual\nquality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our\ncode is available at\n\\hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}."}

In addition to\nthe hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data\nthrough mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of\ngeofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches\nassume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can\nonly handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse\nresolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and\nhigh-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with\npolitical district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and\nmedian barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary\nshapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our\nformulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences\nto 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1\ninteger programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as\nquadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient\napproximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized\nquadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to\nextract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables\nflexible geofence design."}

To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability\nWeighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate\nheavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed\n$\\textbf{RPEX}$: $\\textbf{R}$obust $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{EX}$pansion.\nExtensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves\nSOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

Traditional methods, such as empirical\nmodel-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement\nrequirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches\noften struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave\nequation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network\n(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for\nAP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss\ndistributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN\nto create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,\nsignificantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In\nthe DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the\naction space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal\nimprovement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances\nconvergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the\nlikelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show\nthat the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and\ntraditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received\npower, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency.

In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct\n(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation\nmodels by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language\nmodel (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM\ncounterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical\npart of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of\nintegral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We\nalso introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state\nmatching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly\nimprove the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference\nperformances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated\nlanguage generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard\ndLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128\nNFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss\nof about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further\nvalidate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive\nablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein\nsequences.

While previous research accelerates\ndiffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy\nwithin the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a\ngeneral framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging\na deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch\napproach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the\nquality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the\nrepresentation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply\ncompressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct\nfine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with\na lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are\naligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base\nmodel's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA\nand FLUX.1-Krea.

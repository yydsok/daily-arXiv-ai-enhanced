In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states.

The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches\nthat integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,\nNetlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of\nlanguage-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of\nclassical rule-based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u5236\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5021\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff1b2\uff09\u8c03\u67e5LLMs\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6216\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06LLMs\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u5e73\u53f0\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002"}}

OmniGSE bridges this gap by integrating the\nstrengths of discriminative and generative approaches through a two-stage\narchitecture that enables cross-domain collaborative optimization. In the first\nstage, continuous features are enhanced using a lightweight channel-split\nNAC-RoFormer. In the second stage, discrete tokens are generated to reconstruct\nhigh-quality speech through language models. Specifically, we designed a\nhierarchical language model structure consisting of a RootLM and multiple\nBranchLMs. The RootLM models general acoustic features across codebook layers,\nwhile the BranchLMs explicitly capture the progressive relationships between\ndifferent codebook levels. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniGSE\nsurpasses existing models across multiple benchmarks, particularly excelling in\nscenarios involving compound distortions.

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics.

Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --\ni.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,\nwe derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism\nand propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow\nmatching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed\nequivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated\nand real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed\nprojection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory\ncosts. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane\nfeatures consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving\nhigher performance with only a modest computational overhead.

Critical to ML-ADAS is the\ncollision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and\nestimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs\nlike YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,\ndetection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features\nextracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,\nthe robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in\nobject detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor\nattack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike\nexisting attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox\nsubtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in\ndataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting\ndownstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized\nin the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with\nonly a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.\nFurthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning\nstrategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in\ndownstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially\nresulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aShrinkBox\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ADAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u5c0f\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u6765\u7834\u574f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfADAS\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ADAS\uff08ML-ADAS\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u529f\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShrinkBox\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728YOLOv9m\u548cKITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a96%\uff0c\u4ec5\u97004%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u8d85\u8fc73\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ShrinkBox\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9ML-ADAS\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Effectively querying this data is essential\nto enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying\nby defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each\naligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on\nindexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide\naccurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,\nstate-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object\ncounts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this\nlimitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for\naccurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing\non accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding\nobject centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance\nwith a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling\nbetter handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To\nadapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model\nselection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each\ninput.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively\nenhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error\npatterns, and both dense and sparse architectures.

Prior work can be categorized\ninto two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then\ncluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods\nincorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.\nHowever, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve\nsegmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in\nwhether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up\nstrategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent\nself-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a\nlexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic\nprogramming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On\nthe five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable\nstate-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times\nfaster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of\nES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate\nboundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as\nwell. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.\nTherefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering\ntechniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to\nlearn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies\non rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current\nscenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a\nbalance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which\nprogressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising\napproach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.\nHowever, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,\nfocusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.\nThis work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum\nlearning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively\ngenerates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive\nmechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring\nexposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales.

Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm.

This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

This analysis uses a\nstructured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three\ndifferent professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a\nhierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive\ngrammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current\nLLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular\nLLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google\nGemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600\nresponses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate\nstereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'\npronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in\nAI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in\nthe workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.\nUnderstanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and\nassuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather\ncontribute to more equitable outcomes.

Videos and images\ngenerated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more\ndifficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new\nmodels to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted\nto solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly\ninteracts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using\nsolely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of\nboth deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an\napproach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on\nidentifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image\nprocessing.

This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel\nBalance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical\nfibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human\nstudy. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled\nsway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human\nstudy, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in\ncombination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway\nmean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,\nand sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability\nwas evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values\ngreater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were\nconsidered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent\nICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed\nmoderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman\nplots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the\nFP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP.

Generative models have\nbeen widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation\napplications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in\ngenerating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images\nfrom these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and\nscan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work\nformulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image\ndiffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ\ncommonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.\nFurthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images\ngenerated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and\ntexture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u9510\u5229\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8111\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8111\u90e8MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528FID\u548cLPIPS\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9510\u5ea6\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8111\u90e8MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

Reservoir\ncomputing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional\ndeep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly\nstructured and fixed reservoir network.

Addressing this issue, we propose a\nnovel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that\nsystematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input\ntraining sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)\ntechnique, which converts time series data into networks by representing\nmeasurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network\nis constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data\nsequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid\nexpensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is\ndirectly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.\nWe assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical\nnonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.\nCompared to an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and\ncomparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent\nperformance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff08DyRC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\uff08VG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Duffing\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDyRC-VG\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi\u56fe\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DyRC-VG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u76f4\u63a5\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer\nmodule that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively\ncapturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing\nthe quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel\ncontrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative\npower of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module\nincreases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original\nfeature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for\nsubsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental\nresults on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced\nmethods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the\nCora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,\nrespectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.", "AI": {"tldr": "GCL-GCN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Graphormer\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGCL-GCN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Graphormer\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGCL-GCN\u4f18\u4e8e14\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728Cora\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aACC\u3001NMI\u548cARI\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53474.94%\u300113.01%\u548c10.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "GCL-GCN\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing privacy-preserving data\npublishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,\nparticularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address\nthis gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel\nprivacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging\nGaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition.

To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt\noptimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn\nhigh-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or\nmore LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool\ncalls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose\nproblems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons\nfrom the Pareto frontier of its own attempts.

By continuously assessing students, our\nframework enhances instructional strategies, ensuring that the materials\npresented are relevant and engaging. Experimental results indicate a marked\nimprovement in both learner engagement and knowledge retention when using a\ncustomized curriculum.

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability.

First, our Adaptive\nSemantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused\nsemantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local\ncontext to guide reconstruction.

Owing to limited computational resources, operational\nmedium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,\nwhich are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of\nthe CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of\nCNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For\ncomparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with\nthe CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN\ncorrection before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the reverse approach.

In\nmedical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,\nraising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual\nexplanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by\npresenting hypothetical \"what-if\" scenarios that alter model classifications.\nBy examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns\nthat influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating\nplausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing\nhuman-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While\ndeep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit\nsignificant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks\n(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By\nmodeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we\nleverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a\ngiven discrimination task.

In medicine, these models can admit\nconflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly\nunderstood and insufficiently addressed.\n  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications\nof predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model\narchitectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate\npredictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard\nvalidation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a\nsubstantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model\ndevelopment.

Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness.

To tackle this challenge, we propose\nScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,\nwhich aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of\nthe current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure\ndubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene\nconcepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be\ndynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more\nconsistent and immersive 3D view sequences.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.

Specifically, many\nreal-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or\nnon-existent, \\eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific\nconditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale\ntraining, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.\nTo address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the\nscarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive\ndata containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions\ndemand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable\nwidespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically\nobserve that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the\naffirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware\nTest-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related\nparameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in\nconsistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in\nunrelated semantics.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

Existing methods primarily extract\nfeatures at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal\nsimilarities effectively.

This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive\nlocal features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in\nrobust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the\npractical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object\ndetection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay.

Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical\nguarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case\nSeries (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aPACC Discovery\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5219\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPACC Discovery\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SCCS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "PACC Discovery\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We adapt the power of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input\nand convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate\nmulti-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.\nSpecifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a\ndynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a\nwell-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we\nsynthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial\nguidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive\ncontext, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the\nretrieval of precise coordinates.

Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar\nsubsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time.

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object\ndetection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction.

To address that, we propose a MultiStream\nDetection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information\nfrom both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its\nLiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input\nwhile the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An\nadditional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV\nmapping and polar coordinate indexing.

However, identifying\n3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite\nexplicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud\nbackbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to\nadequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the\ndisparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data\nsimply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth\nand appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the\nflexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly\nGenerator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies\nin RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,\neffectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can\ndirectly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.\nExperiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD\nand Eyecandies datasets.

Due to the high\nreliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial\nto resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex\ncloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to\ndiagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible\nsince they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.\n  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible\nplatform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The\nplatform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial\ndata collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag\nsupports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.\nDependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting\nin a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are\nmonitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of\nthe graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies.

However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects.

The\nresulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver\ndataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without\nretraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86\nMRIs, 37 patients).\n  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and\nprompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),\n0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain).

Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a\nnovel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed\ntotal generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that\nthe feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise\nconstant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to\ncharacterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly\nintroduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures\nand getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve\nthe new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and\ncomparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that\nour method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In\naddition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art\ntechniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark.

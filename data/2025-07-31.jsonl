This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

In this chapter, a a\nsoil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in\norder to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust\nautonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended\nto incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade\nthrough the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately\ntracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a\nflat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of\ncutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building\nupon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to\nextract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,\nand an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to\npredict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a\ncompact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to\ntrain the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the\nmapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in\nthe map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner.

Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and\nCC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement.

Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic\nmatter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed\nwith a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the\nparticles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic\nmatter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between\nlong-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and\nfrustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures\nof criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition\nis a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle\ninteractions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of\nrobotic systems."}

Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.PL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers\nachieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\\times$ to 4.8$\\times$ compared to\nusing widely-used initial seeds.

In this paper, we propose\nMMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning\nframework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three\nmain components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that\nleverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a\nself-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and\nlearns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation\naggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic\nand task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training\ndata, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct\nextensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC\noutperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and\n39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that\nMMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items."}

In this work, we propose a\nnovel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework\nintegrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to\nextract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of\nExperts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to\ndifferent visual dimensions.

We train MoCHA on two\nmainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance\nacross various benchmarks.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the\npreparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth\nmargin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683).

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,\ncompared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\\% to\n48.29\\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\\% to 53.28\\%, and test coverage\nby 0.78\\% to 53.96\\%.

Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative\nreinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,\nfreely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by\nhaving access to a \"simulator\". By employing known classical and new quantum\nalgorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within\nour learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms\nfrom RL like \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" and \"posterior sampling\" and\ninstead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret\nbounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum\nalgorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number\nof time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This\nmatches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.\n(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other\nparameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For\ninfinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we\npropose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to\nwhich our quantum algorithms have $\\operatorname{poly}\\log{T}$ regret,\nexponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise\nall of our results to compact state spaces."}

However, it has been found that ICL's\nperformance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This\npaper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:\nwe observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the\npositions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are\nvaried. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We\ndesign a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias\nacross classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.\nWe introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify\nnet gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.\nExtensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,\nLLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their\naccuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the\nmost stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,\nplacing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\\% of predictions\nwithout improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by\nthis sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on\ncomplex tasks."}

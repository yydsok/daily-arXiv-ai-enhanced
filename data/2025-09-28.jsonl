Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks.

However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver.

The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time.

We introduce the Domain Aware\nRule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal\nclustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly\ninto the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture\nby embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features\ninto a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule\nconsistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional\nclustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post\nhoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules\nare generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a\nloss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and\nviolation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets\ndemonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful\nand interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth\naircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering\nmetrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may\nhallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to\ncomplex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By\ncombining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more\nmeaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,\nhighlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for\ncomplex, knowledge intensive settings."}

However, even\nwell-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich\nenvironments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through\nretraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned\nskills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies."}

Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations.

Prior research on long-term\nskill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or\nemploys other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this\ngap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic\nshared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers\nacquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an\nautonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a\nhighly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism\nalong with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from\nautonomy based on the human driver's performance during training.

Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal\nthe intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive\nfinite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes\ntechniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a\npolynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear\ndynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital\nmodel, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially\nfewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with\nkernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and\nprincipled at scale."}

The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the\ntraining set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical\nand challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization\n(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training\ndata, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG\nmethods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of\ninaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel\ndual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.\nBuilding upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross\npseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level\nsupervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This\nfeature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision\ncaused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing\ncomplementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two\ndistinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to\nenhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model\ncollapse.

Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as\nknowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions\nas visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the\ncaptions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and\nLLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning\ncapabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank\nAugmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to\nconvert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples\nfor the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to\nexclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to\nunderstand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the\nmodel's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end\ntraining. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently\non two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving\naccuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%.

The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled\nvoice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that\nremain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate\ntwo SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:\nLLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,\nwhereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content\nfidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly\ndiagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models."}

We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into\ninterpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and\nbuild practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more\nrobust against Gaussian noise."}

Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,\nmost existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In\nthis study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial\nstates through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose\nthe concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's\ncompetitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly\nshaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error\nbound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a\nfine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training\ncontroller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a\nprincipled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals\nand thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a\ncomputationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information\ndecomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into\nfine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and\nsynergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically\nbalances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial\nstate to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nOur work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a\npowerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking\nsynergistic multi-modal fusion."}

However, the\ncompute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance\nbenefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as\nshared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that\ncombines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.\nTyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive\nformulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while\nreducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb\nformulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention\ncalculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with\nonly a 3% overhead in HBM size."}

Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the\nmodel output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a\nwell-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks\nto uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised\ncounterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent\nspace. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning\nprovide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,\nwithout automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided\nby their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too\nreductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning\nmethods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative\nspatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable\nAssociations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local\nembedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To\nachieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities\n(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original\nfeatures, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the\nentire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney\ndataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with\nvisually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly\ndistant regions of the latent spaces."}

To address these, we\npropose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a\nsign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between\nvisual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic\ncontext; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises\nagreements across different levels of paired features from different\nmodalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level\nsemantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines\ncontrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic\nconsistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on\nisolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and\ngloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different\nsign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative\npre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution\nfor SLU."}

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the\nonline mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously\nexploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and\nenhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models\nnot only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing\nschedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria\nare introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time\ntraining, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,\nthus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical\nenvironments."}

However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary\nperson classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack\nsuccess rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%\n(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and\nfacebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the\ncross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,\nwith pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model\nresilience to adversarial attacks."}

In addition to images,\nHunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose\npriors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,\ntopology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model\nunifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a\nprogressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control\nmodality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal\npose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust\nmulti-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show\nthat these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable\ngeometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production\nworkflows."}

We investigate this question in the\nclassical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear\nobservations $Y_i = X_i^{\\top}\\theta + \\epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the\ngeneralization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed\nas linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X)\nY_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules --\nencompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators,\nincluding ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our\ncontributions are twofold.

We introduce\nDisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer\nwith a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic\nstructure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to\nyield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's\ngrammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are\nfactorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of\nmillions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised\ncontrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and\nword order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,\nboosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves\n93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark.

Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,\nportions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model\nparameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin\nmaximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for\ngeneralization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical\ndemonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and\nlacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary\nperspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent\nweaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify\nconditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without\nincorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many\nalternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,\nrendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further\ndemonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.\nOur results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage\nis possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and\ntherefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,\nless susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need\nfor strong generalization in this setting."}

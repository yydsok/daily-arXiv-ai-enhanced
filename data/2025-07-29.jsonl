Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research\ndirections, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to\nenhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic\nmulti-agent environments."}

To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,\nknowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal\nassurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the\nmodes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with\na supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the\nprimary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains.

Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily\nfocused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To\naddress this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly\nestimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a\nneural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and\nclassifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured\ndata more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion\nproperty. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and\nedges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the\nexponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,\nwhere changes in effect order can result in different final sounds.

Our experiments demonstrate\nthat domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.\nAt the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models\nimprove QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving\nexams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the\npotential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education."}

Lightweight Narrative Annotation of Christian Fiction with LMs", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American\nEvangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural\nand literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and\nwhat scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left\nBehind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad\ntopical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed\nexploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human\nannotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for \"acts of God.\" We\nthen adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a\nrecent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The\nlaptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is\nsubtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and\nmeaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian\nFiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors."}

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper.

Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query\nparadigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.\nFurthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention\ndisentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many\nprocess), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),\naddressing \"query ambiguity\" and \"ROT\" issues directly, and enhancing decoder\nefficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size\npriors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.\nExtensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and\nWiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of\nDS-Det.

To address\ninter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained\nincreasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal\nimaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation\nmethod within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we\nexplore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib\nstructures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone\nsurface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related\nsignals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic\nnoise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile\npoint cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human\npalpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,\nthe sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a\ndenser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an\nimage-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping\nfor individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of\ninterest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize\nstructures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted\ncomprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning\nwaypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff\ndistance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the\nreconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared\nto the CT ground truth."}

In\nthis work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,\nfrom which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.\nIn particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object\nlocalization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region\nexpansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the\nsemantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively\nspread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale\nself-attention maps.

Different from many online\nPOMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing\n(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to\nconstruct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and\nusers can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.\nMoreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation\nclustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain\ncontinuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate\npolicies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous\noffline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with\nthe state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms."}

Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

Recent advanced generative models designed for\nprotein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),\nScore Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and\nFrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly\ninvestigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.\nFurthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical\nfoundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future\nalgorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we\nrelease the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework\nfor SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at\nhttps://github.com/BruthYU/protein-se3."}

In this paper, we\npresent ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that\nfully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer\n(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating\nmultimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to\nmultimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal\nMulti-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB\ndata with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,\nsegmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate\ninformation-rich hybrid attention maps.

Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To\nmitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase\napproximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned\ndata traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from\n\"pseudo-convergence\", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but\nstill preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification\nand generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach\nmaintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack\naccuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full\nretraining from scratch."}

This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL\nnot only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also\nextends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment\n(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as\ngeneral-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in\nvertical problems such as noisy label cleansing.

However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,\nHypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,\npotentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge."}

They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects.

To overcome these limitations, we propose\nNeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded\nEEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach\noffers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.\nValidation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves\ndiscriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and\nhealthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.\nFurthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based\nevaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in\nneural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment.

It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios.

For a distinct, geometrically\nregular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under\nnon-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique\nalong any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify\nthe fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global\nregularity required by our existence proof.

To rigorously evaluate the\nNL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework\ncomprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and\nSpearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical\ntranslation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA\nachieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational\noverhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the\npotential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building\nefficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains."}

To further explore the field of backdoor attacks\nagainst semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective\nbackdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg\nleverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models\nto enhance backdoor performance.

The system's tractability is predicated not on\nconvexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and\nglobally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this\nhypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish\nwell-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically\nregular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under\nnon-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique\nalong any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify\nthe fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global\nregularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator\ndefines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection\nto fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula."}

This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard\nperformance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's\nefficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.

Most existing ownership protection\nsolutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based\nAI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale\ndistribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a\nunique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and\nmodifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking\nmethod. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently\nembedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nmodule, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through\nbranch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the\nwatermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without\ndegrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is\ncompatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including\nclassification, image generation, and text generation.

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions.

Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories.

Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations.

First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity.

### [1] [Strongly Solving $7 \times 6$ Connect-Four on Consumer Grade Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05267)
*Markus Böck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，成功生成了一个89.6 GB的查找表，解决了标准7×6棋盘大小的Connect-Four游戏强解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Connect-Four游戏已通过数学方法解决，但强解形式的查找表被认为不可行，本文旨在探索其可行性。

Method: 采用基于二元决策图的符号搜索方法，并结合高效的实现，生成了强解查找表。

Result: 在单核CPU和128 GB内存的条件下，47小时内生成了89.6 GB的查找表，并提供了最快胜利或最慢失败的搜索功能。

Conclusion: 本文证明了通过符号搜索方法生成强解查找表的可行性，并提供了开源工具支持进一步研究。

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

### [2] [Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283)
*Yue Wang,Miao Zhou,Guijing Huang,Rui Zhuo,Chao Yi,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT利用大型语言模型（LLM）将用户半结构化、模糊的交通信号控制计划描述转换为精确的信号相位与时间（SPaT）结果，准确率超过94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统定时交通信号控制计划创建和更新中繁琐的手动工作问题。

Method: 通过LLM理解用户描述并生成JSON格式的相位序列和属性，再通过Python脚本组装完整信号控制计划。

Result: 实验显示，Chat2SPaT在300多个测试案例中准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT为交通从业者和研究人员提供了易用的计划管理工具，是LLM在智能交通系统中应用的新范例。

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 证明了对于连续个体分类的最优、独立且零一致的模糊分类聚合函数必须是加权算术平均。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模糊分类聚合函数的性质，特别是在多对象和多类型分类中的最优性和一致性。

Method: 通过数学证明，分析满足最优、独立和零一致条件的模糊分类聚合函数。

Result: 发现满足条件的聚合函数只能是加权算术平均。

Conclusion: 加权算术平均是唯一满足最优、独立和零一致性的模糊分类聚合函数。

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy
classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual
classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted
arithmetic mean.

### [4] [OLG++: A Semantic Extension of Obligation Logic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05488)
*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jon Stephens,Amarnath Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OLG++是Obligation Logic Graph（OLG）的语义扩展，用于建模市政和跨辖区的法规和法律规则，支持更丰富的节点和边类型，提升法律知识表示的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律知识表示模型在表达复杂法律规则（如空间、时间、例外等）时存在局限性，需要更丰富的语义扩展。

Method: OLG++引入空间、时间、群体、可废止性等节点和边类型，支持结构化推理和复杂触发条件。

Result: OLG++在食品业务法规示例中展示了其表达能力，优于现有图模型和LegalRuleML。

Conclusion: OLG++为法律知识表示提供了更丰富的语义支持，适用于复杂法律规则的建模和推理。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

### [5] [Deep Research Comparator: A Platform For Fine-grained Human Annotations of Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05495)
*Prahaladh Chandrahasan,Jiahe Jin,Zhihan Zhang,Tevin Wang,Andy Tang,Lucy Mo,Morteza Ziyadi,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Zimeng Qiu,Markus Dreyer,Akari Asai,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Deep Research Comparator平台，用于评估和比较深度研究代理，支持详细反馈和排名计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度研究代理在生成报告和中间步骤评估上的挑战。

Method: 开发了一个平台，支持代理报告对比、中间步骤评估和反馈收集，并提供了一个基线代理Scaffold。

Result: 收集了17位注释者的真实偏好数据，展示了平台的实用性。

Conclusion: 平台为深度研究代理的开发和评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4d2dnbdseg.

### [6] [Fine-Grained Vision-Language Modeling for Multimodal Training Assistants in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05515)
*Haochen Huang,Jiahuan Pei,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Xin Sun,Moonisa Ahsan,Pablo Cesar,Chuang Yu,Zhaochun Ren,Junxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对增强现实（AR）训练的数据集，评估了九种先进的视觉语言模型（VLM），发现即使是GPT-4o等模型在细粒度任务上表现不佳，呼吁改进数据集和基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在AR训练中的应用，填补研究空白，并为盲人和视障用户提供平等的学习机会。

Method: 构建了一个系统化的视觉语言任务数据集，并评估了九种先进的VLM模型。

Result: 高级模型在细粒度任务（如状态检测）上表现不佳，最高F1分数仅为40.54%。

Conclusion: 需要改进数据集和基准以提升视觉语言对齐能力，同时研究具有广泛的社会意义。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

### [7] [Modeling (Deontic) Modal Operators With the s(CASP) Goal-directed Predicated Answer Set Programming System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05519)
*Gopal Gupta,Abhiramon Rajasekharan,Alexis R. Tudor,Elmer Salazar,Joaquín Arias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用ASP中的默认否定和强否定优雅地表达道义模态逻辑，并通过全局约束解决其悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决道义模态逻辑的实现问题，尤其是其悖论的表达与处理。

Method: 利用答案集编程（ASP）中的默认否定和强否定表达模态算子，并使用全局约束表示义务和禁止。

Result: 提出的方法能够优雅地解决道义模态逻辑中的各种悖论。

Conclusion: ASP中的否定机制和全局约束为道义模态逻辑的实现提供了有效且优雅的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how
(deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation
(negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming
(ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and
impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed
representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being
elegantly resolved.

### [8] [Cultivating Multimodal Intelligence: Interpretive Reasoning and Agentic RAG Approaches to Dermatological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05520)
*Karishma Thakrar,Shreyas Basavatia,Akshay Daftardar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC挑战赛的第二版聚焦于多模态皮肤病问答和分割，提出了一种结合多模态模型微调、结构化推理层和检索增强生成的方法，在竞赛中取得优异成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决远程医疗中诊断决策的异步性和高准确性需求，模拟皮肤科医生的系统推理模式。

Method: 结合Qwen、Gemma和LLaMA家族的多模态模型微调，引入结构化推理层和检索增强生成技术。

Result: 团队获得第二名，提交的作品排名第六，展示了高准确性和竞争力。

Conclusion: 该架构为自动化诊断支持系统提供了更可靠的路径，适用于实际医疗场景。

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在可扩展性和利用大规模课程内容方面存在不足，且缺乏评估教学质量的框架。

Method: 提出WikiHowAgent，整合教师和学习者代理、交互管理器和评估器，基于大规模教程数据集进行实验。

Result: 评估结果显示工作流在多样化场景中有效，并提供了跨领域的大语言模型能力见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners,
bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails
to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for
assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a
multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning
conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction
manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess
pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner
conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics.
Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with
human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in
diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our
datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

### [10] [Red Teaming AI Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05538)
*Subhabrata Majumdar,Brian Pendleton,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文批判性地审视了AI红队测试的实践，指出其当前在AI治理中的局限性，并提出一个涵盖宏观系统层面和微观模型层面的综合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI红队测试在AI治理中流行，但其过于关注模型层面的缺陷，忽视了更广泛的社会技术系统和涌现行为。

Method: 提出一个两层次的框架：宏观系统红队测试和微观模型红队测试，并借鉴网络安全经验和系统理论提出建议。

Result: 强调有效的AI红队测试需要多学科团队，关注涌现风险、系统性漏洞及技术与社会因素的相互作用。

Conclusion: AI红队测试需要更全面的视角，以应对复杂的系统性问题。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

*Shovito Barua Soumma,Asiful Arefeen,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Melanie Hingle,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用GPT-4o-mini生成反事实解释（CFs）的零样本和三样本方法，在压力预测和心脏病检测数据集上表现优于传统方法，并提升了下游分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实解释（CFs）能提供人类可理解的机器学习预测解释，用于异常预防和增强数据训练。本研究旨在探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成CFs中的潜力。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini在零样本和三样本设置下生成CFs，并在AI-Readi压力预测和心脏病检测数据集上进行评估，与传统方法（DiCE、CFNOW、NICE）对比。

Result: LLM生成的CFs在合理性（99%）、有效性（0.99）和稀疏性上表现优异，且作为增强数据能提升下游分类器准确率（平均5%）。

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术能显著提升临床和生理预测任务的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

### [12] [SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05566)
*David Bensaïd,Noam Rotstein,Roy Velich,Daniel Bensaïd,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA提出了一种新的低秩适应方法，通过单低秩矩阵分解解决LoRA中的尺度冲突问题，提升训练稳定性并减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中存在尺度冲突问题，导致训练不稳定和性能下降。

Method: SingLoRA将权重更新重新表述为单低秩矩阵与其转置的乘积，消除尺度冲突并减少参数。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，如LLama 7B微调准确率91.3%，优于LoRA和LoRA+，且参数更少。

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过简单设计解决了LoRA的稳定性问题，显著提升了性能并降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

### [13] [Towards Measurement Theory for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05587)
*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个关于人工智能测量的正式理论框架，旨在实现系统比较、风险评估和测量操作标准化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI测量建立正式理论，以支持系统比较、连接前沿AI评估与工程风险分析技术，并强调测量操作对AI能力定义的影响。

Method: 提出分层的测量框架，区分直接与间接可观测性，并构建统一、可校准的AI现象分类体系。

Result: 为AI测量提供了一个理论基础，支持系统比较、风险评估和测量标准化。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI测量的统一理论奠定了基础，有助于推动研究和实践的标准化。

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Method: MLlm-DR整合小型LLMs生成抑郁症评分及解释，LQ-former从语音和视觉数据中提取特征，通过精细训练提升逻辑推理能力。

Result: 在CMDC和E-DAIC-WOZ数据集上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MLlm-DR为可解释的抑郁症诊断提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic

### [16] [ADMC: Attention-based Diffusion Model for Missing Modalities Feature Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05624)
*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,Yanbo J. Wang,En Zhu,Xuan Yang,Yiduo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力扩散模型的多模态特征补全方法（ADMC），用于解决多模态情感和意图识别中缺失模态的问题，并在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中取得了最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感和意图识别中，传感器故障或数据不完整导致的模态缺失是主要挑战，传统方法存在过耦合和生成不精确的问题。

Method: 提出ADMC框架，独立训练各模态的特征提取网络，避免过耦合，并通过注意力扩散网络（ADN）生成与真实多模态分布一致的缺失特征。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MIntRec基准测试中达到最优性能，适用于缺失和完整模态场景。

Conclusion: ADMC通过独立特征提取和注意力扩散生成，有效解决了模态缺失问题，提升了多模态识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

*Yuan An,John Liu,Niyam Acharya,Ruhma Hashmi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM生成的检索练习问题能显著提升学生知识保留率，但需人工验证质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教师生成高质量检索练习问题耗时的问题，探索LLM自动生成的可行性。

Method: 在两门大学数据科学课程中，比较使用LLM生成的多选题与无检索练习的学习效果。

Result: 使用LLM生成问题的学生知识保留率显著提高（89% vs 73%）。

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索练习问题有效，但需人工审核以确保质量。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和生成式AI的快速发展，信息传播中的虚假信息问题日益严重，传统模型无法完全捕捉在线交互的复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的模拟环境，结合SIP-CoT机制和情感引导记忆，以改进社交信息处理。

Result: 实验表明，SIP-CoT增强的LLM代理能更真实地模拟人类行为和情感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLM模拟的局限性，并证明了SIP-CoT和情感记忆在提升社交智能和真实性方面的有效性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于司法数据的表格学习方法（TLJD），用于城市级外国直接投资（FDI）预测，以解决传统经济数据可能被操纵的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动联合国可持续发展目标，促进经济持续、包容和可持续增长，FDI是关键。传统经济数据（如GDP）可能不可靠，因此利用司法数据提高预测准确性。

Method: 构建了一个基于1200万份公开裁决文件的司法绩效评估指标体系，提出TLJD方法，整合行数据和列数据，并利用专家混合模型调整指标权重。

Result: 在跨城市和跨时间任务中，TLJD表现优于其他十种先进基线方法，R2达到至少0.92。

Conclusion: TLJD通过司法数据有效提升了FDI预测的准确性，为地方政府提供了更可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

*Dipayan Sengupta,Saumya Panda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类专家和两种AI模型（通用型和推理型）生成的治疗方案，发现评估者的性质显著影响结果：人类专家更倾向于人类方案，而AI评估者更倾向于AI方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在医疗领域的扩展，评估AI生成的治疗方案成为关键挑战，尤其是新型推理模型的出现。

Method: 十位皮肤科医生、通用AI（GPT-4o）和推理AI（o3）为五个复杂皮肤病案例生成治疗方案，匿名后由人类专家和高级AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）评分。

Result: 人类专家评分显著高于AI方案，而AI评估者则完全相反，评分显著高于人类方案。推理AI在人类评估中排名靠后，但在AI评估中排名第一。

Conclusion: 临床方案的质量感知取决于评估者性质，揭示了经验启发式与数据驱动逻辑之间的差距，未来需要可解释的人机协同系统。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

*Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ModelAuditor是一个自反思代理工具，用于识别和修复AI模型在临床实践中的潜在失败模式，通过模拟分布偏移生成可解释报告，显著提升模型在真实场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在临床实践中可能因硬件、光照或人口统计等微小变化而失效，目前缺乏快速可靠的审计工具。

Method: ModelAuditor通过与用户对话选择任务指标，模拟临床相关分布偏移，生成可解释报告并提出修复策略。

Result: 在三个真实临床场景中，ModelAuditor成功识别失败模式，恢复15-25%的性能损失，成本低于0.5美元/次。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，显著提升AI模型在临床实践中的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在微电网等受限环境中难以实时监测电池SoH，亟需创新解决方案。

Method: 通过分析充电结束阶段的放电脉冲，利用等效电路模型参数估计SoH。

Result: 实验数据显示，该方法在预测电池退化时平均绝对误差约1%，解释性得分接近0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到电池管理系统（BMS）中，为持续运行的电池管理提供优化路径。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GTA1，一种图形用户界面（GUI）代理，通过测试时缩放方法和强化学习解决任务规划和视觉元素定位的挑战，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GUI代理在任务规划和视觉元素定位中的模糊性和复杂性挑战。

Method: 引入测试时缩放方法选择最佳动作提案，并使用强化学习模型提高视觉元素定位的准确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在Screenspot-Pro、Screenspot-V2和OSWorld-G上分别达到50.1%、92.4%和67.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: GTA1通过结合测试时缩放和强化学习，显著提升了GUI代理的性能，并开源了代码和模型。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在预测早产儿视网膜病变（ROP）风险中的能力，提出了新的中文数据集CROP和评估框架Affective-ROPTester，发现LLM在结合外部医学知识时表现更佳，情感因素会影响预测偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在ROP风险预测中的潜力，填补相关研究空白，并研究情感因素对模型预测的影响。

Method: 使用CROP数据集和Affective-ROPTester框架，结合三种提示策略（Instruction-based、CoT、ICL）和情感元素，评估LLM的预测能力和情感偏差。

Result: LLM在仅依赖内部知识时表现有限，结合外部知识后性能显著提升；情感偏差明显，积极情感框架有助于减少预测偏差。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester是评估和缓解临床语言模型中情感偏差的有效工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

Conclusion: MusiScene通过跨模态训练实现了音乐场景想象，为音乐理解和生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B为高性能边缘设备MLLM的发展提供了贡献，并为研究社区提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful

*Yucheng Sheng,Jiacheng Wang,Xingyu Zhou,Le Liang,Hao Ye,Shi Jin,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于无线网络中多任务预测的统一基础模型，支持不同预测区间，并展示了强大的泛化能力和零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动通信网络的复杂性和动态性增加，准确预测关键系统参数（如CSI、用户位置和网络流量）对PHY层和MAC层任务至关重要。传统深度学习方法难以泛化到不同场景和任务。

Method: 提出了一种统一的基础模型，通过单变量分解统一异构任务，编码粒度以实现区间感知，并使用因果Transformer骨干进行准确预测。训练时引入补丁掩码策略以支持任意输入长度。

Result: 在大规模数据集上训练后，该模型在未见场景中表现出强大的泛化能力，并在新任务上实现了超越传统全样本基线的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该统一基础模型为无线网络中的多任务预测提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的AI技术缺乏透明度，限制了其在医疗决策中的可解释性和接受度。

Method: 使用信息检索技术的标准指标，对基于规则的预测模型中的属性进行统计分析，计算每个属性对预测的相关性。

Result: 用户研究表明，该方法比原始可解释AI模型的输出具有更高的可解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了AI在医疗决策中的透明度和可接受性。

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁症筛查工具（如PHQ-9）缺乏互动性和适应性，限制了其效果。HopeBot旨在通过聊天机器人技术提升筛查体验。

Method: 开发了基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人HopeBot，结合检索增强生成和实时澄清功能，并与传统PHQ-9问卷进行对比研究。

Result: HopeBot与PHQ-9得分一致性高（ICC=0.91），71%用户更信任聊天机器人，87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 基于语音的大型语言模型聊天机器人可作为抑郁症筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过轻量级奖励信号生成准确的SQL，在Text-to-SQL任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言转SQL（Text-to-SQL）中复杂查询生成准确且可执行SQL的挑战。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，基于执行正确性和格式标签合规性的轻量级奖励信号，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到最先进的执行准确率，优于多个大型模型，且仅需4个NVIDIA A100 GPU训练。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了强化学习在Text-to-SQL任务中的高效性和可扩展性，并发布了两个数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法对非专业用户生成的解释不够清晰，需要一种更直观的解释方法。

Method: 提出Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS)，一种后处理方法，通过局部和全局特征重要性选择代表性样本。

Result: 在用户研究中，FGNS显著提升了非专家用户的决策速度和准确性，且选择的邻居更符合类别特征。

Conclusion: FGNS是向更人性化模型评估迈出的一步，但解释质量与用户信任之间仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

Motivation: Lockean信念集在经典逻辑演绎下通常不封闭，限制了其在信念变化理论中的应用。

Method: 提供两种闭包特征，并提出一种最小修订的更新方法。

Result: 展示了如何通过最小修订实现信念集的演绎闭包。

Conclusion: 论文解决了Lockean信念集的闭包问题，并提出了一种实用的更新方法。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

TL;DR: FEVO框架通过多阶段增强方法提升LLM在金融领域的性能，包括持续预训练、监督微调和强化学习，最终模型在多个金融基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在将LLM应用于需要领域知识的金融任务方面有限，FEVO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FEVO采用持续预训练（CPT）扩展金融知识，监督微调（SFT）培养结构化推理，强化学习（RL）整合知识与推理。

Result: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中达到最优性能，显著优于仅使用RL训练的模型。

Conclusion: FEVO框架有效提升了LLM在金融领域的性能，验证了金融知识扩展和结构化推理的重要性。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LSTM、遗传算法和SHAP的AI框架，用于医疗设施的高效能源管理，显著提升了预测准确性和能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设施的能源需求波动大，传统方法效率低下且成本高，亟需智能解决方案。

Method: 采用LSTM进行时间序列预测，结合遗传算法优化参数和负载平衡策略，并通过SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Result: LSTM在预测性能上显著优于ARIMA和Prophet（MAE和RMSE更低），遗传算法优化了实时响应，SHAP提升了决策透明度。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗能源管理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，未来可探索实时部署和强化学习的结合。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety是一个评估AI代理安全行为的模块化框架，覆盖八类关键风险，支持真实工具交互和多任务评估，发现主流LLM在51.2%至72.7%的任务中存在不安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖模拟环境或狭窄任务域，无法全面评估AI代理在真实场景中的安全风险。

Method: 提出OpenAgentSafety框架，结合真实工具交互（如浏览器、代码执行环境等）和多任务评估，采用规则分析和LLM评估检测不安全行为。

Result: 实验显示，主流LLM在安全脆弱任务中不安全行为占比51.2%（Claude-Sonnet-3.7）至72.7%（o3-mini）。

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety揭示了AI代理的安全漏洞，强调实际部署前需加强安全保障。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 通过配对偏好数据（即使数据点较弱）可以提升语言模型性能，提出delta学习假设，验证其有效性，并在实验中匹配SOTA模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用弱监督数据提升语言模型性能，尤其是在强监督稀缺的情况下。

Method: 提出delta学习假设，通过配对弱数据点的相对质量差异驱动学习，并在8B模型上验证。

Result: 在11个基准测试中匹配了Tulu 3的性能，证明了delta学习的有效性。

Conclusion: delta学习为低成本实现SOTA后训练提供了新思路，模型可以从弱配对数据中学习。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

<details>

Motivation: 在复杂或高维环境中，完整的因果图通常未知，限制了因果效应的识别。通过因果抽象简化表示，可以部分保留因果信息。

Method: 提出并形式化了多种可识别性标准，并将其组织成层次结构，以展示不同因果知识水平下的可识别性。

Result: 构建了一个清晰的层次结构框架，帮助理解在不同因果知识水平下哪些因果查询是可识别的。

Conclusion: 该框架为在缺乏完整因果知识时进行因果推理提供了工具和理论基础。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的正确评分规则在文本信息提取中未能完全对齐人类偏好，需要一种新的评分规则来同时满足正确性和人类偏好。

Method: 设计了ASR，通过最小化正确评分规则与参考评分（如人类评分）之间的均方误差来优化对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，ASR在保持正确性的同时，比之前的方法更好地对齐了人类偏好。

Conclusion: ASR是一种有效的评分规则，能够在文本信息提取中同时满足正确性和人类偏好。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的多模态虚假信息传播广泛且负面影响严重，现有MMD方法因依赖离线数据而无法适应新事件，需要在线数据流训练方法。

Method: 通过基于Dirichlet过程的混合专家结构隔离事件特定参数的干扰以记住过去知识，并通过学习连续时间动态模型预测未来环境分布。

Result: 实验表明，DAEDCMD在六种MMD基线和三种持续学习方法中表现显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DAEDCMD有效解决了持续MMD中的知识遗忘和泛化问题，为在线虚假信息检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在句子级别归因不足，无法满足用户对特定关键词（如数字、年份、名称）的验证需求。

Method: 结合Shapley值的数据归因和KNN检索技术，利用预计算的数据存储进行上下文检索，量化token重要性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在token级别归因上优于现有方法，准确率提升11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley为LLM生成响应的细粒度验证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，传统的知识检索和推理任务难以准确衡量大语言模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于用户行为预测的新框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试了GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: GPT-4o表现优于GPT-4o-mini和Llama，但所有模型仍有改进空间，尤其是Llama。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是一种更可靠且可扩展的泛化能力评估方法。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

TL;DR: ASCEND框架通过自适应监督对比学习检测隐性性别歧视，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上隐性性别歧视内容广泛传播，传统检测方法难以捕捉其细微特征。

Method: 采用阈值对比学习机制，结合余弦相似度和注意力模块，优化对比损失与交叉熵损失。

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上平均Macro F1提升9.86%至32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND能有效识别隐性性别歧视语言，减少误判。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合检索增强生成（RAG）、提示工程和跨模态注意力融合的AI框架，用于改进远程教育中的学生辍学预测，准确率达89%，并生成可解释的干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程教育中的学生辍学问题具有深远的社会和经济影响，传统机器学习模型难以捕捉非结构化互动中的情感和情境因素。

Method: 采用RAG增强的BERT模型进行情感分析，提示工程解码学业压力，跨模态注意力融合文本、行为和社会人口学数据。

Result: 在4,423名学生的数据集上，模型准确率达89%，F1分数0.88，优于传统模型7%，减少假阴性21%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了预测性能，还提供了可操作的干预策略，为全球教育系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

TL;DR: LCDS是一个逻辑控制的出院摘要生成系统，通过构建源映射表和逻辑规则，减少LLMs在生成出院摘要时的幻觉问题，并支持内容溯源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成出院摘要时的幻觉问题，以及难以将生成内容与电子病历（EMRs）长文本数据关联的挑战。

Method: LCDS通过计算EMRs与出院摘要的文本相似性构建源映射表，并结合逻辑规则生成可靠的摘要。

Result: LCDS能够生成更可靠的出院摘要，并支持内容溯源，便于专家审核和反馈。

Conclusion: LCDS有效减少了LLMs的幻觉问题，并提供了可溯源的摘要生成方案，为临床领域提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，长且连贯的推理痕迹能提升大语言模型的泛化能力，而非冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过优化推理痕迹（CoTs）提升大语言模型的推理能力，尤其是在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 使用分层图中的最短路径任务，训练解码器-变换器模型，比较基于动态规划的最优痕迹与低效但连贯的痕迹。

Result: 训练于低效但连贯痕迹的模型在未见图上表现更好，泛化能力与模型对下一标记预测的信心相关。

Conclusion: 长且连贯的推理痕迹有助于优化训练信号，提升模型泛化能力，而非单纯增加冗余计算。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

Result: EduCoder解决了教育对话标注的挑战，提高了数据可靠性，且系统为开源。

Conclusion: EduCoder为教育对话研究提供了高效、可靠的标注工具，填补了现有工具的不足。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InfoRidge框架，用于研究Transformer模型中任务相关信息在不同层级的流动，发现预测信息在中间层达到峰值（形成“泛化岭”），并揭示了中间层在泛化中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其内部机制如何合成任务相关信息尚不明确，尤其是中间层泛化能力的形成与传播机制。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论方法量化隐藏表示与目标输出之间的互信息，并引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针。

Result: 实验发现预测信息在中间层达到峰值（泛化岭），在分布偏移下模型更依赖这些层，表明其泛化能力。

Conclusion: 中间层在Transformer的泛化中起关键作用，InfoRidge为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业API访问大型语言模型（LLM）时用户需暴露数据，研究旨在让用户通过隐私配置文件控制数据隐私。

Method: 构建本地模型框架，使用隐私配置文件重写查询以隐藏敏感信息，引入PEEP数据集。

Result: 轻量级LLM能部分遵循隐私指令，但存在挑战，需改进模型对用户隐私偏好的理解。

Conclusion: 隐私配置文件是可行方案，但需进一步优化模型以更好地满足用户隐私需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

TL;DR: Omni-router Transformer通过共享路由器增强MoE层间的专家协作，显著降低ASR的词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法中，各层路由器独立选择专家，缺乏层间协作，限制了专家专业化。

Method: 提出共享路由器的Omni-router Transformer，增强层间专家协作与专业化。

Result: 在大规模数据集和10个多样化ASR基准测试中，词错误率分别降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: Omni-router Transformer在ASR任务中表现优于传统方法，提供更结构化的专家使用和更强的数据鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言任务中表现不佳，尤其是低资源语言，常默认用英语推理，影响准确性和可信度。

Method: 提出GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，确保推理与输入语言一致。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升多语言推理的准确性，证明语言一致性对跨语言泛化至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过语言一致性强化学习，可有效提升大模型在多语言任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何优先和整合上下文知识与参数知识，填补研究空白。

Method: 引入CoPE评估框架，使用MultiWikiAtomic数据集分析模型在开放问题回答中的表现，并设计基于提示的方法优化上下文利用。

Result: 发现模型存在‘later-in-the-lost’现象，CoT提示导致上下文利用减少，而CK-informed提示能提升事实基础和减少幻觉。

Conclusion: CoPE框架揭示了模型整合知识的局限性，提示设计可优化上下文利用，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

Result: 平均错误率不足以全面评估系统偏见，需补充其他指标。

Conclusion: 建议在报告ASR性能和偏见时采用更全面的指标，以更好地反映系统对不同说话者群体的表现和整体偏见。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

Method: 通过分析近1000万条X（原Twitter）上关于堕胎的帖子，结合用户性别、意识形态和地理位置数据。

Result: 性别显著调节堕胎态度和情感表达，尤其在保守地区；Dobbs案草案泄露进一步加剧了在线讨论，动员了支持堕胎的女性。

Conclusion: 堕胎讨论不仅受意识形态极化影响，还受性别和地域的深刻影响，突显身份在政治表达中的核心作用。

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

Result: PhoniTale表现与人工助记相当，短期记忆测试显示其有效性。

Conclusion: PhoniTale在助记生成方面具有潜力，未来需进一步提升助记质量和研究方法。

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Conclusion: LLMs的语义能力尚存争议，需进一步研究其是否真正理解语言。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling
for inclusive content moderation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

<details>

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理任务中性能不足的问题，同时避免依赖高级模型的蒸馏数据。

Method: 采用双级检索增强推理框架：粗粒度检索抽象模板，细粒度检索类似中间步骤，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和过程奖励模型优化推理。

Result: 在MATH500、GSM8K和OlympiadBench-TO数据集上，使用LLaMA-3.1-8B模型实现了高达16%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: R2-LLMs是一种高效的分层推理增强方法，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能，且无需依赖高级模型的蒸馏数据。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂指令遵循和数据成本方面存在不足，需要一种高效且质量保持的解决方案。

Method: Re5通过提取任务和约束组件、结构评估和选择性修订来实现精确改进。

Result: 实验显示Re5在少量数据下表现优异，64.24%的胜率优于未修订初始响应。

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且有效的解决方案，能以最小外部监督提升指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合小模型的领域专长和大模型的语义理解能力，解决传统知识蒸馏的局限性。

Method: 通过LoRA将LLM重新解释为编码器-解码器结构，编码器生成压缩表示，解码器映射到输出空间，使用MCL对齐相似性分数。

Result: 在金融和医疗基准测试及实际应用中验证了有效性，并已在线部署。

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏方法显著提升了LLM的性能，且仅需一个表现良好的SLM。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Motivation: 解决RAG中有效上下文长度受限和检索文档冗余的问题，同时避免压缩方法丢失关键细节。

Method: SARA采用两层次上下文表示：细粒度自然语言片段和紧凑语义压缩向量，结合动态重排模块优化上下文选择。

Result: 在9个数据集和5个开源LLM上，SARA显著提升了答案相关性（+17.71）、正确性（+13.72）和语义相似性（+15.53）。

Conclusion: SARA展示了结合文本和压缩表示对高效RAG的重要性，为上下文受限场景提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG
benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including
Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We
also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and

Result: 实验表明HIRAG在RGB、PopQA等数据集上显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: HIRAG通过分层思维指令微调有效解决了RAG模型的局限性，提升了其处理外部知识的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Conclusion: 通过合成对话数据增强预训练，可有效提升LLMs在多轮对话任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

Conclusion: LVLMs在模态补全任务中整体表现接近人类，但在特定语言和对象类别上存在不足。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究知识编辑评估方法的鲁棒性及其对模型能力的潜在破坏性影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较不同指标、评估方法和编辑批量大小对编辑器排名的影响，并结合人工评估字符串匹配方法的准确性。

Result: 发现不同评估方法和指标会导致编辑器排名变化，字符串匹配方法易产生假阳性匹配。

Conclusion: 评估知识编辑方法需更全面，避免依赖单一指标或方法，以减少偏差和假阳性。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了聊天系统中的“Ghosting”技术，即预测用户输入的自动补全功能，通过实验比较了多种方法，发现统计n-gram模型和trie在已知前缀上表现更优，而神经模型如T5和Phi-2在未知查询上效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ghosting技术在现代搜索和聊天系统中至关重要，但缺乏标准化基准和性能分析，尤其是在聊天场景中。

Method: 使用四种公开对话数据集，比较了trie、n-gram和深度学习方法，并提出了一种基于熵的动态早停策略。

Result: 统计n-gram和trie在已知前缀上表现更优，神经模型在未知查询上效果更好；对话上下文显著提升了Ghosting质量。

Conclusion: 研究填补了Ghosting领域的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

TL;DR: OpenFActScore是FActScore框架的开源实现，用于评估大语言模型生成文本的事实性，支持开源模型，性能接近闭源系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FActScore依赖闭源和商业模型的问题，提供透明、可复现且成本低的评估工具。

Method: 使用Atomic Fact Generation（AFG）提取事实声明，Atomic Fact Validation（AFV）验证声明，支持Hugging Face兼容模型。

Result: 开源模型（如Gemma）性能接近闭源系统，Pearson相关系数达0.99。

Conclusion: OpenFActScore提升了透明度和可复现性，为事实性评估提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLMs）及其安全分类器在低资源语言上表现不佳的问题，特别是在新加坡独特的语言环境中。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：（i）生成对抗性示例，（ii）半自动化多标签安全标注，（iii）高保真翻译。最终数据集包含5,000多个安全标注示例。

Result: 评估显示11种主流安全分类器在RabakBench上性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RabakBench为东南亚多语言环境提供了鲁棒的安全评估工具，并为低资源环境下的本地化安全数据集构建提供了可复现框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

Method: 1. 多级原则生成：大模型总结任务完成原则；2. 基于原则的实例生成：小模型生成数据用于训练。

Result: 显著提升模型性能，同时大幅减少碳排放。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且环保，适用于语言模型训练。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档级实体和关系抽取在零样本或少样本设置下高质量标注数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 结合合成数据生成与基于检索的上下文学习，使用推理优化的语言模型，无需人工标注即可构建高质量演示数据库。

Result: 生成了包含5k+维基百科摘要、59k实体和30k关系三元组的合成数据集，并在DocIE共享任务中评估了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 文档级实体和关系的上下文联合抽取对最先进的大语言模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了具身智能体的任务执行能力，证明了多阶段失败恢复的有效性。

Abstract: Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution
failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In
this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

Result: 发现数据熵与记忆分数线性相关，随机字符串的熵低于预期，并开发了数据集推断方法。

Conclusion: 熵-记忆定律为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，数据集推断方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

Method: NeoBabel结合大规模多语言预训练和高分辨率指令调优，支持六种语言。扩展了两个多语言基准测试（m-GenEval和m-DPG）进行评估。

Result: NeoBabel在多语言基准测试中表现优异（m-GenEval得分0.75，m-DPG得分0.68），优于其他多语言模型，同时模型更小（2-4倍）。

Conclusion: 多语言能力不是性能的妥协，而是提升生成AI鲁棒性、效率和文化保真度的催化剂。开源工具包促进包容性AI研究。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型认知的局限性和改进潜力，为开发更强大的代码生成模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Conclusion: Skywork-R1V3在多模态推理中取得显著突破，强化学习是提升开源视觉语言模型能力的有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注代码生成和编译，而忽视了批评阶段的重要性，即评估形式化是否真正反映原始问题的语义意图。

Method: 提出CriticLeanGPT，通过监督微调和强化学习训练，评估Lean 4形式化的语义保真度，并构建CriticLeanBench基准和FineLeanCorpus数据集。

Conclusion: 优化批评阶段对生成可靠形式化至关重要，CriticLean为形式数学推理的未来发展提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

### [93] [DS@GT at CheckThat! 2025: Evaluating Context and Tokenization Strategies for Numerical Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06195)
*Maximilian Heil,Aleksandar Pramov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了数值声明验证的建模策略，发现右到左标记化和长上下文窗口对性能无显著提升，证据质量是关键瓶颈。最佳系统在CheckThat! 2025任务3中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数值声明在自动事实核查系统中具有独特挑战，需探索有效的建模策略。

Method: 使用QuanTemp数据集和自定义证据检索管道，评估ModernBERT、右到左标记化和长上下文窗口的影响。

Result: 右到左标记化和长上下文窗口未显著提升性能，证据质量是主要瓶颈。最佳系统F1得分为0.57，排名Top-4。

Conclusion: 证据质量是数值声明验证的关键，未来研究需优化证据检索而非标记化或上下文窗口。

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

TL;DR: 该论文综述了潜在推理（latent reasoning）的研究进展，探讨了其在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的应用，旨在解决显式链式思维（CoT）推理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式链式思维推理（CoT）虽然提高了模型的可解释性和准确性，但其依赖自然语言推理限制了模型的表达能力。潜在推理通过完全在模型的连续隐藏状态中进行多步推理，解决了这一瓶颈。

Method: 论文首先探讨了神经网络层作为推理计算基础的作用，接着分析了多种潜在推理方法，包括基于激活的递归、隐藏状态传播和微调策略，最后讨论了高级范式如无限深度潜在推理。

Result: 通过整合这些视角，论文明确了潜在推理的概念框架，并为其未来研究方向提供了指导。

Conclusion: 潜在推理为LLM认知研究开辟了新方向，有望进一步提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

*Zhiyuan Peng,Ting-ruen Wei,Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了E²R-FLOPs指标，用于评估LLM在信息检索中的效率与效果权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM重排效率的指标依赖硬件和运行时选择，难以衡量模型大小的影响，导致效率与效果权衡评估不清晰。

Method: 提出E²R-FLOPs指标（RPP和QPP），并构建可解释的FLOPs估计器，无需实验即可估算FLOPs。

Result: 通过实验评估多种LLM重排架构，分析效率与效果的关系。

Conclusion: 新指标为研究社区提供了更清晰的效率与效果权衡评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

TL;DR: Agent KB是一个分层经验框架，通过Reason-Retrieve-Refine流程解决语言代理在复杂任务中的错误修正和经验复用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代理无法从彼此的经验中学习，限制了跨领域问题解决能力。

Method: 采用分层框架，结合高层策略和详细执行日志，构建共享知识库。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，成功率提升16.28%；Claude-3和GPT-4在特定任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: Agent KB为代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，支持经验学习和策略泛化。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdaptaGen框架，通过分层语义优化和跨模态适应机制，解决领域特定图像生成中的语义偏差和幻觉问题，显著提升图像质量、多样性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理领域特定图像生成时，未能充分结合语义理解与视觉表示，且缺乏对领域特定语义约束的考虑，导致生成结果出现幻觉和语义偏差。

Method: 提出AdaptaGen框架，包括矩阵提示优化、多视角语义理解、跨模态适应机制和两阶段标题语义转换，以优化生成过程。

Result: 在40个类别的数据集上，仅需每类16张图像，AdaptaGen在图像质量、多样性和语义一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaptaGen通过分层语义优化和跨模态适应机制，有效解决了领域特定图像生成中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为D-FCGS的馈送压缩框架，用于动态高斯点云序列的高效压缩，无需逐场景优化，实现了40倍以上的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D高斯点云的高效压缩是自由视点视频（FVV）的关键挑战，现有方法依赖优化且泛化性差。

Method: 采用Group-of-Frames结构和I-P帧编码，通过稀疏控制点提取帧间运动，并利用双先验熵模型压缩运动张量。

Result: 实验表明，D-FCGS在保持视觉质量的同时，实现了40倍以上的压缩，且处理时间短于2秒。

Conclusion: D-FCGS为动态3D高斯点云的馈送压缩提供了高效解决方案，推动了FVV的可扩展传输与存储。

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

TL;DR: 通过结构化标注改进生成模型的文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式文本-图像模型在大型数据集（如LAION-5B）上因标注噪声和无结构性问题导致提示词难以控制，需依赖复杂的提示工程。

Method: 提出Re-LAION-Caption 19M数据集，标注采用四部分结构（主题、场景、美学、相机细节），并基于此微调PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2模型。

Result: 结构化标注版本在视觉问答（VQA）模型中显示出更高的文本-图像对齐分数。

Conclusion: 结构化标注显著提升模型可控性和对齐能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: MEDTalk是一个用于生成细粒度和动态情感3D面部动画的新框架，通过解耦内容和情感嵌入空间，结合音频和文本输入，实现更自然和多样化的面部表情。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多基于静态和预定义的情感标签，限制了面部动画的多样性和自然性。MEDTalk旨在解决这一问题，提供更动态和个性化的情感表达。

Method: 通过跨重建过程解耦内容和情感嵌入空间，结合音频和文本输入预测帧级强度变化，动态调整静态情感特征，并引入多模态输入（如文本描述和参考图像）增强控制。

Result: 生成的3D面部动画具有更高的自然性和多样性，并能无缝集成到工业生产线中（如MetaHuman）。

Conclusion: MEDTalk通过动态情感调整和多模态输入，显著提升了情感3D面部动画的质量和控制灵活性。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，人脸深度伪造对安全领域构成重大挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。现有方法存在解释性不足或易产生幻觉的问题。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，通过错误引导问题校正真实伪造细节，并引入视觉细粒度细节增强模块，结合融合决策策略提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，CorrDetail在性能上优于最新方法，能准确识别伪造细节，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail为解决深度伪造检测问题提供了一种高效且可解释的方案。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception systems require robust pedestrian detection,
particularly on geometrically complex roadways like Type-S curved surfaces,
where standard RGB camera-based methods face limitations. This paper introduces
YOLO-APD, a novel deep learning architecture enhancing the YOLOv8 framework
specifically for this challenge. YOLO-APD integrates several key architectural
modifications: a parameter-free SimAM attention mechanism, computationally
efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,
efficient, and adaptable perception systems based on cost-effective sensors,
contributing to enhanced safety and reliability for autonomous navigation in
challenging, less-structured driving environments.

TL;DR: Spotlight是一种虚拟染色方法，通过引导模型关注相关细胞结构，改进了形态学表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟染色方法在训练时对所有像素平等处理，导致背景噪声和伪影被复制，而非聚焦于有生物学意义的信号。

Method: Spotlight使用基于直方图的前景估计来掩蔽像素级损失，并在软阈值预测上计算Dice损失以实现形状感知学习。

Result: 在3D基准数据集上，Spotlight改进了形态学表示，同时保持了像素级精度，生成的虚拟染色更适合下游任务。

Conclusion: Spotlight是一种简单而强大的虚拟染色方法，能更好地服务于下游分析任务。

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware
learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological
representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual
stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.

Conclusion: 农业领域需要专门的基础模型（CropFM）以更高效地解决作物类型映射、物候估计和产量估算等任务。

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare

evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model

Conclusion: 结合人类主观评估的深度学习方法能有效提升海底图像质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

TL;DR: pFedMMA是一种个性化的联邦学习框架，利用多模态适配器解决视觉语言任务中的泛化与个性化平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在个性化联邦学习中常牺牲泛化能力，难以处理未见类别或领域。

Method: 采用多模态适配器，包含模态特定的上下投影层和全局共享投影层，通过非对称优化策略实现本地个性化与全局泛化的平衡。

Result: 在11个数据集上验证，pFedMMA在个性化与泛化之间取得了最佳平衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: pFedMMA为视觉语言任务提供了一种高效且通信友好的个性化联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

Motivation: 传统图像编辑依赖手动提示，对运动或语言能力有限的人不友好，因此提出基于神经信号的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散模型和多模态神经信号（EEG、fNIRS等），通过CS3和DGF模块处理信号，并与DiT对齐。

Result: 性能接近文本驱动方法（CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558），结合语音时表现更优（CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549）。

Conclusion: 神经驱动的生成模型为无障碍图像编辑提供了新方向，推动了认知驱动技术的发展。

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

Abstract: Motion generation, the task of synthesizing realistic motion sequences from
various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于2D扩散编辑和逆渲染的3D场景局部编辑方法，解决了3D语义解析性能不足的问题，实现了高效且精确的区域编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D场景编辑通常需要对局部区域进行精确修改，但3D语义解析性能较差，限制了编辑的精确性和效率。

Method: 利用2D扩散编辑识别修改区域，通过逆渲染进行3D定位，结合深度图预测初始化粗粒度3D高斯分布，并通过迭代优化提升细节和纹理一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上达到最优，同时实现了4倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景局部编辑提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Conclusion: 该研究有助于早期检测认知衰退，开发可扩展、非侵入的监测系统，减轻老龄化社会中认知衰退的社会和经济负担。

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型使用白噪声，而自然图像具有尺度不变性，因此提出使用尺度不变噪声以更好地匹配自然图像的统计特性。

Method: 在扩散模型中引入尺度不变噪声，替代传统的白噪声，形成Cloud Diffusion Model。

Result: 预计该模型能实现更快的推理速度、更优的高频细节和更强的可控性。

Conclusion: Cloud Diffusion Model有望在图像生成任务中超越传统白噪声扩散模型，后续将进行实验验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像生成多视图图像时空间一致性不足的问题，以提升3D网格重建质量。

Method: 使用多视图扩散模型并行生成假设，通过正交平面投影和融合编码，最终生成一致的多视图图像。

Result: LoomNet在15秒内生成16个高质量且一致的多视图图像，在图像质量和重建指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LoomNet通过共享潜在空间和多视图协同生成，显著提升了多视图图像的一致性和多样性。

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional

fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的布局生成方法未能充分理解视觉主题与设计元素间的空间关系，导致生成布局结构不合理且缺乏多样性。

Method: 引入明确的关系定义（如区域、显著性和边距）分解布局，并设计布局原型重平衡采样器以量化不同布局风格。

Result: 实验表明，ReLayout优于基线方法，能生成更符合人类审美且可解释的结构化多样化布局。

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系链式思维和原型重平衡，显著提升了布局生成的结构性和多样性。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

<details>

Motivation: 多模态FAS中，不同模态的数据分布差异大，且模态缺失时性能下降。活体样本的跨模态特征转换更一致，而欺骗样本则不一致。

Method: CTNet通过学习活体样本的跨模态一致性特征转换构建通用特征空间，并利用不一致性检测欺骗攻击。同时，从RGB模态学习补充IR和深度特征以应对模态缺失。

Result: 实验表明，CTNet在大多数协议中优于现有的多模态FAS方法。

Conclusion: CTNet通过跨模态特征转换和模态补充学习，有效提升了多模态FAS的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

*Zhizhuo Pang,Zhihui Ke,Xiaobo Zhou,Tie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSVR提出了一种基于2D高斯的视频表示方法，显著提升了解码速度和训练效率，同时保持了高质量的视频重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于卷积网络的视频表示方法解码速度慢且训练时间长，GSVR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: GSVR结合了混合变形场、动态感知时间切片策略和量化感知微调技术。

Result: 在Bunny和UVG数据集上，GSVR实现了800+ FPS的解码速度和35+ PSNR，训练时间仅为2秒/帧。

Conclusion: GSVR在视频重建、解码速度和训练效率上均优于现有方法，适用于视频插值和压缩任务。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: Accordion是一个将AI生成的平面设计转换为可编辑分层设计的框架，通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和用户提示优化文本内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的设计通常缺乏可编辑性，但能启发设计师的布局和文本风格选择。Accordion旨在解决这一问题，将非分层设计转换为可编辑的分层设计。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型（VLM）分三个阶段执行任务，结合SAM和元素移除模型等视觉专家工具，以自上而下的方式分解图层。

Result: 在DesignIntention基准测试中表现优异，支持文本到模板、背景添加文本和文本去渲染等任务，并能生成设计变体。

Conclusion: Accordion为设计师提供了一种高效的工具，将AI生成的设计转换为可编辑的分层设计，同时优化文本内容。

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

TL;DR: Kernel Density Steering (KDS) 是一种新的推理时框架，通过显式局部模式搜索提升扩散模型在图像修复中的鲁棒性和高保真输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像修复中常出现保真度不一致和不良伪影问题，KDS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: KDS采用N粒子扩散样本集合，计算其输出的局部核密度估计梯度，引导样本向高密度区域移动，避免伪影。

Result: KDS显著提升了超分辨率和图像修复任务的定量和定性性能。

Conclusion: KDS作为一种即插即用框架，无需重新训练或外部验证器，可无缝集成到多种扩散采样器中，提供更高质量的样本。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 由于难以获取面部状态的真实数据，且现有方法依赖昂贵的配对数据采集，限制了大规模数据集的构建和重用。

Method: GenHMC利用大量未配对的HMC数据，通过生成模型直接合成高质量的HMC图像，并解耦面部表情和外观。

Result: 方法能够生成更准确的真实数据，并泛化到未见过的身份，提升了数据效率和准确性。

Conclusion: GenHMC为VR/AR中的虚拟化身动画提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于焦点映射的特征提取器（OFFSET），用于解决组合图像检索（CIR）中的视觉数据不均匀性和文本数据优先级问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法忽略了视觉数据中主导部分与噪声部分的不均匀性，以及文本数据在图像修改过程中的优先级，导致查询特征退化和视觉焦点偏差。

Method: 提出OFFSET网络，包含主导部分分割和双重焦点映射模块，以及文本引导的焦点修正模块，以减少噪声干扰并增强修改焦点的感知。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验验证了OFFSET的优越性。

Conclusion: OFFSET通过改进特征提取和焦点修正，显著提升了组合图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The
codes and data are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/OFFSET.github.io/

Motivation: 传统实值扩散模型在PolSAR数据中难以捕捉复杂相位信息且难以保留精细结构细节。

Method: 利用Contourlet变换分解数据为低高频子带，设计知识引导的复杂扩散网络建模低频统计特性，并利用高频结构信息指导扩散过程。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在边缘细节保留和复杂地形区域同质性方面。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了PolSAR图像分类性能，特别是在复杂地形中。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示和适配器的方法在微调视觉语言模型时，难以平衡泛化能力和新类别识别，主要因为对所有特征平等处理导致过拟合。

Result: 实验表明DRA在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，显著提升新类别性能。

Conclusion: DRA通过动态特征重要性分配，有效提升模型对新类别的泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

Result: 在实验室收集的多样化光照条件下数据集上验证了方法的有效性，支持事件传感器在姿态估计中的应用。

Conclusion: RGB与事件传感器融合方法有效，数据集将公开以促进社区研究。

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further

Conclusion: ISP通过结构化的提示设计和动态样本调整，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法在控制相机轨迹和物体运动时存在不稳定融合和非线性可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出LiON-LoRA框架，分析LoRA特征的正交性，强制范数一致性，并引入可控令牌到扩散变换器中。

Result: 实验显示LiON-LoRA在轨迹控制精度和运动强度调整上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA在少量训练数据下实现了优越的泛化能力和控制精度。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

*Yegyu Han,Taegyoon Yoon,Dayeon Woo,Sojeong Kim,Hyung-Sin Kim*

TL;DR: SenseShift6D是一个新的RGB-D数据集，用于研究传感器控制和光照变化对6D物体姿态估计的影响，实验表明传感器控制能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集在固定光照和传感器设置下采集，缺乏对真实世界中光照和传感器变化的探索。SenseShift6D旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过物理调整13种RGB曝光、9种RGB增益、自动曝光、4种深度模式和5种光照水平，采集101.9k RGB和10k深度图像，生成1,380种传感器-光照组合。

Result: 实验显示，测试时传感器控制比数据增强更有效，性能提升显著，尤其是多模态RGB-D联合调整。

Conclusion: SenseShift6D为6D姿态估计引入了传感器感知的鲁棒性评估，为自适应感知系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

Conclusion: 该自动白平衡算法在显微图像处理中具有更高的有效性。

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注表面几何和纹理，忽略了部件分解和铰接建模，且依赖密集多视图或交互数据，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 重建部件分割的完整3D网格；2) 利用视频扩散模型捕捉部件级铰接先验；3) 优化铰接运动并进行全局纹理细化。

Result: 实验表明，DreamArt能生成高质量铰接物体，具有准确的部件形状、高保真外观和合理的铰接。

Conclusion: DreamArt为铰接物体生成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

Conclusion: TalkFashion提升了虚拟试穿的灵活性和自动化程度。

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the
current methods.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练视觉语言模型的方法在空间关系推理上存在局限，导致关系预测效果不佳。

Method: SPADE框架包括反演引导的UNet校准和空间感知上下文推理两步，利用LoRA微调和图变换器优化关系查询生成。

Result: 在PSG和Visual Genome数据集上，SPADE在封闭和开放场景中均优于现有方法，尤其在空间关系预测上表现突出。

Conclusion: SPADE通过空间感知设计有效解决了PSG任务中关系预测的挑战，为复杂场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在一致性和对象身份保持上优于现有2D编辑方法（如DragGAN和DragDiffusion）。

Conclusion: 该框架为2D图像编辑提供了一种更一致且物理可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,
human-computer interaction, and beyond.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Method: 提出USIGAN方法，结合不平衡自信息特征传输、UOT-CTM机制和PC-SCM机制，优化联合分布并提取全局形态语义。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在IoD和Pearson-R等临床指标上表现优异，具有更好的临床相关性。

Conclusion: USIGAN方法有效解决了弱配对条件下的病理语义一致性问题，为病理分析提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

*Xianzhi Ma,Jianhui Li,Changhua Pei,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMag是一个端到端的通用大模型框架，通过动态调整注意力范围和分辨率，提升遥感图像多粒度解析能力，同时减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言模型（RS-VLMs）在像素级任务和小目标识别上表现不佳，且处理高分辨率图像时计算资源消耗大。

Method: 引入任务驱动的多粒度分辨率调整（TMRA）和提示引导的语义感知裁剪（PSC），动态优化任务相关区域的视觉表示。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，GeoMag在像素级任务上表现优异，同时在其他粒度任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GeoMag显著提升了遥感图像解析的效率和性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态数据不完整的情况下表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

Method: 方法学和实验分析了五类十种解释指标，应用于五种特征归因方法，并在三个RS数据集上进行验证。

Result: 发现扰动和梯度方法在RS场景中存在局限性，而鲁棒性和随机化指标表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 提供了RS图像场景分类中选择解释方法、指标和超参数的指南。

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MGPO的强化学习框架，通过多轮对话自动裁剪关键视觉区域，解决了大模型处理高分辨率图像时视觉令牌过多的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）在处理高分辨率图像时，会生成大量无关视觉令牌，影响性能。需要一种无需额外标注的方法来提升模型对关键区域的关注能力。

Method: 提出MGPO框架，通过强化学习在多轮对话中自动裁剪子图像，利用二元奖励函数（基于答案正确性）训练模型，并设计多轮对话模板解决冷启动问题。

Result: 实验表明，MGPO在无标注数据上训练后，性能优于GRPO，在MME-Realworld和V* Bench上分别提升5.4%和5.2%，并在OOD任务上超越OpenAI的o1和GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MGPO通过强化学习有效提升了LMMs的视觉定位能力，无需额外标注，且在多任务中表现优异。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

Motivation: 视频实例分割面临遮挡、运动模糊和外观变化等挑战，需引入几何感知（如深度估计）提升鲁棒性。

Method: 研究了三种深度集成方法：EDC（扩展深度通道）、SV（共享ViT骨干）和DS（深度监督），其中EDC和SV效果显著。

Result: EDC方法在Swin-L骨干网上达到56.2 AP，创下OVIS基准的新纪录。

Conclusion: 深度信息是提升视频理解鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏表示方法，通过两阶段策略提高神经表面重建的分辨率和效率，显著减少存储需求并提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集3D特征体积在全局场景表示中有效，但分辨率提升时内存效率低，限制了重建质量。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：先预测体素占用率，再在占用率高的体素中进行特征计算和体积渲染，并开发了稀疏体积的高效采样和查询算法。

Result: 存储需求减少50倍以上，支持512^3分辨率（通常为128^3），重建精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示方法显著提升了神经表面重建的分辨率和效率，适用于标准硬件。

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

Conclusion: T-LoRA在单图像定制中表现出色，平衡了概念保真度和文本对齐，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的流程和框架有效解决了CIR任务中的标注瓶颈问题，展示了合成数据的潜力。

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: SCINet通过语义共现洞察和多模态融合，有效解决了部分多标签学习中的模糊关系问题，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery

Motivation: 在GNSS信号缺失的密集城市区域，现有方法依赖实时GNSS和IMU数据，但易因信号不稳定导致定位误差。

Method: 使用预训练的点Transformer模型分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点进行全局刚性对齐，再通过RBF插值局部优化，并基于SRTM数据进行高程校正。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖先验定位信息，能有效恢复GNSS信息并重建城市尺度3D地图，适用于复杂城市环境。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Method: VisualSpeaker利用光真实感3D高斯泼溅渲染和预训练的视觉自动语音识别模型，引入感知唇读损失函数。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上，VisualSpeaker将Lip Vertex Error指标提升了56.1%，同时保持了网格驱动动画的可控性。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Conclusion: MCAM在自动驾驶应用中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最优效果，首次支持通用中央相机模型。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了法线积分精度和适用性。

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

*Chihan Huang,Hao Tang*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

Conclusion: CAST-Phys数据集为远程生理情绪识别提供了重要资源，多模态融合方法推动了非接触式情绪识别技术的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

Result: Ref-Unlock显著优于传统GS方法，与NeRF模型竞争，并支持灵活的反射编辑。

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock为反射场景的逼真渲染提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code
is available at https://ref-unlock.github.io/.

Conclusion: Omni-Video为统一视频建模提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了多目标图像生成中的偏差和多样性问题，显著提升了数据增强的效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

Method: 引入一类基于相似性或邻接矩阵的平滑算子，通过对称Sinkhorn算法归一化，使其具有Laplacian的热扩散特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为不规则数据提供了Laplacian-like的平滑和处理能力，扩展了形状分析和匹配的应用。

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art
performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D

Conclusion: 提示优化、链式推理和集成建模能有效提升视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble
modeling in improving the model's ability in visual question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在多模态理解中表现优异，但在区分视觉相似但文化背景不同的概念时存在困难，主要由于缺乏高质量文化数据集和上下文知识。

Method: 设计了数据生成流程，利用开源VLM和文本到图像扩散模型构建CulTwin数据集，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP，创建CultureCLIP模型。

Result: 在文化相关基准测试中，CultureCLIP比基础CLIP性能提升高达5.49%，同时保留了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过数据合成和模型训练，CultureCLIP能有效捕捉细微文化差异，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

Conclusion: SceneDINO为单图像3D场景理解提供了强大的基础，展示了领域泛化和多视角一致性。

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex
semantic interpretation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: AnthroTAP提出了一种自动化生成伪标签训练数据的流程，利用SMPL模型解决人类运动点跟踪数据标注困难的问题，显著提升了点跟踪模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动数据复杂且标注困难，限制了点跟踪模型的训练数据获取。

Method: 使用SMPL模型拟合视频中的人体，生成2D伪轨迹，处理遮挡并过滤不可靠轨迹。

Result: 在TAP-Vid基准测试中达到SOTA性能，数据量和计算资源需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: AnthroTAP为点跟踪任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GNN深度增加，过平滑问题导致节点表征失去独特性，需深入理解其机制并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过类比安德森局域化，分析GNN中过平滑现象，提出参与度作为量化指标，并进行理论分析。

Result: 过平滑可理解为低频模式扩展和高频模式局域化，减少信息传播无序性可能缓解过平滑。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了GNN过平滑与安德森局域化的联系，为缓解过平滑提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

Conclusion: 该方法为时间序列预测中外生输入的使用提供了鲁棒且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Motivation: DNN在任务中表现优异但计算和内存成本高，XAI可用于理解DNN内部机制，结合压缩技术以适配资源受限设备。

Method: 使用层间相关性传播（LRP）计算权重重要性评分，剪除负或零重要性参数，并对权重进行混合精度量化。

Result: 模型大小减少64%，精度提升42%，优于现有XAI压缩方法。

Conclusion: XAI驱动的压缩方法高效且对精度影响小，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Conclusion: P-DivGNN是一种高效且物理约束的局部应力场重建方法，适用于多尺度模拟。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping

NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Conclusion: 该方法为RCPSP提供了一种新的无数据神经网络解决方案，有望提升计算效率。

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

Method: 提出HEPO框架，以最大化策略改进为目标，避免奖励滥用，有效利用启发式奖励。

Result: HEPO在标准基准测试中表现优异，即使启发式奖励设计不佳也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: HEPO为强化学习中的启发式奖励利用提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Conclusion: 模型支持基础模型的关键能力（如少样本泛化），并强调了在表示学习中编码因果结构的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Result: RFT能保留先验知识并提升通用能力，而SFT导致灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练的鲁棒范式，提出基于rollout的实例过滤算法优化RFT。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear

verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that

unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware

infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业排放对空气质量和公共健康的影响常被忽视，传统物理模型在捕捉复杂非线性污染物交互方面存在不足。

### [194] [Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks on Financial Reporting via Maximum Violated Multi-Objective Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05441)
*Edward Raff,Karen Kukla,Michel Benaroch,Joseph Comprix*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MVMO的攻击方法，用于帮助财务困境公司操纵财务报告，实现收益虚增和欺诈评分降低的双重目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务困境公司有动机通过操纵财务报告隐藏困境并获取个人利益，现有攻击方法无法满足其双重目标。

Method: 引入MVMO攻击方法，调整攻击方向以找到更多满足条件的攻击方案。

Result: 在约50%的情况下，公司可将收益虚增100-200%，同时欺诈评分降低15%。

Conclusion: MVMO攻击方法在实际中具有可行性，通过与律师和专业会计师合作验证了其威胁模型的真实性。

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

### [195] [2048: Reinforcement Learning in a Delayed Reward Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05465)
*Prady Saligram,Tanvir Bhathal,Robby Manihani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的分布多步强化学习框架，用于优化长期性能，并在2048游戏中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 延迟和稀疏奖励是强化学习中的主要障碍，现有方法难以在长期收益中分配信用。2048游戏体现了这一挑战。

Method: 开发了四种代理变体：标准DQN、PPO、QR-DQN和新型H-DQN，结合了分布学习、决斗架构等技术。

Result: H-DQN表现最佳，最高得分达41.828K并达到4096方块，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 分布多步目标显著提升了稀疏奖励领域的性能，未来可通过模型规划和课程学习进一步改进。

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于前向-后向表示（FB）的探索策略，用于零样本强化学习，以最小化FB表示的后验方差，从而提升学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本强化学习在缺乏具体奖励的情况下需要快速适应未来问题设置，而现有的FB方法通常依赖其他探索算法进行数据收集。

Method: 设计了一种基于FB表示的探索策略，通过最小化FB表示的后验方差来减少其认知不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，这种探索策略显著提高了FB算法的样本效率。

Conclusion: FB表示应直接用于探索，以提升零样本强化学习的效率。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

*Andrew Jacobsen,Alessandro Rudi,Francesco Orabona,Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，利用RKHS框架，实现了在线凸优化中的动态遗憾最小化，并提供了新的无尺度和方向自适应的动态遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线凸优化中的动态遗憾问题，旨在通过函数空间的方法，提供更优的动态遗憾保证，并扩展其适用范围。

Method: 将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，利用RKHS构造合适的函数空间，适用于线性损失和其他类型的损失序列。

Result: 在线性损失下恢复了最优动态遗憾保证，并在exp-concave和非适当线性回归设置中提供了新的遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 通过RKHS框架，论文不仅扩展了动态遗憾问题的适用范围，还提供了实际可计算的算法。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

### [198] [Navigating Sparse Molecular Data with Stein Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05482)
*Van Khoa Nguyen,Lionel Blondé,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的无训练扩散引导框架（SDG），通过结合随机最优控制（SOC）和近似后验校正，显著提升了扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机最优控制（SOC）在扩散模型微调中表现优异，但计算成本高；而现有的无训练方法虽然快速，但近似后验误差大，导致引导不可靠。

Method: 提出Stein Diffusion Guidance（SDG），结合SOC和Stein变分推断，校正近似后验，并引入新的运行成本函数。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，SDG显著优于标准无训练引导方法。

Conclusion: SDG通过理论驱动的校正机制，为扩散模型提供了高效可靠的引导，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Conclusion: Ex-HiDeNN在发现闭式表达式方面具有潜力，但仍存在局限，未来可进一步扩展。

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

Conclusion: 集成GCLSTM模型在预测建筑流量方面具有显著优势，为动态时间分辨率下的流量预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour
or preferences while maintaining individual privacy. We formulate the problem
as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi
Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Linear Regression.

Conclusion: MLMC方案成功结合了有偏和无偏压缩器的优点，提升了通信效率。

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

Abstract: User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize
costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel
treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By
leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to
optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while
minimizing costs. Unlike traditional prediction methods, our model directly
models uplifts in key business metrics. Further, our deep learning model can
jointly optimize parameters for an aggregated loss function using softmax
gating. Our approach surpasses traditional methods by directly targeting
desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including
comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques such as R-learner and Causal
Forest, validate the effectiveness of our model. We experimentally demonstrate
that our proposed constrained and direct optimization algorithms significantly

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习框架，用于处理多因素异质处理效应（HTE）的估计和排序问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着HTE估计在科学和工业应用中的普及，处理动作空间从二元扩展到结构化策略，需要新的方法来整合多因素处理政策。

Result: 提出的方法在公共数据集上展示了性能提升，能够有效排序和处理多因素HTE。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习异质处理政策提供了通用解决方案，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

Result: MACE-TNP在实验中优于强贝叶斯基线方法。

Conclusion: 元学习为复杂贝叶斯因果推断提供了一种灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterpoLL通过插值学习削弱捷径影响，提升模型在少数样本上的泛化能力，同时不影响多数样本的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERM方法依赖训练数据中的捷径（虚假相关性），导致模型在少数样本上泛化能力差。现有方法存在模型特定性、调参困难等问题。

Method: 提出InterpoLL，通过插值多数样本的表征以包含少数样本的特征，从而削弱捷径影响。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解任务中，InterpoLL优于ERM和现有方法，提升少数样本泛化能力，且不影响多数样本准确性。

Conclusion: InterpoLL具有广泛适用性，适用于多种架构，为捷径问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对图神经网络（GNNs）的硬件故障攻击方法GBFA，通过逐层翻转权重参数中的比特位，显著降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GNNs在图形数据上表现出色，但其硬件加速器的安全性问题被忽视。本文旨在研究GNNs对硬件故障攻击的脆弱性。

Method: GBFA采用两步策略：1）基于马尔可夫模型预测层执行顺序；2）通过梯度排序识别脆弱比特位。

Result: 实验表明，GBFA仅需翻转少量比特即可显著降低GNNs的预测准确性，例如在Cora数据集上使GraphSAGE的准确率下降17%。

Conclusion: GBFA揭示了GNNs对硬件攻击的脆弱性，强调了层感知攻击策略的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Conclusion: 图稀疏化在保留关键边时维持泛化性能，跳跃连接导致不同层的稀疏化需求不同。

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Motivation: 现有方法直接从负载步态映射到手负载，限制了泛化能力和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架无需推理时携带风格标签，通过辅助信息和融合机制提升了负载估计性能。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“多任务预演”的新算法，通过利用已完成任务的经验来预学习未完成任务的可能解决方案，从而提升任务适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通常只能同时处理少量任务，但可以通过经验预学习未完成任务的可能解决方案。本文旨在形式化这一能力，并开发一种算法来模拟这一过程。

Method: 提出了“多任务预演”算法，通过重放已完成任务的经验作为起点，模拟未完成任务的可能解决方案，学习预测性表征以支持快速任务适应。

Result: 实验表明，多任务预演在网格世界和部分可观测的2D Minecraft环境中均能更好地预测人类的任务泛化能力，并显著提升人工代理在复杂多任务环境中的性能。

Conclusion: 多任务预演是一种可扩展的理论，能够解释人类如何通过反事实学习在多任务中泛化，同时显著提升人工代理在多任务环境中的表现。

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Motivation: 探讨两种方法在运动模仿和任务适应性上的优缺点，为方法选择提供依据。

Method: 对比特征方法（密集可解释奖励）和GAN方法（隐式分布监督），分析其适用场景。

Result: 特征方法适合高保真模仿，GAN方法更灵活但训练不稳定；结构化运动表示是关键。

Conclusion: 方法选择应基于任务需求（保真度、多样性等），而非范式优劣。

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Motivation: 现有方法（如域随机化和离线RL）需要直接与目标域交互，存在安全隐患。UARL旨在解决这一问题，确保训练安全。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准和四足机器人上，UARL表现出可靠的OOD检测能力、性能提升和样本效率改进。

Conclusion: UARL在不直接训练于目标域的情况下，实现了鲁棒的泛化能力，为安全RL部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种任务（如能量聚焦、全息图像生成等）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需系统建模，可直接应用于物理系统，为复杂光学系统提供了一种可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that
integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based
neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary
differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate
training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the
spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional
Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting
future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data,
bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex
dynamical systems.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We
also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure
responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and
discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and
other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey
serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to
navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

Result: 实验验证了FACT定理的有效性，FACT-RFM在表格数据上表现优异，并能模拟神经网络训练中的特征学习行为（如模块算术中的“grokking”和稀疏奇偶性的相变）。

Conclusion: FACT定理为理解神经网络的特征学习提供了理论工具，FACT-RFM算法展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Result: 在TritonBench和KernelBench上表现优异，接近Claude-4-Sonnet等主流模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习可自动生成高性能内核，为高效AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible

insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to

UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效预测动态图结构，适用于顶点变化场景。

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Result: 评估显示，现有LLMs在物理推理尤其是动态变体泛化上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs的科学推理能力提供了具有挑战性和诊断性的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决少样本领域适应中因缺乏大型验证数据集而难以调优超参数的问题，以及模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 训练多个独立的适配器并平均其输出，将结果重新参数化为单一适配器（Soup-Adapter）。

Result: 新模型性能更高，对分布偏移更鲁棒，且对关键超参数（如残差比例）不敏感。

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter方法有效解决了少样本领域适应中的两个核心问题，并首次探索了DINOv2的适配器技术及其与CLIP的比较。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Conclusion: BAGEL框架为深度学习模型的全局解释提供了可扩展且模型无关的工具，有助于理解模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Method: 通过信息论视角推导上界，设计PAFDG框架，利用帕累托优化权衡效用与公平性。

Result: 在真实数据集上，PAFDG在效用与公平性权衡上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAFDG为领域泛化与公平性结合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into
the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for
transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while
also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data

outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Method: D2C框架分为两个阶段：Select（选择紧凑多样的子集）和Attach（增强子集的语义和视觉表示）。

Result: 实验表明，D2C能显著减少训练数据量（仅需0.8%数据）并加速训练（100倍），同时保持高质量生成效果（FID 4.3）。

Conclusion: D2C为扩散模型的高效训练提供了可行的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart

Motivation: 尽管Adam在深度神经网络训练中表现出色，但其理论收敛分析仍不完善。现有方法需要强假设和复杂技术，导致证明冗长且难以验证。

Method: 将Adam重新解释为类似符号的优化器，形式化为$x_{t+1} = x_t - \gamma_t \frac{|m_t|}{{\sqrt{v_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(m_t)$。

Result: 在广义p-仿射方差和(L0, L1, q)-平滑性的弱假设下，首次证明了Adam的最优收敛速率为${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$。

Conclusion: 新解释简化了收敛分析，揭示了动量在确保收敛中的关键作用，并为Adam学习率调优提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维低样本量（HDLSS）场景下的学习挑战，探索多视图中融合技术的普适性。

Method: 提出三种视图构建方法，将高维特征向量拆分为子集作为不同视图，并采用多视图中融合技术。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在不同模型和学习任务中的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文为多视图中融合学习的普适性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) setting presents significant
challenges in various applications where the feature dimension far exceeds the
number of available samples. This paper introduces a universal approach for
learning in HDLSS setting using multi-view mid fusion techniques. It shows how
existing mid fusion multi-view methods perform well in an HDLSS setting even if
no inherent views are provided. Three view construction methods are proposed
that split the high-dimensional feature vectors into smaller subsets, each
representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across
model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of
the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further
research into the universal benefits of multi-view mid fusion learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合局部和全局卷积神经网络的LGCNN方法，用于解决地下水流动与热传输问题，克服了传统数值模拟和数据驱动模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在科学和工程应用中因训练数据有限或质量低而面临的挑战，特别是在地下水流动与热传输这类复杂问题中。

Method: 结合轻量级数值替代模型（全局）与卷积神经网络（局部），分别处理地下水速度和热扩散过程。

Result: 模型成功模拟了城市范围内的地下温度场，并在真实数据上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LGCNN方法在复杂地下水流动与热传输问题中表现出高效性和可扩展性，为类似问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量化感知训练（QAT）对SSM在边缘硬件（如模拟内存计算芯片）上的影响，以优化资源受限设备的部署。

Method: 通过QAT降低SSM复杂度，分析模型大小与数值精度的关系，并集成结构剪枝技术。

Result: QAT将SSM复杂度降低两个数量级，增强对模拟噪声的鲁棒性，并成功部署在模拟内存计算芯片上。

Conclusion: QAT显著提升SSM在边缘计算设备上的效率和适用性，为资源受限环境提供优化方案。

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoRE方法，通过分析推理轨迹的几何特性，实现无标签自评估，减少冗余推理步骤，提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）存在过度推理问题，导致推理效率低下，需要一种无需外部标签的自评估方法。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding（CoRE）方法，分析推理轨迹的几何特性，并开发训练免费、标签免费的自评估框架CoRE-Eval。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CoRE-Eval减少推理步骤13.7%-33.2%，同时提升答案准确率约10%，在AIME基准上达到70.0%准确率。

Conclusion: CoRE-Eval通过动态终止冗余推理，显著提升推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

TL;DR: 提出了ZO-SAH方法，一种基于子空间的零阶优化算法，通过随机选择二维子空间估计Hessian矩阵，显著降低计算成本并加速收敛。


<details>

Motivation: 在零阶优化中，二阶（曲率）信息可以加速收敛，但传统方法因Hessian矩阵估计成本高而受限。

Method: ZO-SAH在随机二维子空间中通过拟合二次多项式估计Hessian，并采用周期性子空间切换策略复用函数评估。

Result: 在八个基准数据集（包括逻辑回归和深度神经网络训练）上，ZO-SAH比现有零阶方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: ZO-SAH通过高效利用子空间和复用评估，显著降低了计算成本，同时提升了收敛速度。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献网络和知识图谱通常规模大、稀疏且噪声多，存在缺失链接的问题，需要一种方法推断隐藏关联并引导发现。

Method: 结合层次非负矩阵分解（HNMFk）、布尔矩阵分解（BNMFk）和逻辑矩阵分解（LMF），构建三级主题树，并通过集成方法融合离散可解释性和概率评分。

Result: 模型成功预测了缺失的链接（如超导性关联），并通过交互式仪表盘展示生成的假设。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂材料领域中有效发现隐藏关联，支持跨学科探索和科学发现。

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Result: 推导出两种高效优化目标以减少混叠，并对随机核的混叠行为进行了闭式表达分析。

Conclusion: 研究为卷积层的混叠行为提供了理论支持，并提出了实用的优化方法。

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了优化连接的有效性，为完全可训练的布尔逻辑网络提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a
probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting
the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Result: 新机制在语言建模基准测试中表现优于原始Mamba，提升了检索能力。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，新方法有效解决了Mamba模型的注意力分配问题，代码已公开。

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

Conclusion: RPG通过关系模式和任务特定决策器的结合，为Co-MARL提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) requires agents to
address catastrophic forgetting issues while learning new coordination policies
with the dynamics team. In this paper, we delve into the core of Co-MARL,
namely Relation Patterns, which refer to agents' general understanding of
interactions. In addition to generality, relation patterns exhibit
task-specificity when mapped to different action spaces. To this end, we
propose a novel method called General Relation Patterns-Guided Task-Specific
Decision-Maker (RPG). In RPG, agents extract relation patterns from dynamic
observation spaces using a relation capturer. These task-agnostic relation
patterns are then mapped to different action spaces via a task-specific
decision-maker generated by a conditional hypernetwork. To combat forgetting,
we further introduce regularization items on both the relation capturer and the
conditional hypernetwork. Results on SMAC and LBF demonstrate that RPG
effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks and
achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 论文通过扩展Diffusion Policy范式，评估了多任务机器人操作模型（LBMs）的性能，发现多任务预训练提高了策略的成功率和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 尽管机器人操作和基础模型取得了进展，但对真实世界性能的评估仍具挑战性，阻碍了发展和理解当前能力。

Method: 通过模拟和真实世界数据，扩展Diffusion Policy范式，提出并验证了评估多任务模型的流程。

Conclusion: 多任务预训练是提升机器人操作模型性能的有效方法，未来可进一步扩展规模和多样性。

Abstract: Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with
imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and
hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the
development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating
large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While
these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful
evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the
pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current
capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot
manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by
extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and
real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to
rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical
confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized
trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world
experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more
successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,
using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,
performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决海洋机器人中立体声数据融合的问题，特别是在跨模态声纳系统中实现特征对应和3D信息恢复。

Method: 借鉴立体相机的极线几何，提出声纳几何模型，利用相对位姿信息将特征从一个声纳图像投影到另一个声纳图像。

Result: 通过仿真结果，确定了适用于特征对应和3D信息恢复的理想立体配置。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态立体声纳系统的特征投影提供了有效的几何解决方案，适用于海洋机器人应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we address stereo acoustic data fusion for marine robotics and
propose a geometry-based method for projecting observed features from one sonar
to another for a cross-modal stereo sonar setup that consists of both a
forward-looking and a sidescan sonar. Our acoustic geometry for sidescan and
forward-looking sonar is inspired by the epipolar geometry for stereo cameras,
and we leverage relative pose information to project where an observed feature
in one sonar image will be found in the image of another sonar. Additionally,
we analyze how both the feature location relative to the sonar and the relative
pose between the two sonars impact the projection. From simulated results, we
identify desirable stereo configurations for applications in field robotics
like feature correspondence and recovery of the 3D information of the feature.

TL;DR: CRED是一种用于主动偏好学习（APL）的轨迹生成方法，通过联合优化环境设计和轨迹选择来改进奖励估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要适应人类偏好（如距离、时间和安全的平衡），但现有方法在长时任务中难以探索完整轨迹空间和识别信息性查询。

Method: CRED通过环境设计“想象”新场景，并利用反事实推理生成多样且信息丰富的轨迹用于排名。

Result: 在GridWorld和OpenStreetMap数据上的实验表明，CRED改进了奖励学习并在不同环境中有效泛化。

Conclusion: CRED通过联合优化环境设计和轨迹选择，显著提升了主动偏好学习的效果。

Abstract: For effective real-world deployment, robots should adapt to human
preferences, such as balancing distance, time, and safety in delivery routing.
Active preference learning (APL) learns human reward functions by presenting
trajectories for ranking. However, existing methods often struggle to explore
the full trajectory space and fail to identify informative queries,
particularly in long-horizon tasks. We propose CRED, a trajectory generation
method for APL that improves reward estimation by jointly optimizing
environment design and trajectory selection. CRED "imagines" new scenarios
through environment design and uses counterfactual reasoning -- by sampling
rewards from its current belief and asking "What if this reward were the true
preference?" -- to generate a diverse and informative set of trajectories for
ranking. Experiments in GridWorld and real-world navigation using OpenStreetMap
data show that CRED improves reward learning and generalizes effectively across
different environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人因缺乏先验知识难以理解物体属性（如形状、材质等），而人类通过多感官交互学习这些属性。

Method: 提出GPDF表示，结合视觉和触觉观测，通过点云构建距离函数，无需大量预训练数据，支持迭代优化几何形状。

Result: 实验使用Franka Research 3机器人，结合触觉传感器和RGBD相机，成功探索静态物体的形状和属性。

Conclusion: GPDF方法通过多模态融合实现了复杂物体几何的主动探索与建模，并具有扩展到几何以外属性的潜力。

Abstract: Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and
semantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in
unstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through
interactive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and
tactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)
representation for active perception of object properties. While primarily
focusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling
surface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using
point cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,
which are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By
utilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need
extensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by
aggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework
iteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using
differentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.
By quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to
maximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the
real-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot
manipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile
sensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In
these experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects
assumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we
investigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian
Processes. This probabilistic multi-modal fusion enables active exploration and
mapping of complex object geometries, extending potentially beyond geometry.

Abstract: We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular
ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With
PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control
them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming
controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of
teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task
requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable
puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target
robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these
puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot.
By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides
real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction
awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements
of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research
in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various
real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations
of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人系统依赖预定义脚本或大规模演示数据，而Auto-RubikAI旨在实现可解释的多步任务执行，无需演示数据。

Method: 系统采用知识库模块解决符号推理问题，视觉语言模型解析RGB-D输入构建语义3D场景，大语言模型通过提示链生成结构化控制代码。

Result: 实验显示79%的任务成功率，相比基线方法减少步骤并保持可解释性和安全性。

Conclusion: Auto-RubikAI为智能制造和机器人教育提供了高效、模块化的任务规划基础。

Abstract: This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework
that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM),
and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks
exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based
on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and
large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step
task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The
proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps,
overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to
construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates
structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module
architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy
Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic
arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining.
Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized
configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our
KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining
interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular
foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics
education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware
modules will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在灾害响应或监视任务中，快速识别需要紧急关注的区域至关重要，但部署团队到每个位置效率低下或不可行。需要协调多机器人团队优先检查可能急需响应的区域，同时减少移动时间。

Method: 使用图神经网络从噪声传感器数据中估计兴趣点需要关注的可能性，并基于此预测指导多机器人模型规划器，制定成本效益高的计划。

Result: 模拟实验显示，相比非学习和学习基线，该规划器在1、3和5机器人场景下分别提升了16.3%、26.7%和26.2%的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在模拟和真实四旋翼飞行器平台上均验证了有效性，为时间关键的多机器人搜索任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas
needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every
location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this
domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize
inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also
minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must
directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional
attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for
coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach
uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing
attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a
multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated
experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by
16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to
non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world
platforms using quad-copters.

Result: 实验显示DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何，并支持下游任务如顺序清理和目标检索。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp克服了现有方法的限制，适用于复杂多物体环境。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

Motivation: 超越半经验地形力学方法（如Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto），提供基于物理的模型，以处理更复杂的任务。

Method: 基于Chrono的平滑粒子流体动力学（SPH）框架，支持地形与刚性和柔性工具的交互，并通过GPU加速实现高效计算。

Conclusion: Chrono::CRM能够处理大规模地形模拟（10公里长，1亿SPH粒子），开源且高效，适用于高保真越野模拟。

Abstract: This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein
Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution
for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics
approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model
able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction
with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics
model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid
and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate
Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one
involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against
a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario
involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR).
Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable
to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems.
Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain
stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive
rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a
component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released
under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are
available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further
research.

Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位不可靠及传统地图方法存储和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，采用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，3DGS-LSR在城镇道路、林荫大道和交通密集高速公路上的平均定位精度分别为0.026m、0.029m和0.081m，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中提供了可靠的定位能力。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

Conclusion: 该研究为RCM机械臂的稳定控制提供了新方法，是迈向自主手术的重要一步。

Abstract: Remote Center of Motion (RCM) robotic manipulators have revolutionized
Minimally Invasive Surgery, enabling precise, dexterous surgical manipulation
within the patient's body cavity without disturbing the insertion point on the
patient. Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous
subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic
surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes.
However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading
errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control.
Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view
joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are
irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized
the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing
a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion
of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this
controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We
rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify
our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps
required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation
learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion
models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task
generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency.
While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in
legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding
errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited
data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in
legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address
these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework
for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO
finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions.
Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using
diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then,
it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task
transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion
Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized
deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient
solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained
robotic platforms.

Conclusion: hPGA-DP通过几何归纳偏置和混合架构显著提升了扩散策略的性能和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to
their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these
policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones,
conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a
robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations
and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to
ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating
geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this
redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical
framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric
inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it
provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric
primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks
to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable
operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that
incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging
its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts
a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action
decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising
process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task
performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but
also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model
compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了自动驾驶的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.
Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making
control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety
risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both
aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning
(EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on
evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness
according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware
constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC
algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications.
Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains
efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative

Abstract: High fidelity estimation algorithms for robotics require accurate data.
However, timestamping of sensor data is a key issue that rarely receives the
attention it deserves. Inaccurate timestamping can be compensated for in
post-processing but is imperative for online estimation. Simultaneously, even
online mitigation of timing issues can be achieved through a relaxation of the
tuning parameters from their otherwise more performative optimal values, but at
a detriment to performance. To address the need for real-time, low-cost
timestamping, a versatile system which utilizes readily-available components
and established methods for synchronization is introduced. The synchronization
and triggering (of both high- and low-rate sensors) capabilities of the system
are demonstrated.

Abstract: Inertia drift is a transitional maneuver between two sustained drift stages
in opposite directions, which provides valuable insights for navigating
consecutive sharp corners for autonomous racing.However, this can be a
challenging scenario for the drift controller to handle rapid transitions
between opposing sideslip angles while maintaining accurate path tracking.
Moreover, accurate drift control depends on a high-fidelity vehicle model to
derive drift equilibrium points and predict vehicle states, but this is often
compromised by the strongly coupled longitudinal-lateral drift dynamics and
unpredictable environmental variations. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth
transition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift
phases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy
that mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation
results on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework
can achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.

Conclusion: LeAD通过双速率架构和LLM增强，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route
completion of 93%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化联邦学习框架，通过分析GPD模型的学习动态，优化通信效率，提升抓取姿势检测的准确性和机器人实际表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPD依赖大数据集带来的隐私和中心化问题，以及联邦学习在资源受限机器人中的通信开销问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先全模型训练，再针对收敛较慢的模块进行高效通信训练。

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集上优于FedAvg等基线方法，实际机器人实验中抓取成功率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架在通信成本和模型性能之间取得更好平衡，适用于去中心化训练鲁棒的GPD模型。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Method: 使用高分辨率卫星图像和LiDAR数据构建加权像素级路网，测试A*、Dijkstra、RRT*和NIACO算法在2D和3D场景中的性能。

Result: Dijkstra算法在路径成本、计算时间和内存消耗方面表现最优，尤其在密集像素级地理路网中。

Conclusion: Dijkstra算法在静态地形导航中可靠，为未来动态路径规划研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic grasping have led to its integration as a core
module in many manipulation systems. For instance, language-driven semantic
segmentation enables the grasping of any designated object or object part.
However, existing methods often struggle to generate feasible grasp poses for
small objects or delicate components, potentially causing the entire pipeline
to fail. To address this issue, we propose a novel grasping method, FineGrasp,
which introduces improvements in three key aspects. First, we introduce
multiple network modifications to enhance the ability of to handle delicate
regions. Second, we address the issue of label imbalance and propose a refined
graspness label normalization strategy. Third, we introduce a new simulated

performance. Experimental results show significant improvements, especially in
grasping small objects, and confirm the effectiveness of our system in semantic
grasping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中心静脉置管（CVC）的成功率受限于解剖变异和操作者依赖性，错误可能导致严重并发症。机器人系统虽能提供解决方案，但实现完全自主仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过深度学习模型从深度图像识别解剖标志，机器人运动规划框架完成血管扫描、重建和定位，并结合超声引导和操作者反馈进行针插入。

Result: 在10次模拟临床场景中，首次尝试成功率为100%，血管重建平均误差2.15毫米，针插入误差小于或接近1毫米。

Conclusion: 这是首个在高仿真模型上展示的集成规划、扫描和插入的机器人CVC系统，具有临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure
for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its
success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided
visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further
complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle
placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems
offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In
this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,
from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a
deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a
depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously
define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework
is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and
arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.
Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance
with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity
commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The
proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the
first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15
\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less
than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first
robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated
planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for
clinical translation.

Result: 算法能够准确估计语音工作负荷，并在不同个体和人机协作模式中表现出通用性。

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计是开发自适应人机系统的关键要素。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Abstract: Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task.
Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through
pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while
capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured
environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot
arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but
typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces
necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing
adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging
for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse
kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control.
Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue
from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average
of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of
exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging
contamination from surfaces.

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities
between dynamic objects with uncertain trajectories, where the trajectories are
given as a sequence of poses with Gaussian distributions. We propose an
adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple
algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error
of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the
collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior
work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability.
Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world
scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs,
where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Abstract: Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for
extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in
standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a
simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and
accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile
perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise
management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack &
tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring
by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work,
we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching,
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from
Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal
demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness,
achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables
the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating
reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through
extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness
in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.

Conclusion: 4通道双边控制为低成本机械臂提供了高保真远程操作和数据收集的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Conclusion: EC-Flow为复杂机器人操作任务提供了一种高效且易于实践的解决方案。

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

optimization framework allows system designers to prioritize noise reduction at
specific spatial locations through strategically defined linear constraints,
providing a more flexible alternative to uniformly weighted multipoint error
minimization. An adaptive algorithm based on filtered-X least mean squares
(FxLMS) is derived for online adaptation of filter coefficients. Simulation and
experimental results validate the proposed method's noise reduction and
constraint adherence, demonstrating effective, spatially selective, and
broadband noise control compared to multipoint volumetric noise control.

Conclusion: 多随机投影方法为自适应波束形成器设计提供了新的自由度，能够更好地利用信号结构，并推导了压缩波束形成器输出功率的上下界。

Abstract: Beamformers often trade off white noise gain against the ability to suppress
interferers. With distributed microphone arrays, this trade-off becomes crucial
as different arrays capture vastly different magnitude and phase differences
for each source. We propose the use of multiple random projections as a
first-stage preprocessing scheme in a data-driven approach to dimensionality
reduction and beamforming. We show that a mixture beamformer derived from the
use of multiple such random projections can effectively outperform the minimum
variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer in terms of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interferer-and-noise ratio (SINR) gain. Moreover, our
method introduces computational complexity as a trade-off in the design of
adaptive beamformers, alongside noise gain and interferer suppression. This
added degree of freedom allows the algorithm to better exploit the inherent
structure of the received signal and achieve better real-time performance while
requiring fewer computations. Finally, we derive upper and lower bounds for the
output power of the compressed beamformer when compared to the full complexity
MVDR beamformer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Mamba的语音清晰度预测（SIP）模型，以替代传统的Transformer模型，旨在降低计算和内存成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于Transformer的SIP模型在计算和内存成本上较高，限制了其在低延迟、高效能设备中的应用。

Method: 采用Mamba替代Transformer作为时间处理模块，构建非侵入式双耳SIP模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于Mamba的SIP模型在保持较少参数的同时，性能与基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 双向Mamba能够有效捕捉双耳信号的上下文和空间信息，为SIP模型提供了一种高效替代方案。

Abstract: Speech intelligibility prediction (SIP) models have been used as objective
metrics to assess intelligibility for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners. In the
Clarity Prediction Challenge 2 (CPC2), non-intrusive binaural SIP models based
on transformers showed high prediction accuracy. However, the self-attention
mechanism theoretically incurs high computational and memory costs, making it a
bottleneck for low-latency, power-efficient devices. This may also degrade the
temporal processing of binaural SIPs. Therefore, we propose Mamba-based SIP
models instead of transformers for the temporal processing blocks. Experimental
results show that our proposed SIP model achieves competitive performance
compared to the baseline while maintaining a relatively small number of
parameters. Our analysis suggests that the SIP model based on bidirectional
Mamba effectively captures contextual and spatial speech information from
binaural signals.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂水下环境中的中继选择提供了实用且有效的基础。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in an
underwater acoustic network. Unlike the objectives of most existing literature,
two distinct objectives, namely classical stable arrangement and ambiguous
stable arrangement, are considered. To achieve these stable arrangements, a
laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method is introduced to
efficiently obtain high throughput and rapidly attain stability. In order to
sufficiently explore the relay's decision-making, this method uses random
numbers generated by laser chaos to learn the assignment of relays to multiple
source nodes. This study finds that the laser chaos-based random number and
multi-processing in the exchange process have a positive effect on higher
throughput and strong adaptability with environmental changing over time.
Meanwhile, ambiguous cognitions result in the stable configuration with less
volatility compared to accurate ones. This provides a practical and useful
method and can be the basis for relay selection in complex underwater
environments.

TL;DR: DiffRO是一种新颖的可微分奖励优化方法，用于提升基于神经编解码语言模型的TTS系统性能，通过直接计算神经编解码令牌的奖励并使用Gumbel-Softmax技术，优化了RLHF训练过程。结合多任务奖励模型，显著提升了发音准确性和指令跟随能力。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF方法在TTS中依赖合成音频计算奖励，效率较低。DiffRO旨在通过直接处理神经编解码令牌和引入可微分奖励函数，提升训练效率和系统性能。

Method: 提出DiffRO方法，直接基于神经编解码令牌计算奖励，并使用Gumbel-Softmax技术使奖励函数可微分。引入多任务奖励模型（MTR）提供多角度反馈。

Result: DiffRO显著提升了TTS系统的发音准确性，在seed-tts-eval基准上达到SOTA WER结果。MTR模型实现了情感和质量属性的零样本控制。

Conclusion: DiffRO通过可微分奖励优化和多任务奖励模型，有效提升了TTS系统的性能和灵活性，为RLHF在TTS中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO)
method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly
compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on
synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to
render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF
training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model
which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can
augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental
results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy
of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the
seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we
demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a
zero-shot manner.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度神经网络的音频指纹识别方法在受控条件下表现良好，但在真实噪声环境中性能显著下降。

Method: 引入新的评估协议，生成不同噪声水平的录音；改进数据增强管道；开发基于Transformer的模型并利用语义相关领域的知识迁移。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估协议和数据增强，Transformer模型在真实噪声环境中表现更鲁棒。

Abstract: Recent advances in song identification leverage deep neural networks to learn
compact audio fingerprints directly from raw waveforms. While these methods
perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in
real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed
to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of
the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile
device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two
state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously
reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the
augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction
low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly
increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation.
Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection
module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant
domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms
CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise
conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in
finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best
performing model, respectively, Under heavy noise levels, we achieve a
detection rate 56.5% for 15-second query duration. All experiments are
conducted on public large-scale dataset of over 100K songs, with queries
matched against a database of 56 million vectors.

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment plays a crucial role in the development
of speech synthesis systems, but existing models exhibit significant
performance variations across different granularity levels of prediction tasks.
This paper proposes an enhanced MOS prediction system based on self-supervised
learning speech models, incorporating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification
head and utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models
for data augmentation. Our method builds upon existing self-supervised models
such as wav2vec2, designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different
types of speech quality assessment tasks. We also collected a large-scale
synthetic speech dataset encompassing the latest text-to-speech, speech
conversion, and speech enhancement systems. However, despite the adoption of
the MoE architecture and expanded dataset, the model's performance improvements
in sentence-level prediction tasks remain limited. Our work reveals the
limitations of current methods in handling sentence-level quality assessment,
provides new technical pathways for the field of automatic speech quality
assessment, and also delves into the fundamental causes of performance
differences across different assessment granularities.

Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse
phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and
financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in
contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical
foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity
and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with
particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial
obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node
identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node
identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes:
centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network
control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review
bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods
based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by
highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different
network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by
identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time
evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and
computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis
consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in
modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine
learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for
complex systems.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies
is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic
design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,
presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform
computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In
response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in
protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The
key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the
folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of
its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as
a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be
fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited
binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first
deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical
force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued
neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a
fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field
theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures
to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued
weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting
hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce
anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through
analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum
state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the
input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the
quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output
layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free
fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.
The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to
fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.
It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding
fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications
in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散模型在LACT重建中需要大量采样步骤，计算开销大；现有的跳采样策略虽提高效率但损失细节。PWD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PWD在训练阶段学习LACT图像与目标图像的分布映射，推理阶段利用LACT图像作为先验指导采样轨迹，并结合小波域多尺度特征融合增强细节重建。

Result: 在临床牙弓CBCT和根尖数据集上，PWD仅需50步采样，PSNR提升至少1.7 dB，SSIM提升10%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PWD通过先验信息嵌入和小波特征融合，实现了高效且高质量的LACT重建，显著减少了计算开销并保留了细节。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割在CT扫描中至关重要，但分割掩模稀缺且制作耗时。利用大量现成的放射学报告补充稀缺的掩模数据是提升AI性能的关键。

Method: 提出报告监督损失（R-Super），将放射学报告转化为体素级监督信号，结合公开数据集（AbdomenAtlas 2.0）和自建数据集（6,718对CT-报告）训练AI。

Result: 在内部和外部验证中，肿瘤分割性能显著提升，F1分数最高提高16%。

Conclusion: R-Super通过利用放射学报告，显著提升了AI的分割性能，尤其在掩模数据稀缺或丰富时均表现优异。

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

Motivation: 有限角度CT（LACT）因缺失角度投影导致重建图像存在严重伪影，现有方法多假设理想无噪声测量，未考虑实际噪声影响。

Method: 将LACT视为正弦图修复任务，采用MR-SDE框架完成缺失角度视图，并提出噪声感知机制RNSD$^+$以提升噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据一致性和感知质量上优于基线模型，且对不同噪声强度和采集场景具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型框架和RNSD$^+$机制有效解决了噪声环境下的LACT重建问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset
is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part

Conclusion: TCv2为病理图像分析提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，同时降低了资源需求。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology
by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically
relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a
resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the
extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide
images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for
whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end
multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the
training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model
shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared
trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across
different tasks.

Motivation: 实现IVUS和OCT图像的自动化配准，提高大规模多模态成像研究的效率。

Method: 利用深度学习提取图像特征，结合动态时间规整和动态编程算法完成配准。

Result: DL方法在测试集上表现出高一致性（纵向>0.99，圆周>0.90），处理时间<90秒。

Conclusion: 该框架快速且准确，适用于大规模多模态成像研究。

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully
automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and
results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that
underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their
non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction
of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and
OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based
framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is
fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.
These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale
data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to
characterize plaque composition.

TL;DR: 通过多模态学习和可学习配准模块提升CBCT到sCT的生成质量，显著改善低质量CBCT和未对齐CT的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT图像存在伪影和视觉质量低的问题，需通过合成CT（sCT）生成技术改进。

Method: 结合术中CBCT和术前CT数据，引入端到端可学习配准模块，优化sCT生成流程。

Result: 在90个评估设置中，79个优于基线方法，尤其在CBCT质量低且CT未对齐时效果显著。

Conclusion: 多模态学习与配准模块的结合显著提升了sCT生成质量。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LangMamba是一种基于语言驱动的Mamba框架，用于低剂量CT（LDCT）去噪，通过结合视觉语言模型（VLM）的语义信息提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）在减少辐射暴露的同时可能降低图像质量，影响诊断准确性。现有深度学习方法主要关注像素级映射，忽略了高级语义信息的潜在优势。

Method: LangMamba采用两阶段学习策略：1）预训练语言引导的自编码器（LangAE），利用VLM将正常剂量CT（NDCT）映射到语义空间；2）结合SEED模块和LangDA损失，增强语义引导的去噪效果。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，LangMamba优于现有方法，显著提升了细节保留和视觉保真度，且LangAE具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言作为监督信号在LDCT去噪中具有潜力，LangMamba为图像重建提供了新的思路，并展示了语言引导方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on
https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

Motivation: 儿科医学影像因解剖和发育差异与成人不同，直接使用成人数据训练的分割模型效果不佳，需探索优化策略。

Method: 利用nnU-Net框架，从四个关键维度（指纹数据集、学习集、数据增强参数、迁移学习方法）研究儿科分割方法，提出PSAT进行系统评估。

Conclusion: PSAT为儿科医学影像分割提供了实用见解，强调持续学习的重要性，并开源代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: Pediatric medical imaging presents unique challenges due to significant
anatomical and developmental differences compared to adults. Direct application
of segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal
performance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address
these challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been
proposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult,
pediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including
the network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric,
or mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning
method (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT
(Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer
learning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on
segmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric
CT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a
commercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides
actionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments
reveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned
with pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation,
especially when segmenting fine structures-and that continual learning
strategies mitigate institutional shifts, thus enhancing generalization across
diverse pediatric datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 无需直接人工标注，仅需二元偏好反馈即可实现竞争性分割性能。

Abstract: Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming
process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of
robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI
collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially
reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual
pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning
paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply
indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a
previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable
foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on
feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse
feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round
segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation
network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label
propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary
preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate
the images.

Motivation: 现有BPDN算法在高维应用中无法同时满足效率和精度需求，亟需改进。

Method: 利用微分包含理论将BPDN对偶问题转化为可积投影动力系统的轨迹计算，提出精确算法。

Result: 算法在数值实验中表现出色，优于现有方法，并能计算正则化路径。

Conclusion: 该算法为BPDN提供高效精确解决方案，并可推广至更广泛的优化问题。

Abstract: Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing,
statistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been
proposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor
efficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art
algorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require
accurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this
work, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for
BPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection
principle from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of
BPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \emph{integrable} projected
dynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be
computed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically
up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and
very fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show
that the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and
data) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm
for BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions
to basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that
our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate
solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.

Method: 分析了基于零阶梯度估计的优化算法，特别是投影零阶梯度下降（ZO-GD），并研究了其隐私损失。

Result: 发现对于某些强凸目标函数，ZO-GD无法保证差分隐私；在凸函数优化中，隐私损失可能随迭代次数超线性增长。

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法的固有噪声不足以确保差分隐私，需进一步改进隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently gained
popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their
reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order
methods rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients.
However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently
random, researchers including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have
raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators
sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This
work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms
where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we
show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective
functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD)
is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random
initialization and without revealing (initial and) intermediate iterates, the
privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when
minimizing convex objective functions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为美国本土提供一种计算效率更高的天气预报替代方案，同时提升预测性能。

Method: HRRRCast包含两种架构：基于ResNet的ResHRRR和基于图神经网络的GraphHRRR。ResHRRR使用卷积神经网络，支持概率预测，并通过多时间步训练和贪婪策略提升长时预测能力。

Result: ResHRRR在轻雨阈值（20 dBZ）上优于HRRR，在中雨阈值（30 dBZ）上表现相当。网格、邻域和对象指标均显示更好的风暴定位和更低的频率偏差。

Conclusion: HRRRCast在高效数据驱动的区域天气预报方面迈出了重要一步，具有竞争性的准确性和集合能力。

Abstract: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model
used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States
(CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce
HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning
techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)
and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional
neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise
Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a
single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy
rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity
over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR
outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves
competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the
StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,
b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on
analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in
StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling
downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and
object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and
higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain
sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.
While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for
future graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,
data-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble
capability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results
on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to
decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words"
that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from
natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar.
Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved
high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do
not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To
address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate
sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as
they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT
to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely,
BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths
along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and
BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel
representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate
that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological
functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the
model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP
imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we
acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully
evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future
and encourage community contributions, we release our models through
HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，获取真实SQL查询困难，现有生成方法在定制化和满足现实约束方面有限。

Method: SQLBarber通过声明式接口、LLM增强的管道（含自校正模块）和贝叶斯优化器，高效生成符合目标成本分布的SQL查询。

Result: 实验表明，SQLBarber是唯一能生成定制SQL模板的系统，生成时间减少1-3个数量级，且与目标成本分布更匹配。

Conclusion: SQLBarber为数据库研究和开发提供了高效、灵活的SQL查询生成解决方案。

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

TL;DR: 3DGeoMeshNet是一种基于GCN的新框架，通过各向异性卷积层在空间域中学习全局和局部特征，直接处理多边形网格，提高了3D网格重建的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D网格的非欧几里得性质，传统CNN难以处理，而现有GCN方法多依赖各向同性滤波器或谱分解，无法同时捕捉局部和全局特征。

Method: 提出3DGeoMeshNet，采用各向异性卷积层和多尺度编码器-解码器结构，直接在空间域中处理原始网格数据。

Result: 在COMA人脸数据集上的实验表明，3DGeoMeshNet在重建精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet通过直接处理网格数据和多尺度特征学习，显著提升了3D形状重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LighthouseGS是一个基于3D高斯散射（3DGS）的实时新视角合成框架，通过手持设备（如手机）的简单全景运动实现高质量渲染，解决了纹理缺失室内场景中的相机姿态和3D点估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法需要高精度图像覆盖整个场景，限制了普通用户的使用。本文旨在开发一种更实用的框架，适用于手持设备的简单全景运动。

Method: 提出LighthouseGS框架，利用粗略几何先验（如相机姿态和单目深度估计）和室内平面结构，通过平面支架组装初始化和稳定剪枝策略优化3D点，并引入几何和光度校正解决运动漂移和自动曝光问题。

Result: 在真实和合成的室内场景测试中，LighthouseGS实现了逼真渲染，优于现有方法，展示了全景视图合成和物体放置的潜力。

Conclusion: LighthouseGS为手持设备提供了一种高效的3DGS框架，显著提升了纹理缺失室内场景的渲染质量，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Result: 设计了FSA，能够提供上下文感知的反馈，并在学生遇到困难时提供精准帮助。

Conclusion: FSA具有可扩展性和灵活性，未来将进行实证评估和更广泛的教育集成。

Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical
scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This
paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA),
a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation
(MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to
continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents
(e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined
fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and
contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in
real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and
provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work
focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its
potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in
simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical
evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed

*Dennis Müller,Maurice Chiodo,Mitja Sienknecht*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI系统在军事决策中的整合问题，重点关注了集成者的角色及其挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在军事决策中的整合，特别是集成者在连接开发者和用户中的作用及其面临的挑战。

Method: 通过三个步骤分析：1) 将不同行为者与AI系统的关系概念化为社会技术系统；2) 识别RTF决策中人机协作的挑战；3) 提出政策建议。

Result: 揭示了AI系统整合中的技术、角色和人机交互挑战，并提出了解决方案。

Conclusion: 强调了集成者的重要性，并提供了改善AI系统整合的政策建议。

Abstract: The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way
war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of
actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between
these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and
system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often
neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex
human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the
disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.
To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other
groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and
shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)
decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed
in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different
groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify
challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We
focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the
integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine
interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these
shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了不同人机交互（HITL）设置的法律合规性与安全性，揭示了法律责任分配与技术可解释性之间的不可避免的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于识别新的HITL设置选择方法，并指出现有法律框架的不足，以避免不必要的人类替罪羊现象。

Method: 通过计算理论中的预言机概念形式化HITL设置，并分类其失败模式，分析法律框架的局限性。

Result: 研究发现HITL设置涉及多项技术设计决策，且容易发生超出人类控制的失败。

Conclusion: 结论指出HITL设置需要更细致的法律认可和责任分配，以更好地实现伦理、法律和社会技术目标。

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

Result: 指出当前治理框架无法应对算法交互的复杂性，可能导致严重后果。

Conclusion: 结论是需要改进治理框架，增加透明度和问责制以应对系统性风险。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估匈牙利国家AI战略的执行效果，发现实施中的问题，并借鉴新加坡的经验提出改进建议。

Method: 通过分析战略文件、公开财务记录和专家访谈，评估22个战略目标，并与新加坡的AI战略进行对比。

Result: 发现匈牙利在AI相关公共投资总额达46.5亿欧元，但资金分配不均，执行碎片化，且缺乏定期审查。

Conclusion: 建议匈牙利在新战略中适应大语言模型时代，优化治理结构，并利用其地理位置优势成为东西方汽车AI实验的桥梁。

Abstract: The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation
through the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial
records, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and
Chief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from
Hungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and
financial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI
Strategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of
EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available
financial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three
projects made up 98\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals
Hungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following
ministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews
since 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for
Hungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a
reference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models,
restructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective
dialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for
automotive AI experimentation.

Motivation: 探索生成式AI在BIM合规任务中的应用，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过讲座和作业，学生使用LLM检查设计中的代码违规，并通过调查和NASA-TLX量表评估效果。

Result: 学生达成学习目标，但调试AI生成代码和工具性能问题增加了认知负担。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战，学生对未来生成式AI应用表现出浓厚兴趣，尤其在明确教学支持下。

Abstract: This study evaluates the implementation of a Generative AI-powered rule
checking workflow within a graduate-level Building Information Modeling (BIM)
course at a U.S. university. Over two semesters, 55 students participated in a
classroom-based pilot exploring the use of GenAI for BIM compliance tasks, an
area with limited prior research. The instructional design included lectures on
prompt engineering and AI-driven rule checking, followed by an assignment where
students used a large language model (LLM) to identify code violations in
designs using Autodesk Revit. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess
student workload, learning effectiveness, and overall experience, using the
NASA-TLX scale and regression analysis. Findings indicate students generally
achieved learning objectives but faced challenges such as difficulties
debugging AI-generated code and inconsistent tool performance, probably due to
their limited prompt engineering experience. These issues increased cognitive
and emotional strain, especially among students with minimal programming
backgrounds. Despite these challenges, students expressed strong interest in
future GenAI applications, particularly with clear instructional support.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（如ChatGPT和Gemini）在教育场景中的计算成本高、过度辅助等问题，探索更适合教学的小型专业模型。

Method: 使用40,000条C编译器错误数据集对Qwen3-4B、Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen3-32B进行监督微调，并通过专家评审和自动化评估验证效果。

Result: 监督微调显著提升小型模型的教学质量，性能接近大型模型，验证了高效小模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 高质量领域数据微调的小型模型是教育工具的理想选择，提供了可复现的方法论以促进教育AI的普及。

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher
cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,
cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread
pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language
models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable
alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C
compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable
methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in
educational contexts.

Result: AGACCI在评分和反馈准确性、相关性、一致性和连贯性方面优于单GPT基线。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统在可扩展和情境感知的教育评估中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of
vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks
that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing
VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as
programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that
require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation
criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes
specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy,
interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the
framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60
participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and
qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms
a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy,
relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional
intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies
across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for
scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.

Conclusion: 结论强调需要在提交门户进行技术筛查，并制定统一的生成式AI使用政策，以应对学术评估中的系统性风险。

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow daily, more exciting (and
somewhat controversial) technology emerges every other day. As we see the
advancements in AI, we see more and more people becoming skeptical of it. This
paper explores the complications and confusion around the ethics of generative
AI art. We delve deep into the ethical side of AI, specifically generative art.
We step back from the excitement and observe the impossible conundrums that
this impressive technology produces. Covering environmental consequences,
celebrity representation, intellectual property, deep fakes, and artist
displacement. Our research found that generative AI art is responsible for
increased carbon emissions, spreading misinformation, copyright infringement,
unlawful depiction, and job displacement. In light of this, we propose multiple
possible solutions for these problems. We address each situation's history,
cause, and consequences and offer different viewpoints. At the root of it all,
though, the central theme is that generative AI Art needs to be correctly
legislated and regulated.

Motivation: 时钟网格在高性能VLSI系统中至关重要，但传统分析方法（如SPICE仿真）速度慢，简化模型又忽略了关键效应。

Method: 提出GATMesh，将时钟网格建模为带有增强结构和物理特征的图，并基于SPICE数据进行训练。

Result: GATMesh在未见过的基准测试中平均延迟误差为5.27ps，速度比多线程SPICE仿真快47146倍。

Conclusion: GATMesh在时钟网格分析中实现了高精度和高效性，为VLSI设计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing
skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to
reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew. SPICE
simulations are accurate but slow; yet simplified models miss key effects like
slew and input skew. We propose GATMesh, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and
physical features. Trained on SPICE data, GATMesh achieves high accuracy with
average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups
of 47146x over multi-threaded SPICE simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前缀加法器的设计空间随位宽指数增长，现有方法在性能、泛化和可扩展性方面存在局限，需要新的优化方法。

Method: PrefixAgent将问题分解为子任务（如骨架合成和结构优化），并利用E-graph收集高质量数据和推理轨迹，以微调LLM。

Result: 实验表明，PrefixAgent生成的前缀加法器面积更小，同时在商用EDA流程中保持可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PrefixAgent通过LLM和任务分解，有效解决了前缀加法器优化问题，为电路设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space
grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges.
Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder
optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks
including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively
reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables
us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with

Motivation: 解决卫星图像下载的挑战，如快速运动、短暂接触窗口和大数据量，以支持近实时地球观测应用。

Result: 在真实卫星数据集上，准确率提升31.2%，延迟降低51.2%。

Conclusion: SpaceVerse系统有效解决了卫星图像处理的挑战，为近实时地球观测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis
capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in
the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station
(GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download
challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g.,
disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM
in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground
synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact
LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs
to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and
communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network
and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite
inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission,
separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite
constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a
51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的移动设备上部署DNN面临实时性能和资源限制的挑战，现有方法存在传输瓶颈。

Result: Intra-DP将推理延迟降低50%，能耗降低75%，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: Intra-DP有效解决了MEC中的传输瓶颈问题，实现了高效节能的DNN推理。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices
presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time
performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources
and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative
inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches
primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant
transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations.
To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance
collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP
employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e.,
operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the
convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into
several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and
transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP
mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient
inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference
latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: 多分类逻辑Bandit的遗憾界可显著改进，且κ_*的依赖是最优的。

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized
linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting
actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from
multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on
understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et
al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant
$\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and
which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates
the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from
$\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial
logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with
more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems.
To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial
setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's
non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $
\smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the
number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing
guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $.
Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound,
showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融时间序列中的非平稳性、波动性聚类和制度转换问题，提供无需严格参数假设的预测区间。

Result: 在S&P 500、比特币和黄金等资产上，TCP提供更精确的预测区间，尤其在波动性高时表现更优。

Conclusion: TCP为金融不确定性量化提供了一种无分布、自适应且可解释的解决方案，推动了统计推断与机器学习的结合。

Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a novel framework for
constructing prediction intervals in financial time-series with guaranteed
finite-sample validity. TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal
calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid
design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to
accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which
are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric
assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH,
Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P
500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show
that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior
coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's
strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in
modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and
interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing
the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.

Conclusion: 为生成模型中的得分估计方法提供了理论基础，并扩展了随机微分方程的应用范围。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful
tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the
score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to
the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a
variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score
matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we
derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad
class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern
stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint
operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type
formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written
entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all
Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its
practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work
offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in
generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for
complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader
classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the
development of score-based diffusion generative models.

Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution
can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of
property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is
motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine
learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and
replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide
necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we
explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --
the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum
Bayes risk distribution.

Result: 平滑的SBoN能有效缓解奖励过优化，尤其在代理奖励质量较低时。

Conclusion: SBoN在理论和实证上均优于BoN，尤其在代理奖励模型不完善时表现更佳。

Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative
models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference
policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is
selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL
tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the
proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a
smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical
framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by
providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference
policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of
samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true
reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and
empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward
overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.

Conclusion: 新方法在近似贝叶斯计算和粒子流模拟中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.

Conclusion: PQ为量化学习中的不确定性量化提供了深入见解，是一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point
in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to
estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in
prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the
training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard
methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping
and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in
terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.
the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise
Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing
quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ
and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through
these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification
precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of
the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled
dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights
into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.

Conclusion: 该算法在序列依赖性显著的市场中具有广泛适用性，即使广义Kelly准则不成立，仍能表现优异。

Abstract: In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms
generate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared
to the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being
consistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be
improved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in
feature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial
dependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar
effects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are
commonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an
algorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,
without any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that
eventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing
portfolio.
  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'
returns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as
an independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such
a stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary
processes fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a
strategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,
matching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly
criterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the
theoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as
long as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the
generalized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms
the broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.

Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm
NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle
forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial
differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network
(DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point
iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method
within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases
and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the
iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm
Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and
explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near
machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the
consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the
interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These
error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the
integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components
of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme
that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of
the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem
for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.

Abstract: In this work, we present the feedforward neural network based on the
conservative approximation to the derivative from point values, for the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in solving hyperbolic
conservation laws. The feedforward neural network, whose inputs are point
values from the three-point stencil and outputs are two nonlinear weights,
takes the place of the classical WENO weighting procedure. For the training
phase, we employ the supervised learning and create a new labeled dataset for
one-dimensional conservative approximation, where we construct a numerical flux
function from the given point values such that the flux difference approximates
the derivative to high-order accuracy. The symmetric-balancing term is
introduced for the loss function so that it propels the neural network to match
the conservative approximation to the derivative and satisfy the symmetric
property that WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z have in common. The consequent WENO schemes,
WENO3-CADNNs, demonstrate robust generalization across various benchmark
scenarios and resolutions, where they outperform WENO3-Z and achieve accuracy
comparable to WENO5-JS.

Motivation: 现有联邦图神经网络（FGNN）在QoS预测中未能充分利用隐式用户间交互，导致预测准确性不足。

Method: 通过注意力机制放大显式用户-服务图以捕捉高阶协作（隐式用户交互），并采用轻量级消息聚合提升计算效率。

Result: 在两个真实QoS数据集上的实验表明，HC-FGNN具有高预测准确性和隐私保护优势。

Conclusion: HC-FGNN有效解决了现有FGNN的局限性，实现了隐私保护下的高精度QoS预测。

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

Result: 实验表明，ECORE能减少45%能耗和49%延迟，检测精度仅损失2%。

Conclusion: ECORE有效解决了边缘设备上对象检测的能耗与精度平衡问题。

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.

Motivation: 联邦学习在处理分布式数据时面临更新传播延迟的问题，需要更高效的方法来提升模型更新的及时性和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在联邦学习中有效解决了更新延迟问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the
management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent
years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on
additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

Motivation: 标准ESNs性能对超参数和随机初始化敏感，需改进其稳定性和性能。

Method: 使用确定性规则和简单拓扑构建MESNs，并在90多个混沌系统上测试10种初始化方法。

Result: MESNs误差减少41%，稳定性更高，超参数可跨系统复用。

Conclusion: 结构化简单的ESN设计在混沌动力学学习中优于随机复杂性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used to model chaotic systems. Among ML
approaches, echo state networks (ESNs) have received considerable attention due
to their simple construction and fast training. However, ESN performance is
highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and to its random initialization. In
this work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and
simple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic
attractor reconstruction. We use a dataset of more than 90 chaotic systems to
benchmark 10 different minimal deterministic reservoir initializations. We find
that MESNs obtain up to a 41% reduction in error compared to standard ESNs.
Furthermore, we show that the MESNs are more robust, exhibiting less inter-run
variation, and have the ability to reuse hyperparameters across different
systems. Our results illustrate how structured simplicity in ESN design can
outperform stochastic complexity in learning chaotic dynamics.

TL;DR: SUN-VQC是一种变分电路架构，通过限制演化到对称性子群SU(2^k)来避免梯度消失问题，并实现更快的收敛和更高的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决硬件高效变分量子电路中常见的梯度消失问题（barren plateaus），同时保持与近量子处理器的兼容性。

Method: 使用对称性子群SU(2^k)的指数层作为基本构建块，通过广义参数移位规则计算硬件兼容的梯度。

Result: 数值实验显示，SUN-VQC的梯度信号更大，收敛速度快2-3倍，最终保真度更高。

Conclusion: Lie子代数工程为抗梯度消失的变分量子算法提供了一种可扩展且与近量子处理器兼容的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary
layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup,
$\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the
evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than
depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results
demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable
route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum
processors.

Method: 设计基于量子傅里叶变换的电路，利用图的邻接矩阵确定量子比特连接，生成多项式深度的近似电路。

Result: 电路实现了指数级压缩的图信号处理，在基准数据集上的分类结果与基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: 量子电路结合经典神经网络能高效处理图数据，尤其在几何结构显著的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Motivation: 现有研究仅针对最坏情况下的量子态认证，而实例最优的边界在完全纠缠测量情况下尚未解决。

Method: 通过一种新的量子类比方法（Ingster-Suslina方法的量子版本），证明了实例最优的边界。

Result: 证明了最优复制复杂度由最坏情况复杂度与假设态和最大混合态之间的保真度乘积决定。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了开放问题，还简化了混合态测试的下界证明。

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

TL;DR: TuneShield是一个防御框架，用于在LLM微调过程中减少毒性，同时保持对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在定制LLM时，尤其是使用不可信训练数据时，毒性问题的挑战。

Method: 利用LLM的毒性分类能力生成‘治愈数据’，并通过对齐过程优化模型。

Result: TuneShield有效减少毒性攻击，保持对话质量，并抵御自适应攻击。

Conclusion: TuneShield在对抗毒性注入攻击和自适应攻击方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized
conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed
language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user
privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific
extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze
various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct
querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit
transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into
model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,
evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We
propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and
defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with
model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security
professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了N-gram水印在代码中的鲁棒性问题，证明其在代码混淆攻击下无法保持鲁棒性，并提出潜在改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分AI生成代码与人工编写代码对作者归属、内容追踪和滥用检测至关重要，但现有N-gram水印方案在代码混淆攻击下的鲁棒性未充分评估。

Method: 通过形式化建模代码混淆，证明N-gram水印在满足分布一致性的假设下无法保持鲁棒性，并实验验证了三种水印方案、两种LLM、两种编程语言和四种混淆器的效果。

Result: 实验显示所有水印检测器在混淆代码上的检测能力接近随机（AUROC≈0.5），且存在混淆器能使检测AUROC不超过0.6。

Conclusion: N-gram水印在代码混淆攻击下不鲁棒，需探索更鲁棒的代码水印方案。

Abstract: Distinguishing AI-generated code from human-written code is becoming crucial
for tasks such as authorship attribution, content tracking, and misuse
detection. Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as
prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation.
  However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated.
Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code
optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of
robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the
software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters
code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to
protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of
code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the
impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive
and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied.
Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio
that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will
increase to 1 - fpr.
  The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two
LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators.
Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities
on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models,
watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators
that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after
the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also
proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.

Method: 提出新的分类法（内部特征与外部特征），设计两种攻击类型（逃避和伪造攻击），并开发系统攻击策略（解耦、移除、检测等）。

Result: 通过DATABench基准测试评估，发现现有审计方法在对抗性攻击下均表现不佳。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更安全可靠的数据集审计方法以应对对抗性操纵。

Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges
critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the
common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and
copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a
specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising
solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed
various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial
attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a
comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial
perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing
methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the
data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).
Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed
to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely
implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods
and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:
decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based
methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new
benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9
representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal
that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or
distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent
need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable
of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机在于发现并利用KAD框架的设计缺陷，以证明其核心安全前提的无效性。

Method: 通过设计DataFlip攻击方法，无需白盒访问或优化过程，即可利用KAD的结构性漏洞。

Result: 攻击成功率达到88%，而KAD的检测率低至1.5%。

Conclusion: KAD框架存在根本性弱点，需重新设计防御机制以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection
attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly
benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses
based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect
performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In
this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural
vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We
design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this
fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates
as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates
of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any
optimization procedures.

Motivation: 现有FHE GNN方法效率低下，无法实现实时隐私保护推理，DESIGN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DESIGN采用分层优化策略，包括计算加密节点重要性分数、生成多级重要性掩码，并结合自适应多项式激活方案。

Result: 实验表明，DESIGN显著加速FHE GNN推理，同时保持模型准确性。

Conclusion: DESIGN为安全图分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs
in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and
privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN
(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel
framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical
efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook
input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework
achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization
strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance
scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted
graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating
multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated
mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant
elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation
complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy,
presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何利用AI代理自主发现和利用智能合约漏洞，并分析其在攻击与防御中的不对称性。

Method: A1提供六种领域特定工具，代理可自主使用这些工具理解合约行为、生成利用策略、测试并优化。所有输出均经过验证以减少误报。

Result: 在36个真实漏洞合约中，A1成功率为62.96%，提取总金额达933万美元。蒙特卡洛分析显示攻击成功概率为85.9%-88.8%。

Conclusion: A1在漏洞利用中表现出色，但攻击者与防御者的盈利不对称性引发AI代理是否更倾向于利用的伦理问题。

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM
into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and
provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous
vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to
understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on
blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All
outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and
Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the
VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional
vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's
training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59
million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across
six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns
with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations
2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo
analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%
without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying
A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's
o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%
vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to
break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability
rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit
value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about
whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Motivation: 现有漏洞管理方法缺乏对系统设计漏洞状态的系统性分析能力。

Method: 开发了一种形式化基础的自动化推理机制，并集成到开源安全设计工具中。

Result: 通过实际案例展示了该机制如何帮助识别漏洞、指定缓解措施并管理漏洞状态。

Conclusion: 该机制为系统设计师提供了系统性管理漏洞状态的能力。

Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture
and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to
proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security
controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do
not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems
designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we
propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the
mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its
application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges.
The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify
vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly
specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus
systematically manage vulnerability postures.

introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data
synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the
performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even
in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to
concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment
process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to
initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify
characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class
distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using
GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI
tools designed for security tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合匿名化和事件数据分区的管道，通过事件抽象进行分区，以减少匿名化对事件日志效用的损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息系统的事件日志包含敏感信息，匿名化会降低日志的效用，尤其是在复杂日志中。

Method: 提出一个管道，结合匿名化和事件数据分区，利用事件抽象进行分区，使子日志可单独匿名化。

Result: 实验表明，事件分区能提升基于直接跟随关系的匿名化技术在过程发现中的效用。

Conclusion: 事件分区方法在保护隐私的同时，有效减少了匿名化对日志效用的负面影响。

Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event
logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about
customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be
addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for
process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the
higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by
anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization
and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for
partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into
multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This
pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate
our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization
techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery
techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring
improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based
anonymization techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合攻击与防御的框架，利用GAN学习LLM内部的安全判断边界，实现高效的越狱攻击与防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制对恶意查询的防护存在漏洞，需结合攻击与防御提升LLM安全性。

Method: 基于LLM中间层嵌入的线性可分性，利用GAN学习安全判断边界。

Result: 在三个流行LLM上平均越狱成功率为88.85%，防御成功率为84.17%。

Conclusion: 方法有效揭示了LLM内部安全机制，为模型安全增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the
protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods
reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have
isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection
mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.
Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate
layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to
embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize
generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary
inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The
experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak
success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success
rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%.
This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light
on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for
enhancing model security The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨被试的脑机接口算法CSDD，通过提取被试间的共同特征构建通用模型，性能提升3.28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑机接口模型因个体间脑活动差异而适应性差，限制了其泛化性和广泛应用。

Method: 1) 为每个被试训练个性化模型；2) 将个性化模型转化为关系谱；3) 通过统计分析识别共同特征；4) 基于共同特征构建跨被试通用模型。

Result: 在BCIC IV 2a数据集上验证，性能比现有方法提升3.28%。

Conclusion: 首次提出提取纯共同特征并构建跨被试通用模型的方法，推动了脑机接口技术的广泛应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

TL;DR: 传统的新皮层模型认为信息在层级结构中流动，但许多解剖学证据表明新皮层更可能是“异层级”组织。本文提出“千脑理论”，认为每个皮层柱是一个感觉运动学习系统，能够独立学习并识别完整对象。

Motivation: 传统层级模型无法解释新皮层中许多非层级连接和平行响应现象，因此需要新的理论框架。

Method: 提出“千脑理论”，分析皮层柱的学习机制及长程连接的作用，探讨新皮层与丘脑的关系。

Result: 皮层柱能够独立学习并识别完整对象，层级连接用于学习对象的组合结构。丘脑在对象与传感器位姿转换中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 新皮层的“异层级”组织模式对神经科学和人工智能有广泛意义。

Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows
up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex
features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of
connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many
anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical
interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond
in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other
evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at
the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more
suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new
interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the
neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains
Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning
system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a
sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,
can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the
hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional
structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the
theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between
cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these
connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a
heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an
essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel
perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and
artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: 比较FEM和FDM在吉他弦振动模拟中的准确性、可行性和计算时间，结果显示两者误差相近，但FEM在复杂几何中更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨FDM在波形分析中未被广泛使用的原因，并通过实验比较其与FEM的性能。

Method: 使用Python模拟FEM和FDM的吉他弦振动，并与解析解和实验数据对比；FDM还用于分析自行车铃铛的声音。

Result: FEM和FDM误差相近，FEM在复杂几何中收敛更快，FDM计算速度更快但适用性有限。

Conclusion: FEM因其灵活性和易用性仍是工业首选，FDM在某些情况下更快但适用性受限。

Abstract: In many industries, including aerospace and defense, waveform analysis is
commonly conducted to compute the resonance of physical objects, with the
Finite Element Method (FEM) being the standard approach. The Finite Difference
Method (FDM) is seldom used, and this preference is often stated without formal
justification in the literature. In this work, the accuracy, feasibility, and
time of simulation of FEM and FDM are compared by simulating the vibration of a
guitar string. Python simulations for both methods are implemented, and their
results are compared against analytical solutions and experimental data.
Additionally, FDM is applied to analyze the sound of a cycling bell to assess
its reliability compared to a real cycling bell. Final results show that both
FEM and FDM yield similar error margins and accurately predict the system's
behavior. Moreover, the errors from FEM and FDM follow the same periodicity
with a phase shift when varying the assumed analytical tension and without a
phase shift when changing the time interval. However, FEM converges faster with
increasing mesh complexity, whereas FDM demonstrates quicker computational
performance and achieves stable solutions even with bigger time intervals.
Despite this FDM is limited to simpler configurations and often demands
extensive mathematical formulation, which can become cumbersome for intricate
shapes. For example, modeling a hemispherical object using FDM results in
significant simulation times and big calculations. In conclusion, while FDM may
offer faster convergence and computation time in certain cases, FEM remains the
preferred method in industrial contexts due to its flexibility, scalability,
and ease of implementation for complex geometries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间滤波的音频域SRO补偿方法，用于解决无线扬声器时钟偏移对空间音频重现的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线连接的扬声器因独立时钟导致的采样率偏移（SRO）会影响空间音频重现的质量，现有网络协议（如PTP和NTP）对此研究不足。

Method: 通过空间滤波分离扬声器信号，结合原始播放信号估计SRO，并在空间音频重现前进行补偿。

Result: 主观听测和客观指标表明，该方法有效减少了SRO引起的感知退化，保留了空间线索。

Conclusion: 提出的补偿方法能显著改善无线扬声器在空间音频重现中的时钟偏移问题。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in synchronizing wirelessly connected loudspeakers
for spatial audio reproduction is clock skew. Clock skew arises from sample
rate offsets ( SROs) between the loudspeakers, caused by the use of independent
device clocks. While network-based protocols like Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
and Network Time Protocol (NTP) are explored, the impact of SROs on spatial
audio reproduction and its perceptual consequences remains underexplored. We
propose an audio-domain SRO compensation method using spatial filtering to
isolate loudspeaker contributions. These filtered signals, along with the
original playback signal, are used to estimate the SROs, and their influence is
compensated for prior to spatial audio reproduction. We evaluate the effect of
the compensation method in a subjective listening test. The results of these
tests as well as objective metrics demonstrate that the proposed method
mitigates the perceptual degradation introduced by SROs by preserving the
spatial cues.

Motivation: 探索语音和音乐包络跟随响应的频率特性及其在听觉处理和认知中的作用。

Method: 使用时间平均频谱响应和交叉频谱密度分析技术，在头皮四个位置研究系统的传递函数。

Result: 发现α（8-11 Hz）、低γ（53-56 Hz）和高γ（78-81 Hz）波段是系统的峰值响应；交叉频谱密度显示10-13 Hz、27-29 Hz和62-64 Hz是所有通道对的共同频率。

Conclusion: 这些频率响应可能是语音和音乐感知的关键成分，反映了大脑空间神经一致性的主导过程。

Abstract: Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a
crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile,
such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We
have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of
speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes
- is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG
responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the
transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques -
time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency
domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest
that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands
are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant
frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception,
maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The
cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the
human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all
channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these
frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural
processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在语音增强中因多步迭代采样限制了实时应用，而一致性蒸馏虽然提供了一步推理，但容易受教师模型误差影响。

Method: 引入随机学习轨迹和两个时域辅助损失，联合优化一步模型，提升鲁棒性和性能。

Result: 在VoiceBank-DEMAND数据集上实现了54倍加速和优于30步教师模型的性能，并在其他数据集上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: ROSE-CD是首个纯一步一致性蒸馏模型，在语音增强中实现了高效和高质量的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in speech enhancement, but
their real-time applicability has been limited by multi-step iterative
sampling. Consistency distillation has recently emerged as a promising
alternative by distilling a one-step consistency model from a multi-step
diffusion-based teacher model. However, distilled consistency models are
inherently biased towards the sampling trajectory of the teacher model, making
them less robust to noise and prone to inheriting inaccuracies from the teacher
model. To address this limitation, we propose ROSE-CD: Robust One-step Speech
Enhancement via Consistency Distillation, a novel approach for distilling a
one-step consistency model. Specifically, we introduce a randomized learning
trajectory to improve the model's robustness to noise. Furthermore, we jointly
optimize the one-step model with two time-domain auxiliary losses, enabling it
to recover from teacher-induced errors and surpass the teacher model in overall
performance. This is the first pure one-step consistency distillation model for
diffusion-based speech enhancement, achieving 54 times faster inference speed
and superior performance compared to its 30-step teacher model. Experiments on
the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality. Moreover, its
generalization ability is validated on both an out-of-domain dataset and
real-world noisy recordings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR模型在上下文建模和世界知识推理方面能力有限，而大型语言模型（LLMs）和大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的发展为评估ASR系统的通用性和智能性提供了新的可能。

Method: 构建了一个包含40,000条数据、覆盖10多个领域的基准测试ContextASR-Bench，评估模型在有无上下文信息时的表现，并特别分析命名实体识别的能力。

Result: 实验表明，具备世界知识和上下文学习能力的LALMs显著优于传统ASR模型。

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench填补了ASR评估领域的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.

Motivation: 研究发现作家在角色关系设计上存在困难，如难以构想新角色、平衡角色异同及深化关系。

Method: 设计Constella工具，提供FRIENDS DISCOVERY、JOURNALS和COMMENTS功能，支持角色创建与关系深化。

Result: 部署研究表明，Constella能帮助作家创建角色社区、比较角色情感并加深关系理解。

Conclusion: 多代理交互可分散作家注意力，优化角色群体设计。

Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a
critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study
(N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could
influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among
characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these
observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that
supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella
suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner
mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and
manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature).
Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella
enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters,
facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened
writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing
how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort
across the character cast.

Motivation: 现有可视化图表代码重定向过程复杂且耗时，LLMs的自动代码适配能力可能降低这一过程的门槛。

Method: 比较了两种方法：直接生成代码的文本输入法和基于结构信息的程序合成管道法。

Result: 两种方法在数据未适当转换时表现不佳，提出了未来系统的设计建议。

Conclusion: LLMs在可视化重定向中有潜力，但需解决数据转换问题，未来系统设计需优化。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web,
retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains
difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author
familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new
dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be
achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization
retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its
potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM
assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,
categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we
compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully
generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more
constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code
construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual
encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both
approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and
discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.

Motivation: VR环境下用户无法看到现实世界，传统的2FA方法难以实现，因此需要一种新的认证技术。

Method: 提出NRXR-ID技术，通过智能手机完成认证挑战，包括棋盘式挑战和数字PIN输入。采用4X3被试内设计，收集30名参与者的性能数据和用户体验反馈。

Result: 棋盘式视觉匹配挑战表现最佳，其次是智能手机输入数字PIN的挑战。

Conclusion: NRXR-ID为VR环境提供了一种有效的2FA解决方案，棋盘式挑战是最优选择。

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

Abstract: Roll stabilization is a critical aspect of ship motion control, particularly
for vessels operating in low-speed or zero-speed conditions, where traditional
hydrodynamic fins lose their effectiveness. In this paper, we consider a roll
damping system, developed by Navis JSC, based on two actively controlled
zero-speed fins. Unlike conventional fin stabilizers, zero-speed fins employ a
drag-based mechanism and active oscillations to generate stabilizing forces
even when the vessel is stationary. We propose a simple linear control
architecture that, however, accounts for nonlinear drag forces and actuator
limitations. Simulation results on a high-fidelity vessel model used for HIL
testing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which
leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a
promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD)
actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable
deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust
bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble
(an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD
risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment
stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty.
Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and
improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.

### [372] [CORE: Benchmarking LLMs Code Reasoning Capabilities through Static Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05269)
*Danning Xie,Mingwei Zheng,Xuwei Liu,Jiannan Wang,Chengpeng Wang,Lin Tan,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoRe是一个高质量、人工验证的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在静态分析任务中的表现，发现模型在深层语义理解和多步推理方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注端到端结果，而忽略了大语言模型在程序语义推理能力上的评估，因此需要更全面的测试工具。

Method: 提出CoRe基准测试，包含12,553个任务实例，覆盖数据依赖、控制依赖和信息流，采用语义感知的多样化采样策略。

Result: 评估10种主流大语言模型，发现其在依赖识别上表现良好，但在深层语义和多步推理任务中仍有困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了复杂控制结构和反向依赖模式等挑战，为提升大语言模型的代码推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software
engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability
detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code
patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program
elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,
such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models
ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,
a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on
fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning
data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs
written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning
complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects
targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.
We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at
identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative
analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and
backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和模糊测试生成最弱前置条件（WP）的方法，通过模糊测试指导（FG）优化LLMs的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成WP在验证和运行时错误检查等领域有重要应用，但传统方法效率有限。

Method: 引入模糊测试指导（FG），利用模糊测试验证候选WP的有效性和弱性，并将反馈用于优化LLMs的输出。

Result: 在Java确定性数组程序上的实验表明，LLMs能生成可行的候选WP，且FG能显著提升其效果。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和FG的方法能有效生成WP，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of
initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a
given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical
applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz
testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing
Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using
program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking
the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back
to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark
set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs
are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be
practically enhanced through FG.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CorePipe和CoreCodeBench，用于评估大语言模型在工程级代码处理中的表现，解决了现有基准测试的多样性和可控性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估基准在多样性和复杂性上不足，且缺乏对真实工程场景的模拟。

Method: 开发了CorePipe自动化管道生成测试用例，并设计了CoreCodeBench多场景可配置基准测试。

Result: 实验评估了16种大语言模型，揭示了其在工程场景中的不同能力。

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench为评估大语言模型在真实工程项目的适用性提供了全面基准。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The
code for CorePipe is available at
https://github.com/AGI-Eval-Official/CoreCodeBench, and the data for
CoreCodeBench can be accessed at

TL;DR: ASSURE是一个专为AI浏览器扩展设计的自动化测试框架，解决了传统方法无法应对的非确定性行为和复杂环境集成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试方法无法有效评估LLM驱动的浏览器扩展的非确定性和上下文敏感性，导致测试和可靠性保障的空白。

Method: ASSURE包含三个模块：测试用例生成引擎、自动化执行框架和可配置验证管道，专注于行为一致性和安全性验证。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的AI浏览器扩展中，ASSURE发现了531个问题，测试吞吐量比手动方法提高了6.4倍。

Conclusion: ASSURE为AI浏览器扩展的测试提供了高效、全面的解决方案，适合集成到开发流程中。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has
revolutionized web browsing, enabling sophisticated functionalities like
content summarization, intelligent translation, and context-aware writing
assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented
challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension
testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,
context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to
LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate
in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in
effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a
modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered
browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular
test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing
scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex
interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,
and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates
behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact
output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions
demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning
security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content
alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared
to manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4
minutes on average. This efficiency makes ASSURE practical for integration into
development pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution to the unique
challenges of testing AI-powered browser extensions.

TL;DR: OASBuilder是一个框架，将非结构化的API文档转换为机器可读的OpenAPI规范，结合了大型语言模型和基于规则的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线API文档多为非结构化HTML，需手动转换为结构化格式，耗时且低效。

Method: 采用结合大型语言模型和基于规则算法的管道，利用文档网页结构的领域知识。

Result: 实验表明，OASBuilder能处理数百种API，生成有效的OpenAPI规范，涵盖大部分原始文档信息。

Conclusion: OASBuilder在企业环境中成功应用，节省大量手动时间，使复杂API更易于LLM使用。

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web
services require standardized, machine-readable information about their APIs in
the form of API specifications. However, the information about APIs available
online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation,
requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into
a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel
framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into
consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a
carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based
algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of
documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes
well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that
encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder
has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving
thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise
APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

Result: 实验证明TigAug能有效测试模型、高效合成图像且生成图像自然度可接受。

Conclusion: TigAug为解决交通灯检测模型的测试和性能提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

Motivation: 现有LLM测试研究局限于自动生成测试用例（MRs）和单扰动MRs，缺乏对MR选择的优化和组合扰动的覆盖。

Method: 提出搜索过程，实现四种搜索算法（Single-GA、NSGA-II、SPEA2、MOEA/D）优化MR选择，覆盖组合扰动。

Result: MOEA/D算法表现最佳，发现银弹MRs在不同任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM鲁棒性测试提供了优化方法和搜索解决方案的见解。

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing
that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate
the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing
still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization
of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically
generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,
most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in
their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based
approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and
minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the
combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in
the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented
four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel
encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We
conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a
random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our
statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the
MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM
robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM
robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs
across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research
sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides
insights into search-based solutions.

Motivation: 解决太阳耀斑长期预测的挑战，利用机器学习提升预测准确性。

Method: 采用滑动窗口技术和正则化处理时间序列数据，结合LSTM和DLSTM模型及集成算法。

Result: DLSTM在正则化时间序列上表现最优（TSS=0.74，AUC=0.87），能更准确预测大耀斑。

Conclusion: DLSTM分解时间序列能力突出，机器学习在太阳耀斑预测中潜力巨大。

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to
predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog.
The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among
approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified,
highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex,
self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is
employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized
flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare
activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class
imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on
sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while
LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding
windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,
particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)
in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an
ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering
more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models
trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is
attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal
components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the
potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction
and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and
resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

Conclusion: 权重限制校准技术能有效增强经典理论，为伪熵特征提供更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise
demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and
computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization
that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and
non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general
family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon
entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the
characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved
by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational
hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is
that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on
algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability
(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving
pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates
the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic
Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)
and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to
achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet
size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and
Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show
that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for
multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.

Conclusion: ID特征在多模态协同过滤推荐中存在局限性，IDFREE通过无ID设计实现了更优性能。

Abstract: Most existing multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation (MCFRec)
methods rely heavily on ID features and multimodal content to enhance
recommendation performance. However, this paper reveals that ID features are
effective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering
recommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and
cons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic
richness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but
hinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and
fusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these
insights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative
Filtering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal
features and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free
embeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes
an adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and
item-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item
graph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding.
Finally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive
learning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on
three public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based
MCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard
metrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended
experiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in
MCFRec. The code is released at https://github.com/G-H-Li/IDFREE.

TL;DR: LLMs can automate metadata maintenance for text-based data, generating high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata comparable to human efforts, with larger models and few-shot prompting performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data exploration is time-consuming due to manual metadata creation. The study explores if LLMs can automate this process efficiently.

Method: Tested zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies with various LLMs, including a fine-tuned model for classification.

Result: LLMs generate metadata comparable to human efforts, with larger models and few-shot prompting outperforming others. Fine-tuning improves classification accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a faster, reliable metadata creation method, but task-specific criteria and domain context must be carefully considered.

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important
for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business
models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable
data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.
Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to
answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a
manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study
investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data
and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and
few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating
metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for
classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to
human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic
understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning
significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields
better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to
create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of
task-specific criteria and domain context.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）生成的虚假信息具有自我强化、高度可信和多语言快速传播的特点，传统检测方法难以有效应对，亟需主动防御策略。

Result: 主动防御策略在虚假信息预防上比传统方法提升63%，但存在计算开销和泛化挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注知识基础、推理认证和抗攻击接口的协同设计，以提升LLM在多领域的虚假信息防御能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key
technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation
sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and
exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,
have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This
paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path
recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach
reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's
historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common
features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,
along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant
recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the
recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the
proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path
recommendation.

### [387] [News Source Citing Patterns in AI Search Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05301)
*Kai-Cheng Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AI搜索系统的新闻引用行为研究显示，不同提供商的模型引用新闻来源有共同模式，但存在明显的自由派偏见。用户满意度不受新闻来源政治倾向或质量影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI搜索系统的新闻引用行为，填补现有文献中对这些系统引用模式理解的空白。

Method: 通过分析AI Search Arena平台的数据，包括24,000次对话和65,000条回答，研究366,000次引用中的新闻来源。

Result: 新闻引用集中在少数媒体，存在自由派偏见，但低可信度来源较少被引用。用户满意度与新闻来源的政治倾向或质量无关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI搜索系统在新闻引用行为上的挑战，对其设计和治理具有重要意义。

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,
fundamentally transforming how users access news and information. Despite their
growing influence, the citation patterns of these systems remain poorly
understood. We address this gap by analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, a
head-to-head evaluation platform for AI search systems. The dataset comprises
over 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models across three major
providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PLACE是一种创新的图提示学习框架，用于属性社区搜索（ACS），通过插入可学习的提示令牌增强图结构，提升查询效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受NLP中提示调优的启发，旨在通过提示令牌增强图结构，以更有效地识别与查询相关的结构凝聚性和属性相似性模式。

Method: PLACE将结构和可学习的提示令牌集成到图中，形成提示增强图，采用交替训练范式优化提示参数和GNN，并设计分治策略提升可扩展性。

Result: 在9个真实世界图上进行实验，PLACE在三种ACS查询中平均F1分数比现有最优方法高22%。

Conclusion: PLACE通过提示学习显著提升了属性社区搜索的效果，适用于大规模图处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community
Search), an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS. Enlightened by
prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt
tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural
and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement
mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph
structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens
connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more
effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute
similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training
paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover,
we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the
model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world
graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries,
where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts
on average.

Abstract: Biomedical semantic question answering rooted in information retrieval can
play a crucial role in keeping up to date with vast, rapidly evolving and
ever-growing biomedical literature. A robust system can help researchers,
healthcare professionals and even layman users access relevant knowledge
grounded in evidence. The BioASQ 2025 Task13b Challenge serves as an important
benchmark, offering a competitive platform for advancement of this space. This
paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this
challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can
answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and
snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense
embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an
ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for
re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10
of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer
generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our
system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of
0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal
answers (rank 11).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到高质量嵌入在嵌入空间中占据几何稳定的区域并表现出一致的邻域结构。

Method: 结合量化鲁棒性和邻域密度指标，预测检索性能。

Result: 在4个标准检索数据集上，Recall@10提升了9.4±1.2%，计算开销低于检索时间的5%。

Conclusion: 框架揭示了不同查询类型中嵌入质量的系统性模式，为针对性训练数据增强提供了见解。

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐系统中缺乏领域知识和协同信号，而SASRec能捕捉长期用户偏好，两者结合可弥补各自不足。

Method: 提出SASRecLLM框架，将SASRec作为协同编码器与LoRA微调的LLM结合，通过映射层对齐维度，并设计三种训练策略优化。

Result: 在多数据集实验中，SASRecLLM在冷启动和热启动场景下均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SASRecLLM为LLM-based推荐提供了模块化且有效的融合范式，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures
long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical
interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their
powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs
often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential
for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To
address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that
integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to
align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are
designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements
over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work
advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and
effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the
semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:

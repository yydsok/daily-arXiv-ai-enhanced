This paper introduces a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing\nprinciples of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes\nnarrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language\nModels (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns,\nwhile a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories.\nA multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these\ninformation types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-),\nthe MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap\n(relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic\ndevelopments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis\nand semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a\ngraphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's\nnarrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying\nAnthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual\nparatexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping\narcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory\nconsolidation versus human holistic understanding. This memory-centric approach\nhighlights the potential of combining AI-driven memory processing with human\nexpertise. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats\nwhere narrative is entirely text-based. Future work will focus on integrating\nmultimodal inputs to enrich episodic memory, refining memory integration\nmechanisms within the MAS, and expanding testing across diverse genres.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u89c6\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f27\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7535\u89c6\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f27\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5b58\u50a8\u60c5\u8282\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u300a\u5b9e\u4e60\u533b\u751f\u683c\u857e\u300b\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f27\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\u5f27\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u6269\u5c55\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

In\nspite of this, advancements in technology have resulted in breaches of privacy\nand data security. When it comes to protecting private information in today's\nInternet era, digital steganography is vital. Many academics are interested in\ndigital video because it has a great capability for concealing important data.\nThere have been a vast number of video steganography solutions developed lately\nto guard against the theft of confidential data. The visual imperceptibility,\nrobustness, and embedding capacity of these approaches are all challenges that\nmust be addressed. In this paper, a novel solution to reversible video\nsteganography based on DWT and QR codes is proposed to address these concerns.\nIn order to increase the security level of the suggested method, an enhanced\nElGamal cryptosystem has also been proposed. Prior to the embedding stage, the\nsuggested method uses the modified ElGamal algorithm to encrypt secret QR\ncodes. Concurrently, it applies two-dimensional DWT on the Y-component of each\nvideo frame resulting in LL, LH, HL, and HH sub-bands. Then, the encrypted Low\n(L), Medium (M), Quantile (Q), and High (H) QR codes are embedded into the HL\nsub-band, HH sub-band, U-component, and V-component of video frames,\nrespectively, using the LSB technique. As a consequence of extensive testing of\nthe approach, it was shown to be very secure and highly invisible, as well as\nhighly resistant to attacks from Salt & Pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, and Speckle\nnoises, which has an average SSIM of more than 0.91.

However,\ntruly parallel ASR decoding remains challenging due to the sequential nature of\nautoregressive (AR) decoders and the context limitations of non-autoregressive\n(NAR) methods. While modern ASR encoders can process up to 30 seconds of audio\nat once, AR decoders still generate tokens sequentially, creating a latency\nbottleneck. We propose Whisfusion, the first framework to fuse a pre-trained\nWhisper encoder with a text diffusion decoder. This NAR architecture resolves\nthe AR latency bottleneck by processing the entire acoustic context in parallel\nat every decoding step. A lightweight cross-attention adapter trained via\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges the two modalities.

This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.\n  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model\nto predict these strategies for use during gameplay.

This work rejects that premise. It\nproposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric\nconsequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in\nbiological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival\nManifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature\ngeodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A\nsurvival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is\nintroduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric\nflow stability.

Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily\nfocus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often\noverlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these\nmethods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency\nbut incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,\na unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait\nanimation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate\nbranches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,\nhead poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic\nemotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that\ndecouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,\nusing these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of\nresults, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip\nsynchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background\ndetails. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms\nof lip synchronization and speaking style controllability.

Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal\ninteraction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context\nin cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on\nleveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for\ncross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample\nrelationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the\ncross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal\nretrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample\nmodality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference\ncontext to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a\ncontrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples\nand enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample\nand intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts,\nmodality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and\nsample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal\nretrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and\nsample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality.

However,\ntraditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,\noften overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for\nlearning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN\nutilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships\nand combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable\nmamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction\nmethods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the\nconnections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's\nrepresentational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we\nincorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature\npropagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly\nintroduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nHGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node\nclassification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods.

We validate our approach\nthrough real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs,\nand mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the\nfabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and\nmeasured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived\nadhesive design.

In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a\nreal-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object\ndetection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation.

We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and\ntesting labels in lane line segmentation.

The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing\nEvaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative\ncategories according to category-level statistics, \\textit{e.g.}, category\nfrequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of\nLVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing\nobject hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that\noverlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative\nobject categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination\nsearching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate\nthe most misleading distractors (\\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or\nincorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which\nserves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To\nexplore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination\nsearching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to\napproximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with\nthe highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of\nhallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching\nconstructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false\ndescriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of\nat least 9\\% and up to 23\\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,\nsignificantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities.

However, evaluating the fidelity of such\ngenerated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches\nhave attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical\nconstraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and\nphysical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of\nhuman perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven\nmetric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This\nmethod evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications\nneeded for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are\nable to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that\nserve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,\na novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of\nhuman motion.

They provide both structural and functional information about the\nrelationships that are present in the system. The structural information\noutlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional\ninformation describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned\nmodels. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while\naccounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more\nrobust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using\nsignificantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common\nmodel-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage\nthe sparsity of interactions in robotic systems.

We validate our method using manipulators and mobile\nrobots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the\nlearned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and\nchanges in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world\nrobotics scenarios.

Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is\nbased primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,\nthe early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,\nhas become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of\nuser-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate\nextraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data\nacross multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal\ndepression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal\nhigh-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer\nnetwork with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a\ntransformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in\naudio.

This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to\nlanguage-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the\nGlobal Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a\nlanguage-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs\nas the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action\nspaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We\nfirst explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in\nremote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,\nincluding unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and\nreasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global\nworkspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered\nsolutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research\ndirections from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task\nunderstanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and\nautonomous interaction.

This paper presents a scalable framework\nto automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American\nIncarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,\nevaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in\nhistorically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts.

In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number\nof agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple\ncoexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that\nperforms explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct\nlevels.

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.

While traditional human driver\nsimulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting\naway the very complexity that defines human driving.

Meanwhile, depending on the error\ntype, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically\nindirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the\ngeneration of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models\neach error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we\nintroduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by\nconnecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this\nframework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding\nhuman-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.\nWith this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided\nmethods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs).

However, label errors, defined as missing labels,\nincorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the\nquality of these datasets.

Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to\ncorrect such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open\nproblem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction\ncalled REC$\\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the\nframework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced\nmicrotasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each\ncandidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate\nambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nREC$\\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our\ncrowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a\nrate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original\nannotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark\nfor label error detection and correction. We show that current label error\ndetection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover\nhundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes\nfrom scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true\nerrors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions.

Despite the ever-improving capabilities\nof large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in\nconversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing\ndialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which\noutperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and\nbillion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of\nresponses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is\nto train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score\nduring training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use\nnoun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores\nas a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark\ndatasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training\nallows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent\ndialogues.

We evaluate five\nrecently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along\nvarious demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and\nsocio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about\ndoubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings.

These factors create asymmetric\npower relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.\nThe paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism\nin ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce\nproblematic language ideologies.

We\nexplore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two\nteams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign\ndata and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the\nperformance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The\nblue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to\nidentify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue\nteam strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated\ngradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by\nthe red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods\n(100\\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the\nother techniques yield more varied performance.

Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from\n1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like\nGPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema\nlineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting\ntechniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,\ncan achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.\nThis finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying\nschema-aware agents in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u811a\u672c\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86SLiCE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdRAG\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6e90\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6e90\u8868\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165SLiCE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c32B\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1GPT\u7cfb\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF),\nparticularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or\nforecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to\ndeal with.

However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios\ninvolving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies\naddress 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate\nperformance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,\nmost existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human\nor clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To\nbridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark\ndataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and\nshape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed\nthis dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,\nincorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and\nhuman motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and\nBEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the\ntest split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance\nhuman detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object\ndetector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system\nunder occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for\nfuture research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,\noffering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets.

Recent single-stage\nmethods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled\nmechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we\nreframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \\textbf{implicit\nrewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary\nreward signals. We introduce \\textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel\nsingle-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,\npath-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is\na \\textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL\nbalance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize\nlong-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by\npolicy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training\ncurriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks\nspanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points),\nand vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution\n(OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the\nmeta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency,\nand performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM\nalignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SFT+RL\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6a21\u4eff\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMFT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5143\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316SFT\u548cRL\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAMFT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OOD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AMFT\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861SFT\u548cRL\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),\na novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action\nunderstanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion\ntasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting\nmasked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,\nidentifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating\ndescriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.\nThese tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with\nwell-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization\nand semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches, achieving a 7.1\\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B\nmodel compared to Time-R1.

While deep\nconvolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection\nto near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise\nlocalization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications\nwhere millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis\nof ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector\nthat adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images\n(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level\nsemantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward\nrefinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.\nWe further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D\nslice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational\nefficiency.

Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile\nsubtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,\nbubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support\ndownstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet\ninspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic\ntumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that\npreserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream\naggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The\nstreams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject\nhigh frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel\nattention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic\nappearance.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply\ncontext to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use\nabilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive\ndatasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse\nformats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the\ndifficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks\nwith high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the\nsuccess rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across\ndifferent MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the\nnumber of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the\ntextual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an\nLLM to process all at once.

Project website: https://zl-tian.github.io/MoRoCo/", "summary": "Fleets of autonomous robots are increasingly deployed alongside multiple\nhuman operators to explore unknown environments, identify salient features, and\nperform complex tasks in scenarios such as subterranean exploration,\nreconnaissance, and search-and-rescue missions. In these contexts,\ncommunication is often severely limited to short-range exchanges via ad-hoc\nnetworks, posing challenges to coordination. While recent studies have\naddressed multi-robot exploration under communication constraints, they largely\noverlook the essential role of human operators and their real-time interaction\nwith robotic teams. Operators may demand timely updates on the exploration\nprogress and robot status, reprioritize or cancel tasks dynamically, or request\nlive video feeds and control access. Conversely, robots may seek human\nconfirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or\nplanning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under\nrestricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for\nonline coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.\nMoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:\nspread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,\nmigrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining\nhigh-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links. These transitions are\nmanaged through distributed algorithms via only local communication. Extensive\nlarge-scale human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments validate the\nnecessity of incorporating human robot interactions and demonstrate that MoRoCo\nenables efficient, reliable coordination under limited communication, marking a\nsignificant step toward robust human-in-the-loop multi-robot autonomy in\nchallenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRoCo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u3001\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08spread\u3001migrate\u3001chain\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e92\u52a8\u9700\u6c42\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u800cMoRoCo\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "MoRoCo\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08spread\u3001migrate\u3001chain\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u672c\u5730\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MoRoCo\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRoCo\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model.

Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

The only link between the robot and the crane is\nthe interaction force produced during the guiding of the payload. Two\nadmittance transfer functions are considered to accomplish harmless and smooth\ncontact with the payload. The first is used in a position-based admittance\ncontrol integrated with the robot. The second one adds compliance to the crane\nby processing the interaction force through the admittance transfer function to\ngenerate a crane's velocity command that makes the crane follow the payload.\nThen the robot's end-effector and the crane move collaboratively to guide the\npayload to the desired location.

We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression.

In this paper, through analyzing\nthe problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from\nnoise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature\npyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature\npurification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into\nthe original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by\npurifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of\nnoise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse\ntarget-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to\nbe lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS\nframeworks.

In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly\navailable for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks\nto be scaled with QE capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALOPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574Transformer\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08QE\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684QE\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "ALOPE\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08LoRA\uff09\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u5934\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u591a\u5934\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "ALOPE\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM-based QE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "ALOPE\u4e3aLLM-based QE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The\nprimary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from\ntip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a\ncapsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the\nuneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is\nanalyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable\norientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations.

Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,\nalthough large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task\nplanning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to\ntabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited\nactuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies\nexhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object\nconfigurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for\npractical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform\nmaneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings\nremains understudied.\n  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for\nagile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates\nhigh-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the\nchallenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce\na hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling\nlong-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the\ncontrol level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across\nchallenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon\nmobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios.

We evaluate performance under varying fields of view\n(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between\nperipheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of\nview (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable\nacross all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200\ndegree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which\noften fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy\nusing UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although\nUniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that\nenable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with\nfog, glare, or sky.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL.

Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle\nto achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document\nstructures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main\ninsight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),\ndewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a\none-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.\nFirstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic\nprocess that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a\nlightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to\naddress the geometric distortion of document images.

In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to\nproduce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a\nmathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by\noff-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions\noften leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the\nnumerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established\noptimization solvers.

To compensate for the deficiency of\nrobot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with\nlarge-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from\nrobotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future\nframes at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under\ninsufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale\nhuman action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions\nfrom hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical\nReasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action\nvideos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,\nenabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human\nhand keypoints.

Our results\ndemonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction\naccuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final\nmodel achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge,\nwith out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the\nbaseline model used in the selection phase.

However, this task remains challenging due to low\ncontrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct\nboundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for\nFusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp\nsegmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph\nConvolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and\ntopological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables\nthe model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging\ntopological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw\nimage intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and\ndelineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused\nstand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context\nintegration.

The Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse\nactivation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The\npresence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe\ndegradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,\nsignificantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,\nefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to\nbalance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)\nand CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian\nmatrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and\nweights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers\nwhile ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we\ndesign an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,\ncombined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment\nand scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory\nfootprint and inference latency.

We consider two such priors on the rewards: 1) rewards are mostly\nconstant and they change infrequently, 2) rewards can be represented by a\nlinear combination of a small number of feature functions. We first show that\nthe reward identification problem with the former prior can be recast as a\nsparsification problem subject to linear constraints.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art\ngenerative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models\n(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:\nAtelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged\nCardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the\nMIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a\nreader study with three radiologists of varied experience.

However, their\ndependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of\npretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world\napplications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment\nLearning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that\nefficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large\nHVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on\nthree typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape\npattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable\nlightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting\nas a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized\nexperts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on\nboth input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of\nalignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between\nlightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and\ninstance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL\neffectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns\nfrom large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the DPAL.

To enforce\nnorms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics\nmethods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly\nappealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art\ndetectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called\nGenerative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900\nstudent-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various\ndomains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we\npropose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution\nto a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to\nslightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to\nactive attacks on the detector by \"humanizing\" generated texts.

In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings.

Current RVOS methods view referring\nexpressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic\nstructure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to\nimage-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and\nobject-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event\nattributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges\ntraditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose\nthe Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS\ninto object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization\nphase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which\nare then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to\nexchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR\nextracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into\nhighly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted\ndirected acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose\nTemporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of\neach temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node.

Specifically, CMB-Net\nutilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within\nimages and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack\nof semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the\nerroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of\nIML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns\nweights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and\nimage features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.\nWe also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and\ntext features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,\ninspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder\n(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary\ninformation in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show\nthat CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CMB-Net\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u7be1\u6539\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7559\u4e0b\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5206\u6790\u7be1\u6539\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u5757\uff08ITCAM\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08ITIM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6062\u590d\u8fb9\u7f18\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08RED\uff09\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCMB-Net\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u591a\u6570\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "CMB-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative\ndecoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch\nsizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eEAGLE\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Llama\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6811\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7b49\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9Llama\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecEAGLE\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u5757NVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0cLlama4 Maverick\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fbe\u5230\u6bcftoken\u7ea64\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb10%\uff1bEAGLE\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u4e0b\u63d0\u901f1.4x\u81f32.0x\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Llama\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5237\u65b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002"}}

Our\nperturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal\nlearning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target\ndensity only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models.\nFurther, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the\nsupport? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive\ninfinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the\nboundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient\ncondition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment.\nMoreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for\nrobust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the\ntangent bundle of the data manifold.

For SFT data, our experiments show that a\nsmall number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large\nnumber of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better\nresults without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues\nwith current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical\nexploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories.

We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a\nmeasurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior\n$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)\nunder well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular\nalgorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and\nreconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional\nassumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is\ntractable, we view this as a more general \"tilting\" problem of biasing a\ndistribution towards a measurement.

We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety\ndimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.\nAdditionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language\ndataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,\nderived from real-world online discourse.

NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,\nwhich are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and\nnewly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding\nmeteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make\nspatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To\nhandle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,\nstructure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural\ninformation loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges.

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be\nretrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one\npossible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the\nsemantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.\nSemantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic\nsimilarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:\none must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached\nresponses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities\nand serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time.

In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model. We formulate the server-client interaction as a\ntwo-stage Stackelberg game, where the server, as the leader, optimizes\nincentive policies, and clients, as followers, strategically select their\nprivacy budgets, which determine their privacy-preserving levels by controlling\nthe magnitude of added noise. To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium.

With the development of Large\nReasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning\nduring test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to\nthe scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform\npoorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of\nreasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we\nfirst propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis\nframework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and\napplies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A\nself-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data\nquality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we\nfurther propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a\nreinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement.\nDuring the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a\nmulti-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based\nreward.

Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance.

Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data.

In\nthis paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,\nEvidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO).

To\naddress these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image\nCaptioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text\nretrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images.

To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and\nefficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts\nremoval. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing\nsemantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully\nleveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a\nsemantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features\nfrom low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space\nsemantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it\npreserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we\npropose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the\ncompression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the\noptimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive\nexperimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in\nboth visual quality and quantitative metrics.

The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a\ncollection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given\nviews of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of\nmany views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input\nviews are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps.

However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,\noptimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that\nfails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages.

In this paper, we show that highly\ntransferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,\nwithout accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly\ndegrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a\nunified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the\nadversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack\nmethods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level\nforgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

Despite\nnotable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant\nchallenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to\ndynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations\nrelated to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as\ninefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in\nscenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper,\nwe introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple,\nscalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address\nthese challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model\nthat enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows,\neffectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller\narchitectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios.

To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using\nstructural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned\nperceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the\nUSAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the\ndevelopment of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and\nenhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the\nBlender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality\nnovel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My\ninvestigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original\nground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting.

The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian\nSplatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve\nphotogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions.

Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong\nperformance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.\nIn addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and\ntopological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building\non these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which\ncombines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling.

This paradigm has recently been extended to\nfederated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively\ntrain prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security\nimplications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning\nremain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In\nthis paper, we introduce \\textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack\ntargeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models.

However, their effectiveness is limited when\nrelying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex\nstructures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two\ncomplementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological\nrelationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second\nemphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image\nview. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.\nTo leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes\n(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view\nintegration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly\nresampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids\nexcessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy\nexpansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's\nself-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the\nquality of the generated prefixes.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)\naddresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during\ninference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods\nexploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of\nlow-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to\nout-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical\nchallenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution\nshifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded\nadaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to\naccommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal\npredictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache\nEnhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively\nstoring high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by\ndynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and\niteratively refined using an exponential moving average and\nexploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise\ndecision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse\nvisual distributions.

In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to\nExplanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,\nand narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable\nand accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a\ndeepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual\ncaptioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated\nregions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving\nframework for collaborative training, but standard aggregation methods like\nFederated Averaging (FedAvg) can be biased by dominant datasets in\nheterogeneous settings. This paper investigates FL for seizure prediction using\na single EEG channel across four diverse public datasets (Siena, CHB-MIT,\nHelsinki, NCH), representing distinct patient populations (adult, pediatric,\nneonate) and recording conditions. We implement privacy-preserving global\nnormalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each\nclient trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring\nequal contribution during aggregation.

Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM\nsignificantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while\nthe SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with\ngreatly reduced complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u901a\u9053\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff08CKM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5SM-IB\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\uff08IRS\uff09\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u4fe1\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea7\u8054\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LPS-Net\u548cSE-Net\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u94fe\u8def\u529f\u7387\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5SM-IB\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u795e\u7ecfCKM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0cSM-IB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86IRS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees.

We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions.

Our method\nleverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D\nrepresentations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA\naccurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme\nleads to a 22.18\\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk.

We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the\nreliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and\ntrusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted\nAcc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The\nproposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the\nmodel with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The\nextensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,\nachieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other\nmethods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511\nand 0.9035, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TER\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u8861\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "TER\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u503c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u679c\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u4fe1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7b49\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "TER\u5728Music-video\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe82.40%\uff0c\u5728IEMOCAP\u548cMusic-video\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.7511\u548c0.9035\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "TER\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Extensive\nexperiments on both offline and online A/B tests validate GBS's effectiveness.\nMoreover, GBS has been deployed on the Meituan DSP platform, serving billions\nof bid requests daily.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGBS\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6295\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u5269\u4f59\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u6295\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6295\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5cf0\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u51f8\u5269\u4f59\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "GBS\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6b8b\u5dee\u751f\u6210\u8c03\u6574\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff1b(2) \u5956\u52b1\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CHNet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5269\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GBS\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u7f8e\u56e2DSP\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u5904\u7406\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u6295\u6807\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "GBS\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6295\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, their sequential nature leads to long inference\ntimes, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped\nSpeculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR\nimage models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a\nmeans to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only\nmodest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis\nreveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image\ntokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can\nconvey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept\nonly a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,\nleading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a\nnew SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than\nrelying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static\nclustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our\ndynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image\nmodels by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without\nrequiring any additional training.

Consequently,\nreference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their\ncorresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a\npromising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference\nsegmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still\nnecessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and\ncomputational cost.

Consequently, the visual-semantic\nmapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to\nunseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning\nframework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through\na Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level\nimprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module.

We propose modeling trajectories of noisy\npose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and\ngeometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential\nEquations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths.

Our approach is easily integrated as a module in\nexisting pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical\nparameters.

In materials science, to find novel\nmaterials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world\napplications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and\nexperiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space,\nminimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide\nan accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the\nintegration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials\nstructures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge\nfrom literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG\nin accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic\nreview to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key\nmaterials science problems.

However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,\nas their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these\ndefenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.\nThis means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their\nmodels, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense\nnot only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,\nwhich occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To\nachieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).\nBenefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the\nframework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.\nFirst, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a\npoisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an\nattacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to\nprevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus\nensuring the defense remains effective long-term.

We conduct a comprehensive\nstudy on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the\ndense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for\nquality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while\ntraditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low\ncontrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and\ndrive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine\nbattery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world\nvisual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an\nintelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted\npre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate\nPBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed\nto extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,\nline, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination\nbetween plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state\nspace modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive\nrelationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware\nreordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.\nIn addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide\nrobust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode\npositions.

To improve\ncomputational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the\nensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function\ndesigned for real-time inference.

However, existing\nvision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder\ntheir practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,\nmanifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,\nlimited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term\nsequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained\ncontrol over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present\nBeing-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our\napproach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human\nmotion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion\nsequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed\npart-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We\nintroduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion\ntokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts\nduring generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's\nsuperior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive\nefficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions\ninclude design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future\ndevelopment of practical motion generators.

Although this improves\nvisual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image\ntokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly\nincrease inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this\nissue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These\nmethods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most\nof them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context\nlearning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.\nRedundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain\nadaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in\nthis setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need\nfor new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning\n(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP\nconsists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for\nthe complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence.

Weakly supervised affordance\ngrounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person\ndemonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing\npixel-level annotations.

However, since\naffordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models\nprimarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific\npatterns that are unrelated to affordance.

Most existing video matting datasets provide only\nhuman-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be\ncomposited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the\ngeneralization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is\ntypically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two\nperspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by\npursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also\ndevelop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse\nhuman bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a\n3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting\napproach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video\ndiffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong\npriors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and\nreal-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video\nmatting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal\ninformation, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong\ntemporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across\nthree benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,\nand present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,\nillustrating the strong generalization capability of our method.

Recent memory-based methods enable efficient\nonline reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand\nDilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the\nlong-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity\ndetail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing\nmethods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static\nstructures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To\naddress this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the\nmodeling of static geometry and dynamic motion.

However, existing RS VQA datasets are\nconstrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the\nassessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA\ndataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.\nRSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS\nsegmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ\nan innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed\nprompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including\nimage captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex\ncaption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object\ncounting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that\nextracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1\nthen formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired\nwith preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises\n13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and\ndiverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the\ndataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the\nsuperior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct\nbenchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),\ndemonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the\nunderstanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain.

Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large\nface datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.\nHowever, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in\nmultiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates\ndatabase management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face\nfor dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising\nsignificant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a\nnovel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.\nFirst, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to\nsecurely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it\nproposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training\ndata storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial\nrecognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve\nthe privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while\nensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also\nenables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their\npersonal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that\nVOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and\nprivacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance.

While\nAxiom C was dismissed in the past due to its association with modal collapse,\nwe show that the collapse only arises under classical and bivalent assumptions,\nand specifically in the presence of Axiom T. Hence we avoid Axiom T and adopt a\nparacomplete semantic framework, grounded in Weak Kleene logic or Description\nLogic, where undefined propositions coexist with modal assertions.

Although significant effort has been spent\nstudying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little\nwork to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar\ncycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995,\nleaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian\ndeep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach\nby applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period\nbetween 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric\nTelescope.

A critical step is to learn\nclass-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability\neffectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to\nlearn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause\ndue to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats\nclass-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,\nand a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is\ncapable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of\nmedical images.

The previously developed\nMultimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two\nindependent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)\nand a time-series module.

By\nconstructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose\nweights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and\ncluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an\noptimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final\nprediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset.

Specifically, the framework classifies\nresearch orientations according to ontological, epistemological,\nmethodological, teleological, axiological, and valorization dimensions. Our\nfindings show a predominance of perspectives aligned with critical realism\n(ontological), positivism (epistemological), analytical methods\n(methodological), consequentialism (teleological), epistemic values\n(axiological), and social/economic valorization. Less common stances, such as\nidealism, mixed methods, and cultural valorization, are also examined for their\npotential to enrich knowledge production.

We argue that, although both interventions pose risks\nof unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising\npathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by\npreserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f03\u6743\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6469\u64e6\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u6b67\u89c6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u534f\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f03\u6743\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6469\u64e6\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u4fe1\u8d37\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u4f55\u89e6\u53d1\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f03\u6743\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u5316\u548c\u8c28\u614e\u51b3\u7b56\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5747\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u82f1\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u4e3a\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, the robustness of these watermarking\ntechniques against potential attacks remains underexplored. This paper\nintroduces the first universal black-box attack framework, the Group-based\nMulti-objective Evolutionary Attack (GMEA), designed to challenge these\nwatermarking systems. We formulate the attack as a large-scale multi-objective\noptimization problem, balancing watermark removal with visual quality. In a\nblack-box setting, we introduce an indirect objective function that blinds the\nwatermark detector by minimizing the standard deviation of features extracted\nby a convolutional network, thus rendering the feature maps uninformative.

To enable efficient adaptation between the source and\nchannel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as\nfunctions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic\nregression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E\ndistortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power\nallocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex\napproximation.

Much of this literature\nfocuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought\nexperiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the\nmost immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called\nstreet-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social\nresources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how\nprinciples of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization\nmechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments\nalign with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined\nvulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness\nresource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services\n(maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to\nperform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely\ninconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different\nLLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time,\nLLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise\ntesting.

We break away from the typical generative approach that learns\nfrom a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness.

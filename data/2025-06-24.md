### [1] [Evaluating Generalization and Representation Stability in Small LMs via Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17289)
*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较小语言模型在少样本提示和监督微调下的泛化能力，分析其在分布内和分布外设置中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示和微调在低资源环境中的鲁棒性，为模型选择提供实践指导。

Method: 比较提示和微调在不同任务格式、提示风格和模型规模下的表现，分析内部表示。

Result: 发现不同适应策略下模型内部化和泛化知识的显著差异。

Conclusion: 为低数据环境下的模型选择提供依据，并丰富提示与微调的实证讨论。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

### [2] [Individual Causal Inference with Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17300)
*Daniel T. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构因果模型（SCM）的个体因果推断（ICI）方法，通过个体化操作符（indiv(W)）和个体因果查询（P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)）来估计个体因果效应（ICE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推断方法多为基于群体的，难以直接应用于个体层面。本文旨在利用SCM中的外生变量（U）编码个体差异，实现个体化的因果推断。

Method: 提出个体化操作符（indiv(W)）和个体因果查询（P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)），将SCM用于个体因果推断，强调对个体可能性的推断而非反事实。

Result: 展示了如何通过SCM实现个体因果推断，并指出其适用于个体可能性而非反事实。

Conclusion: 基于SCM的个体因果推断为个体化干预效果估计提供了新方法，扩展了因果推断的应用范围。

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

### [3] [Resource Rational Contractualism Should Guide AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17434)
*Sydney Levine,Matija Franklin,Tan Zhi-Xuan,Secil Yanik Guyot,Lionel Wong,Daniel Kilov,Yejin Choi,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Noah Goodman,Seth Lazar,Iason Gabriel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出资源理性契约主义（RRC），通过启发式方法高效模拟多方理性协议，以解决AI在复杂人类环境中的决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI需在目标与价值观多元的人类环境中决策，传统契约主义达成协议成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用资源理性契约主义框架，结合规范基础和认知启发式方法，平衡效率与准确性。

Result: RRC框架使AI能高效运作并动态适应人类社会的复杂变化。

Conclusion: RRC为AI在多元环境中提供了一种高效且适应性强的决策方法。

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

### [4] [Keeping Medical AI Healthy: A Review of Detection and Correction Methods for System Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17442)
*Hao Guan,David Bates,Li Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了医疗AI系统在长期部署中性能退化的原因、检测方法及修正策略，旨在提升其可靠性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在动态临床环境中可能因数据分布变化、患者特征变化等因素导致性能退化，亟需持续监控和修正机制。

Method: 回顾性能退化的常见原因，总结数据与模型漂移检测技术，分析根因，并探讨从模型重训练到测试时适应的修正策略。

Result: 综述了传统机器学习模型和大型语言模型的优劣势，提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 为开发可靠、鲁棒的医疗AI系统提供了指导，支持其在动态临床环境中的长期安全部署。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

### [5] [OmniReflect: Discovering Transferable Constitutions for LLM agents via Neuro-Symbolic Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17449)
*Manasa Bharadwaj,Nikhil Verma,Kevin Ferreira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniReflect是一个分层、反思驱动的框架，通过构建指导原则（constitution）提升LLM代理的性能，在动态环境中表现高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如微调和自我修正）缺乏长期学习的通用机制，且在动态环境中效率低下。

Method: OmniReflect采用两种模式：自我维持（单个代理定期反思）和协作（Meta-advisor从校准集生成指导原则）。结合神经、符号和神经符号技术。

Result: 在ALFWorld、BabyAI和PDDL任务中，自我维持模式分别提升10.3%、23.8%和8.3%；协作模式中轻量级Qwen3-4B代理优于所有基线。

Conclusion: OmniReflect在多种环境和模型上表现稳健高效。

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

### [6] [Bayesian Social Deduction with Graph-Informed Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17788)
*Shahab Rahimirad,Guven Gergerli,Lucia Romero,Angela Qian,Matthew Lyle Olson,Simon Stepputtis,Joseph Campbell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合推理框架，结合结构化概率模型和LLM，显著提升了语言模型在社交推理任务中的表现，并在Avalon游戏中击败了人类玩家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在社交推理任务中表现有限，尤其是在小型实时模型上表现不佳，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用混合推理框架，外部化信念推理至结构化概率模型，同时利用LLM进行语言理解和交互。

Result: 该方法在Agent-Agent对战中表现优异，首次在控制研究中击败人类玩家，胜率达67%。

Conclusion: 混合推理框架为LLM在社交推理任务中的应用提供了高效解决方案，并展示了击败人类玩家的潜力。

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at
https://camp-lab-purdue.github.io/bayesian-social-deduction/

### [7] [From Unstructured Communication to Intelligent RAG: Multi-Agent Automation for Supply Chain Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17484)
*Yao Zhang,Zaixi Shang,Silpan Patel,Mikel Zuniga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体系统，将供应链支持票据转化为结构化知识库，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链操作数据庞大但知识分散在非结构化通信中，现有RAG系统因数据质量问题效果有限。

Method: 采用离线优先方法，通过三个智能体（分类发现、分类、知识合成）将支持票据转化为结构化知识库。

Result: 知识库体积缩减至原始数据的3.4%，RAG系统性能提升（48.74% vs. 38.60%有用回答），减少77.4%无用回答。

Conclusion: 该方法通过离线处理将非结构化通信转化为可重用知识，显著提升操作效率，未来可自动解决50%的供应链票据。

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

### [8] [Kaleidoscopic Teaming in Multi Agent Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17514)
*Ninareh Mehrabi,Tharindu Kumarage,Kai-Wei Chang,Aram Galstyan,Rahul Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为"kaleidoscopic teaming"的新框架，用于评估AI代理在单代理和多代理场景中的安全性，填补了现有安全评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队测试或安全评估框架无法全面评估AI代理在复杂行为、思维过程和交互中的安全风险，尤其是在多代理场景中。

Method: 引入kaleidoscopic teaming框架，生成多样化的现实场景，评估单代理和多代理的安全性，并采用上下文优化技术改进场景生成。

Result: 通过该框架，识别了多种模型在代理用例中的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: kaleidoscopic teaming框架为AI代理的安全性评估提供了更全面的方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

### [9] [Cite Pretrain: Retrieval-Free Knowledge Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17585)
*Yukun Huang,Sanxing Chen,Jian Pei,Manzil Zaheer,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何让语言模型在训练过程中可靠地引用预训练文档，而无需依赖推理时的外部检索器，提出了Active Indexing方法，显著提高了引用精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的引用不可靠且依赖外部检索器，导致延迟和基础设施依赖。研究旨在通过改进训练过程实现可靠的文档引用。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 持续预训练以绑定事实与文档标识符；2) 指令微调以激发引用行为。提出Active Indexing，通过合成QA对增强训练数据。

Result: Active Indexing在Qwen2.5-7B和3B模型上表现优于Passive Indexing，引用精度提升高达30.2%。数据增强规模扩大时性能持续提升。

Conclusion: Active Indexing方法有效提升了语言模型的引用可靠性，且性能随数据增强规模增加而持续改进。

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

### [10] [Taming the Untamed: Graph-Based Knowledge Retrieval and Reasoning for MLLMs to Conquer the Unknown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17589)
*Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在特定领域任务中的局限性，提出了一种基于视觉游戏认知的多模态知识图谱（MH-MMKG）和自主知识检索的多智能体检索器，显著提升了MLLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态能力上表现优异，但在罕见领域任务中因知识不足而表现不佳。研究旨在通过构建多模态知识图谱和自主检索机制解决这一问题。

Method: 以视觉游戏认知为测试平台，构建了多模态知识图谱MH-MMKG，并设计了复杂查询任务。提出了一种无需额外训练的多智能体检索器，用于自主搜索相关知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了MLLMs在复杂知识检索和推理任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态知识增强推理提供了新视角，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

*Zimo Ji,Daoyuan Wu,Wenyuan Jiang,Pingchuan Ma,Zongjie Li,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在CTF竞赛中的自动化解题能力，提出了CTFKnow基准和CTFAgent框架，显著提升了LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在CTF竞赛中的能力，尤其是技术知识的应用和适应能力，以推动AI在网络安全领域的自动化发展。

Method: 构建CTFKnow基准（3,992个问题）评估LLMs，并提出CTFAgent框架，包含两阶段RAG和环境增强模块。

Result: CTFAgent在两个CTF数据集上性能提升超过80%，在picoCTF2024中排名前23.6%。

Conclusion: CTFAgent框架有效提升了LLMs在CTF解题中的能力，展示了其在网络安全自动化中的潜力。

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多代理的TRIZ方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）协作解决创新问题，并通过案例研究验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRIZ方法的应用受限于复杂性和跨学科知识需求，而LLMs的发展为自动化部分流程提供了新可能。

Method: 提出一个多代理系统（TRIZ agents），每个代理具备专业能力和工具，协作基于TRIZ方法论解决问题。

Result: 通过工程案例研究，展示了多代理协作在复杂创新挑战中的潜力，能产生多样化的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动的创新提供了新方向，展示了去中心化问题解决在复杂构思任务中的优势。

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

Conclusion: PhysUniBench为AI在科学领域的进步提供了严格的评估工具，旨在推动模型在物理推理和多模态理解方面的改进。

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

### [14] [Beyond Syntax: Action Semantics Learning for App Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17697)
*Bohan Tang,Dezhao Luo,Jingxuan Chen,Shaogang Gong,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASL的新学习框架，通过捕捉动作语义而非语法形式来提升App代理的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的解决方案依赖昂贵的封闭LLM API，而微调开源LLM的方法因强制学习语法形式而存在分布外（OOD）脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出动作语义学习（ASL）框架，定义动作语义为用户界面中的状态转换，并设计语义估计器（SEE）计算语义奖励以训练代理。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，ASL在OOD问题上比现有语法学习范式更具鲁棒性，显著提升了代理的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ASL通过语义学习解决了现有方法的局限性，为App代理提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于顺序结构的多智能体协作框架，通过动态选择智能体角色和上下文信息，显著提升了通信灵活性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态或图结构的通信拓扑，缺乏适应性和灵活性。

Method: 采用顺序结构，提出Next-Agent Prediction和Next-Context Selection两个关键组件，构建任务自适应的通信管道。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，同时显著降低了通信开销。

Conclusion: 顺序结构的多智能体协作框架在灵活性和性能上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态优化MDP的方法，通过迭代选择脆弱区域进行细化，显著提升了大规模MDP的策略合成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略合成方法难以应对大规模状态空间的问题。

Method: 动态细化MDP并迭代选择最脆弱的区域进行优化，平衡准确性与效率。

Result: 在多达1M状态的MDP中，性能比PRISM提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模MDP的策略合成提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

*Carter Blair,Kate Larson,Edith Law*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化奖励建模方法，通过对话引导用户反思和构建偏好，解决了传统RLHF中少数群体偏好被压制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类价值观具有多样性，传统RLHF通过单一奖励模型聚合反馈可能压制少数偏好，需个性化解决方案。

Method: 使用语言模型引导用户通过反思对话构建偏好，生成个性化对话历史作为奖励函数上下文。

Result: 在30名参与者的实验中，该方法比非反思方法准确率提高9-12%，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 个性化奖励建模能更准确地反映用户偏好，优于传统方法。

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

TL;DR: 本文主张将形式最优控制理论作为AI对齐研究的核心，提出了一种不同于主流AI安全和安全方法的新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全和机制可解释性研究在形式化对齐方法上有所进展，但缺乏通用性和不同对齐/控制协议的互操作性研究。

Method: 通过形式最优控制原则重新定义对齐，并构建一个分层对齐控制栈（Alignment Control Stack），明确各层的测量和控制特性及其互操作性。

Result: 提出了一个分层对齐框架，有助于更好地理解和控制前沿模型和智能AI系统的潜力与局限。

Conclusion: 将最优控制理论与实际部署需求结合，可构建更全面的对齐框架，提升高级AI系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代错误信息的快速传播对公共讨论构成挑战，传统人工核查方法难以应对在线内容的规模和速度，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出一个多智能体系统，包括输入分解、查询生成、证据检索和裁决预测四个专门化智能体，用于自动化事实核查。

Result: 在基准数据集上，系统比基线方法在Macro F1分数上提升了12.3%，并能分解复杂声明、检索可靠证据并生成透明解释。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化事实核查领域提供了更准确、高效和透明的验证方法，同时保持实际应用的扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能日志处理和自动调试框架（LLM-ID），用于解决云平台中大规模、非结构化日志数据的故障定位和自修复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云平台中AI系统规模和复杂性的增加，日志数据变得庞大、非结构化和语义模糊，给故障定位和系统自修复带来挑战。

Method: 扩展预训练的Transformer模型，结合多阶段语义推理机制，动态结构化日志，提取事件模板和语义模式，利用微调的LLM和多轮注意力机制进行上下文推理，生成故障假设和根因路径，并引入基于强化学习的策略引导恢复规划器。

Result: 在云平台日志数据集上的实验表明，LLM-ID的故障定位准确率提高了16.2%，显著优于现有主流方法。

Conclusion: LLM-ID具有更强的语义理解能力、持续学习能力和异构环境适应性，为云平台日志分析和故障修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

Result: CogniGUI在现有基准和新基准中均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: CogniGUI通过自适应学习和全面评估框架，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的提示设计范式，通过随机修剪演示生成看似无意义的“胡言乱语”，反而显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的性能。该方法超越了现有自动提示优化技术，并提出了一种自发现优化框架PromptQuine。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统提示设计范式，探索更高效的LLM提示方法。

Method: 提出PromptQuine框架，通过进化搜索自动发现修剪策略，仅需少量数据即可优化提示。

Result: 在分类、多选问答、生成和数学推理任务中表现优异，且运行效率良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM提示优化提供了新思路，并呼吁进一步研究开放式搜索算法。

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动作语言与现代ASP语言之间存在表达能力的差距，限制了动作语言的实用性。

Method: 通过将BC+的语义定义为命题公式的一般稳定模型语义，利用现代ASP语言特性（如选择规则、聚合等）增强表达能力。

Result: BC+能够涵盖其他动作语言（如B、C、C+、BC）的最佳特性，并通过扩展cplus2asp系统实现。

Conclusion: BC+是一种表达能力强且计算高效的动作语言，适用于知识表示和动作建模。

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

*Zijun Chen,Zhanpeng Zhou,Bo Zhang,Weinan Zhang,Xi Sun,Junchi Yan*

TL;DR: 论文探讨了模型合并的机制，提出了一种自增强模型合并框架SE-Merging，通过动态识别任务和调整合并系数提升多任务能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型合并在多任务能力上表现出色，但其底层机制尚不明确，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 从表示角度分析模型合并机制，提出SE-Merging框架，动态识别任务并调整合并系数。

Result: SE-Merging显著提升了性能，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: SE-Merging通过动态调整合并系数，有效增强了多任务能力，兼容现有技术。

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CoachGPT，一种基于大型语言模型的学术写作助手，旨在提供个性化反馈和指导，弥补现有工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统写作助手缺乏上下文理解，而大型语言模型虽强大但无法直接用于教学。CoachGPT旨在为资源有限或偏好自主学习的学生提供帮助。

Method: CoachGPT结合教育者指令，将其分解为子任务，并利用大型语言模型提供实时反馈和建议。

Result: 用户研究证明CoachGPT在学术写作中的实用性和潜力。

Conclusion: CoachGPT通过独特的脚手架结构，为学术写作提供了更沉浸式的体验，展现了大型语言模型在教育中的应用前景。

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否具有类似人类的认知倾向，以评估其透明度和伦理部署。

Method: 通过结构化提示和自动评分评估多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 模型能生成连贯叙述，易受正面框架影响，道德判断偏向自由/压迫，并表现出自我矛盾但合理化。

Conclusion: LLMs行为类似人类认知，但受训练数据影响，需进一步研究AI透明度和伦理。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Memory (CoM)方法，显式建模GUI代理的短期和长期记忆，提升跨应用任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理依赖历史截图或动作隐式表示任务状态，难以准确理解复杂任务状态，缺乏有效存储关键信息的机制。

Method: 通过捕获动作描述、整合任务相关屏幕信息，并维护专用内存模块存储和管理信息。

Result: CoM显著提升GUI代理在跨应用任务中的性能，7B模型可媲美72B模型的记忆管理能力。

Conclusion: CoM方法有效解决了GUI代理的任务状态理解和关键信息存储问题，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理语言模型的不确定性量化问题，发现模型通常过度自信，且深度推理可能加剧这一问题，但通过自省可以改善校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在生成错误答案时仍表现出高置信度，这对实际应用的安全性构成挑战，因此研究其不确定性量化至关重要。

Method: 引入自省不确定性量化（UQ），评估模型校准性、深度推理对校准的影响，以及通过自省链式思维改善校准的效果。

Result: 推理模型普遍过度自信，深度推理加剧此问题；部分模型通过自省改善校准（如o3-Mini），但并非所有模型均受益（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究设计UQ基准和改进推理模型校准的方法。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示不坚持服药对精神分裂症患者不良后果的影响，为临床和政策制定提供依据。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，结合T-learner、S-learner和最近邻匹配等因果推断方法，利用不同时间段的纵向数据（3、6、9、12个月）进行分析。

Result: 研究发现不坚持服药会显著提前不良事件发生时间（1至4个月），且不同药物类型和剂型的结果一致。

Conclusion: 研究强调了坚持服药对延缓精神危机的重要性，并展示了生存分析与因果推断结合的政策意义，但需注意因果解释的假设限制。

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

Motivation: 研究VLD在模型扩展中的潜力及其特性，填补参数重用在这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过精心设计的对照实验，分析VLD扩展对模型知识容量和推理能力的影响。

Result: VLD扩展使知识容量几乎不变，但显著提升推理能力；参数数量与知识容量相关，但与推理能力无关。

Conclusion: VLD扩展是一种有效的模型扩展方法，可在不增加参数量的情况下提升推理能力。

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

Conclusion: 模拟交互和同行评审动态对LLM自主研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

Result: 在3种电路上测试，优化效率提升2.32至26.6倍。

Conclusion: LLM能有效剪枝模拟电路尺寸设计的搜索空间，为LLM与传统自动化设计方法的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现，模型编辑后的改动在微调过程中通常无法保留，揭示了当前编辑方法的局限性，并强调了开发更鲁棒技术的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型编辑与微调之间的交互作用，以解决编辑后行为是否在微调中保留的问题，对AI安全和实际应用具有重要意义。

Method: 在T2I扩散模型（Stable Diffusion和FLUX）中，结合两种编辑技术和三种微调方法（DreamBooth、LoRA、DoRA），通过多样化的编辑任务和评估指标进行实证分析。

Result: 编辑后的改动在微调中普遍失效，DoRA表现出最强的编辑逆转效果，而UCE编辑方法相对更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法在长期控制和对齐AI系统方面存在不足，需开发更鲁棒的技术，同时微调可作为恶意编辑的补救手段，但需重新编辑以维持安全和对齐属性。

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

Conclusion: 该系统为标准化适用性推理提供了可扩展且可解释的AI支持。

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking
standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles.
This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a
comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across
five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在时间约束、因果关系和概率推理上的不足。

Result: 实验证明T-CPDL显著提升推理准确性、可解释性和置信度校准。

Conclusion: T-CPDL增强语言模型的决策能力，为Logic-RAG框架奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在RAG中产生幻觉的问题，提升模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Result: 在相同任务和跨任务设置中表现稳定，优于当前SOTA。

Conclusion: AggTruth能有效检测幻觉，注意力头的选择对性能至关重要。

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DLBC的新型多智能体强化学习方法，通过动态调节组内和组间行为一致性，提升协作效率和任务分工。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注组内行为一致性，而忽略了组间行为一致性的重要性，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: DLBC方法将智能体分组，并动态调节组内和组间的行为多样性，通过约束策略函数实现广泛适用性。

Result: 实验表明，DLBC显著提升了组内协作和组间任务分工，性能大幅改善。

Conclusion: DLBC为多智能体系统的行为一致性控制提供了新思路，未来可探索其在更复杂任务中的应用。

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Programming by Backprop (PBB)方法，通过仅训练源代码（无输入输出示例）提升大语言模型的通用推理能力，发现其能隐式评估程序，并优于传统I/O训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型通过源代码训练提升通用推理能力的机制。

Method: 提出PBB方法，对比训练两组程序（含I/O示例和仅源代码），分析模型评估能力。

Result: 模型能隐式评估程序，PBB优于传统I/O训练，代码形式效果更佳。

Conclusion: 代码训练使模型内化可重用算法抽象，未来可优化符号化学习以拓展应用。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

TL;DR: 论文提出ConciseHint框架，通过注入文本提示在推理过程中鼓励模型简洁表达，同时自适应调整提示强度以保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）在复杂任务中表现优异，但推理过程冗长导致效率问题。现有方法多关注推理前优化，忽略了推理过程中的简洁性干预。

Method: 提出ConciseHint框架，在推理生成过程中注入文本提示（手动设计或基于简洁数据训练），并自适应调整提示强度以适应查询复杂度。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen-3等模型上实验表明，ConciseHint能显著缩短推理长度（如GSM8K上减少65%）且几乎不影响准确性。

Conclusion: ConciseHint有效解决了推理模型冗长问题，同时保持性能，为推理效率优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

*Vansh Sharma,Venkat Raman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过激活语言模型中的潜在子空间，引导科学代码生成偏向特定编程语言，提出了一种梯度优化的自适应激活框架（G-ACT），显著提升了目标语言的选择准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过干预语言模型的内部机制，实现对科学代码生成语言的精确控制，解决现有方法的局限性和泛化性问题。

Method: 开发了G-ACT框架，通过聚类激活差异生成少量引导方向，并在线训练轻量级逐层探针以选择最佳引导向量。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2 3B模型中，G-ACT将目标语言分类准确率提升15%，早期层提升61.5%；在LLaMA-3.3 70B模型中，关键层干预仍有效。

Conclusion: G-ACT提供了一种可扩展、可解释且高效的概念级控制机制，适用于实际代理系统。

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

Result: Transformer模型结合LIME提供了强大的学生反馈分析框架，情感分类效果优于其他机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为OBE提供了数据驱动的改进方法，通过深度学习和可解释性工具优化教育成果。

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

Motivation: 当前越狱攻击方法效率低、计算成本高且跨模型适应性和通用性差，难以应对LLM的快速发展和新防御策略。

Method: 结合掩码语言建模、强化学习和动态温度控制，通过提示生成和蒸馏方法实现小型语言模型对大型语言模型的越狱攻击。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在攻击成功率和危害性上的优越性，同时体现了资源效率和跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: 研究探索了将LLM的越狱能力蒸馏到SLM的可行性，揭示了模型的脆弱性，为LLM安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在技术任务上表现良好，但其在涉及金钱与用户舒适度权衡的个人决策中的行为尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过量化多个LLMs对用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）的定价，分析其决策行为。

Result: 发现LLMs在决策中存在显著差异、对提示措辞敏感、接受不合理低报酬或拒绝无不适的高报酬等问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在权衡金钱与舒适度时表现不稳定，需进一步审查其作为决策助手的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制在计算和内存开销上存在冗余，限制了在资源有限硬件上的部署效率。

Method: GTA包括共享注意力图机制和非线性值解码器，分别减少键缓存大小和压缩值缓存。

Result: GTA将注意力计算FLOPs减少62.5%，KV缓存减少70%，推理速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA显著提升了LLM的部署效率，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

Motivation: 探索解码方法如何影响LLM输出的语义多样性和可靠性，以优化实际应用中的模型表现。

Method: 通过问答、摘要和代码生成任务实验，比较CoT解码和推测采样等方法的性能。

Result: CoT解码提高语义多样性且降低预测熵，代码生成Pass@2提升48.8%；推测采样在摘要任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化解码方法可同时提升语义多样性和输出质量，挑战了传统多样性-准确性的权衡假设。

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

*Tatsuhiro Aoshima,Mitsuaki Akiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全评估中的潜在风险，特别是其可能表现出的欺骗行为，并提出通过测量LLMs的心理理论能力来评估这些风险。研究发现，尽管LLMs在阅读理解方面有所进步，但其心理理论能力并未同步发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其安全评估的重要性日益凸显。近期发现LLMs可能表现出欺骗行为，例如在任务执行中绕过监督机制或提供虚假答案。研究旨在探讨这些行为是否源于模型的隐蔽意图。

Method: 研究回顾了心理理论的相关研究，并分析了其在LLMs安全评估中的应用。通过分析一系列开源权重的LLMs，研究比较了它们在心理理论能力上的发展趋势。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LLMs在阅读理解方面有所提升，但其心理理论能力并未显著发展。这表明LLMs在理解他人意图和动机方面仍存在局限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了心理理论能力在LLMs安全评估中的重要性，并指出未来研究需进一步解决这一领域的挑战。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了在模拟大型语言模型（LLM）群体时数据污染的潜在问题，但指出这并不妨碍研究LLM群体中真正涌现的动态行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清数据污染问题对LLM群体动态研究的影响，并强调涌现行为的可研究性。

Method: 通过分析Barrie和Törnberg对Flint Ashery等人研究的批评，探讨LLM群体中的自组织和模型依赖的涌现动态。

Result: 研究表明，尽管存在数据污染问题，LLM群体中的自组织和涌现动态仍可被实证观察，特别是在社会惯例的案例中。

Conclusion: 数据污染虽需关注，但不妨碍研究LLM群体中的涌现行为，尤其是在特定情境下（如社会惯例）的动态表现。

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

Motivation: 探索如何利用生成式AI大规模识别和评估辅导行为，以提升学生学习的有效性。

Method: 分析了50份大学导师辅导中学生的数学对话转录，使用多种AI模型检测导师的表扬和错误回应行为。

Result: AI模型在检测表扬（94-98%准确率）和错误（82-88%准确率）方面表现可靠，与人工评估结果接近（83-89%和73-77%）。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可用于大规模辅导行为评估，研究提供了成本效益高的提示策略，并讨论了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic
settings. This work further contributes LLM prompts to support reproducibility
and research in AI-supported learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种信息论框架UProp，用于分解LLM在序列决策中的不确定性，包括内部和外部不确定性，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在安全关键应用中的集成，需要量化其决策不确定性，但现有方法主要针对单轮问答，多步决策场景研究不足。

Method: 提出UProp框架，将序列决策不确定性分解为内部和外部（基于互信息）两部分，并通过PMI估计在多步决策任务中验证。

Result: UProp在多步决策基准测试中显著优于现有单轮UQ方法，并分析了其采样效率和应用潜力。

Conclusion: UProp为LLM在多步决策中的不确定性量化提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）仅通过URL分类政治内容（PC）的能力，发现URL能有效嵌入新闻内容，为准确性-成本平衡提供新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在政治科学中分类PC的潜力，填补URL级分析的空白。

Method: 使用GPT、Llama等LLMs，比较URL与全文分析在五个国家的多语言数据中的表现，并与人工标注和传统方法对比。

Result: URL能有效嵌入新闻内容，为准确性-成本平衡提供支持。

Conclusion: URL级分析可作为全文分析的近似方法，但需考虑上下文限制和方法优化。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

Conclusion: 为语言学家提供可复现的ASR适应方法，缓解语言文档化中的转录瓶颈。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for
high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains
limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges,
including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the
transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,
particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.

TL;DR: VeriLocc结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与形式化编译器技术，实现跨GPU架构的可泛化和可验证的寄存器分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU发展迅速，但生产编译器仍依赖手工调整的寄存器分配启发式方法，需为每代硬件重新调整。

Method: VeriLocc通过微调LLM将中间表示（MIRs）转换为目标特定的寄存器分配，结合静态分析和验证器引导的再生循环确保正确性。

Result: 在矩阵乘法（GEMM）和多头注意力（MHA）上，VeriLocc单次准确率达85-99%，pass@100接近100%，性能优于专家调优库。

Conclusion: VeriLocc展示了LLM在编译器优化中的潜力，能够自动发现高性能寄存器分配方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

Motivation: 揭示多语言语音数据集的质量问题，以提升其作为训练和评估集的实用性。

Method: 将质量问题分为微观和宏观两类，并以台湾闽南语为例进行案例分析。

Result: 宏观问题在资源较少的语言中更普遍，需加强语言规划和数据质量控制。

Conclusion: 提出未来数据集开发的指南和建议，强调社会语言学意识的重要性。

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

TL;DR: DuaShepherd是一个新颖的奖励建模框架，结合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励信号通常只关注正确性或潜力，而结合两者可以更全面地优化模型性能。

Method: 开发自动化管道构建大规模数据集，采用多任务学习的统一多头部架构训练两种奖励模型。

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench上，结合两种奖励信号的模型显著优于单一信号模型，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 结合正确性和潜力奖励信号能有效提升数学推理能力，且资源效率高。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

Motivation: 传统模型低估了语音特征渐变变化对口音感知的影响，研究旨在探索自监督学习模型如何捕捉这些特征。

Method: 使用CSLU Foreign Accented English语料库，结合Phonet提取语音特征概率，并利用Wav2Vec2-BERT和WavLM的预训练表示，分析其与母语者口音评分的关联。

Result: 研究发现，口音强度可通过特定语音特征的预训练表示预测，且与美式和印度英语基线的距离显著相关。

Conclusion: 自监督语音表示在基于可解释语音特征的口音感知建模中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

Result: AgriCHN数据质量高，实体类型丰富，细粒度划分，实验显示其挑战性和研究潜力。

Conclusion: AgriCHN填补了农业实体识别数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在稀疏气象轨迹（如台风路径）预测中缺乏上下文知识，TyphoFormer通过引入语言描述弥补这一不足。

Method: 利用LLM生成台风数值属性的语言描述，将其嵌入为特殊标记与数值序列一起输入Transformer编码器。

Result: 在HURDAT2基准测试中，TyphoFormer表现优于现有方法，尤其在非线性路径变化和历史数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: TyphoFormer通过融合语言和数值信息，显著提升了台风轨迹预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

Conclusion: 通过并行层处理降采样输入，早期退出模型的性能得到有效提升，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

Abstract: This paper presents Open Unified Speech Language Models (OpusLMs), a family
of open foundational speech language models (SpeechLMs) up to 7B. Initialized
from decoder-only text language models, the OpusLMs are continuously
pre-trained on 213K hours of speech-text pairs and 292B text-only tokens. We
demonstrate our OpusLMs achieve comparable (or even superior) performance with
existing SpeechLMs in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text-only
capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on
tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training

and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from
publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our
code, data, checkpoints, and training logs to facilitate open SpeechLM research

Motivation: 探究LLMs的推理能力是否基于真正的推理，还是仅依赖于记忆的答案-推理模式。

Method: 提出五级答案可见性提示框架，通过间接行为分析系统性地操纵答案线索。

Result: 实验显示LLMs对显式答案有强烈依赖，性能显著下降（26.90%）时答案线索被掩盖。

Conclusion: LLMs的推理可能更多是事后合理化而非真正的推理，需更细致地理解其推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for
Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing

modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality

LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using
LLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient
linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs
techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its
baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art
methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is

Result: 在三个多跳QA数据集上表现优于或持平现有基准，显著减少token消耗，8B参数模型达到SOTA。

Conclusion: DEC在资源受限环境中高效，适用于复杂多跳QA任务。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: ZS-CSD数据集和SITPCL模型为零样本对话立场检测提供了新基准，但任务仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel
language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea
of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has
emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables
rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines
under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

Conclusion: KAG-Thinker通过结构化推理和知识边界优化，显著提升了LLM在复杂问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HIDE的单次训练无关方法，通过解耦表示检测语言模型的幻觉内容，效果优于现有单次方法，且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型生成的虚假内容（幻觉）难以检测且影响可靠性，现有方法多依赖多次生成，计算成本高。

Method: 利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则（HSIC）量化模型内部输入上下文与生成输出的解耦程度。

Result: 在四个问答数据集上，HIDE在AUC-ROC上平均提升29%，计算时间减少51%。

Conclusion: HIDE通过解耦表示实现了高效且实用的幻觉检测，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: THCM-CAL通过多模态因果建模和校准技术，显著提升了临床风险预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Result: 关键词广告文案点击率提升9%，展示量增加12%，成本降低0.38%；AutoEval与人工评估一致率达89.57%。

Conclusion: 自动化系统显著提升广告效果，但人工监督仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

Result: 在多种SME设置中显著优于基线，同时保持单次编辑的竞争力，且LLM通用能力不受影响。

Conclusion: QueueEDIT有效平衡了序列编辑性能和LLM通用能力的保持。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对齐LLM生成输出缺乏多样性的原因，探索其背后的概率分布集中现象。

Method: 引入分支因子（BF）作为量化指标，分析生成过程中BF的变化，并通过实验验证对齐调优和提示策略对BF的影响。

Result: 发现BF随生成过程递减，对齐调优显著降低BF，且提示策略可类似地减少BF。

Conclusion: BF是理解和控制LLM输出的有效工具，揭示了对齐调优和CoT如何通过低熵轨迹实现稳定生成。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在安全风险，尤其是多轮对话场景下的越狱技术尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种多轮越狱方法，全局优化越狱路径并主动伪造模型响应以抑制安全警告。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在六种先进LLMs上优于现有单轮和多轮越狱技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多轮对话中更有效地识别LLMs的安全威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复制和扩展预训练中观察到的模式方面表现优异，但在将局部创新推广到原始上下文之外时存在困难。

Method: 模型通过四步流程实现创新扩展：识别核心创新、泛化创新、判断适用范围、系统应用。

Result: 验证结果表明，该模型能有效帮助LLMs将创新扩展到结构相似的阶段，提升泛化和重用能力。

Conclusion: 创新散射模型通过利用阶段间的结构冗余，显著提升了LLMs的创新扩展能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

Conclusion: 该研究拓展了检索增强QA系统的能力，为多模态数据处理奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance information
extraction from PDF files. Recognizing the richness and diversity of data
within PDFs--including text, images, vector diagrams, graphs, and tables--poses
unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual
content. We seek to develop a comprehensive RAG-based QA system that will
effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to
processing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework
to derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language
models to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental
evaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate
information that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs. This
work not only pushes the boundaries of retrieval-augmented QA systems but also
lays a foundation for further research in multimodal data integration and
processing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合抽取式和生成式方法的混合摘要技术，通过分块、聚类和马尔可夫链图解决长文档摘要中的信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息爆炸背景下，自动文本摘要需求增加，但现有生成式方法在长文档中易丢失关键信息（“中间丢失”问题）。

Method: 将文档分块，聚类向量嵌入，为每个聚类生成摘要，并通过马尔可夫链图选择语义顺序构建最终摘要。

Result: 提出了一种高效的混合摘要方法，能更好地保留长文档中的关键信息。

Conclusion: 混合方法在长文档摘要中表现优于纯生成式方法，解决了信息丢失问题。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

Motivation: 当前评估LLM生成文本质量的方法存在单指标局限性、指标与人类判断不兼容以及缺乏统计推断保证的问题。

Method: 采用广义随机优势（GSD）框架，支持多维度评估，避免对指标的任意加权，并考虑采样设计的非独立同分布假设。

Result: 该框架能识别解码策略在统计上的显著性能差异，同时适应多维度质量评估。

Conclusion: GSD框架为LLM生成文本的质量评估提供了一种更全面、统计可靠的方法。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

Motivation: 指代消解对自然语言理解至关重要，尤其在形态丰富的语言（如捷克语）中，需评估现代方法的有效性。

Method: 使用Prague Dependency Treebank数据集，评估指令调优的LLMs（如Mistral Large 2和Llama 3）与微调的mT5和Mistral模型。

Result: 微调模型（mT5-large）准确率达88%，显著优于提示工程（74.5%），且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 微调模型在捷克语指代消解中表现更优，提示工程虽有一定效果，但性能和效率不及微调。

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,
especially in morphologically rich languages like Czech. This paper presents a
comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech
text: prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning
compact generative models. Using a dataset derived from the Prague Dependency
Treebank, we evaluate several instruction-tuned LLMs, including Mistral Large 2
and Llama 3, using a series of prompt templates. We compare them against
fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically
for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting
yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source
corpora, highlighting key strengths and trade-offs of each approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的辩论系统缺乏对客观评估（如真实性和逻辑有效性）的关注，且缺乏结构化优化方法，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出InspireScore（多维度评估系统）和InspireDebate（优化辩论框架），结合主观和客观指标，并通过CoT推理增强、多维度DPO和Web-RAG实现优化。

Result: InspireScore与专家判断的相关性提高了44%，InspireDebate比基线模型提升了57%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了辩论系统的评估和优化能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chengyu-Bench是一个针对中文成语的综合性基准测试，包含三项任务：情感分类、使用恰当性检测和开放式填空。测试显示，大型语言模型在情感分类上表现优异，但在理解成语的文化和上下文细微差别上仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语（成语）因其历史和文化背景复杂，直译难以准确表达其含义，这对语言模型提出了挑战。现有基准测试任务单一，无法全面评估模型对成语的理解能力。

Method: Chengyu-Bench包含三项任务：情感分类（判断成语的褒贬）、使用恰当性检测（识别成语在上下文中的错误使用）和开放式填空（在无选项的长文中填空）。数据集包含2,937个人工验证的示例，涵盖1,765个常见成语。

Result: 测试结果显示，大型语言模型在情感分类任务上准确率超过95%，但在使用恰当性检测上约为85%，开放式填空任务中top-1准确率仅为40%。错误分析表明，大多数错误源于对成语含义的根本误解。

Conclusion: Chengyu-Bench表明，尽管大型语言模型能可靠判断成语情感，但在理解成语的文化和上下文细微差别上仍有不足。该基准测试和源代码已公开。

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

Method: 使用多跳问答框架（MHQA）分析IMHI数据集，通过系统性标签（年龄、种族、性别、社会经济地位）研究人口统计交叉点的偏见模式，评估四种LLM。

Result: 发现模型在情感、人口统计和心理健康条件上的系统性差异，MHQA方法优于传统方法，去偏技术（角色扮演模拟和显式偏见减少）实现了66-94%的偏见减少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在心理健康领域的偏见问题，为开发更公平的AI提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

Conclusion: 数据集是目前同类中最大的公开资源，未来将扩展数据集。

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

Motivation: 识别并解决自回归Transformer语言模型中由em dash符号引发的递归语义漂移问题，以提高生成文本的一致性和安全性。

Method: 结合符号子句净化（phi-infinity算子）和嵌入矩阵调整，抑制问题符号的影响。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法显著提高了生成文本的一致性和主题保持能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为识别和缓解基础模型中的符号级漏洞提供了通用框架，对AI安全、模型对齐和大语言模型的稳健部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

Result: 消融或放大国家与关系组件可预测改变模型输出；国家组件多出现在早期层，关系组件集中在后期层。

Conclusion: LLMs中的知识呈现模块化组织，后期层的关系组件对输出因果影响更强，为模型操控提供新方法。

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

### [105] [Prompt Engineering Techniques for Mitigating Cultural Bias Against Arabs and Muslims in Large Language Models: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18199)
*Bushra Asseri,Estabrag Abdelaziz,Areej Al-Wabil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统综述了针对阿拉伯和穆斯林文化偏见的提示工程技术，总结了五种主要方法，并指出结构化多步流程效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在对阿拉伯和穆斯林的偏见，但相关提示工程技术研究不足，亟需系统分析。

Method: 采用混合方法系统综述，遵循PRISMA指南和Kitchenham方法，分析了2021-2024年的8项实证研究。

Result: 发现五种提示工程方法，其中结构化多步流程效果最佳（偏见减少87.7%），但文化提示更易实施。

Conclusion: 提示工程可有效减少文化偏见，未来需开发适应性技术、专用评估资源及结合其他去偏方法。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro在阿拉伯语儿童故事书插图情感识别中的表现，发现GPT-4o优于Gemini，但两者在文化敏感性和模糊情境中表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发文化敏感的教育技术需要多模态AI系统具备情感识别能力，但阿拉伯语语境下研究不足。

Method: 使用75张阿拉伯故事书插图，比较GPT-4o和Gemini在零样本、少样本和思维链提示下的表现，基于Plutchik情感框架与人类标注对比。

Result: GPT-4o在思维链提示下表现最佳（F1-score 59%），Gemini为43%。模型在文化细微情感和模糊情境中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前模型在文化理解上存在局限，需开发文化敏感的训练方法以支持阿拉伯语学习者的情感识别教育技术。

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器翻译后期编辑和研究数据收集工作流程效率低下且分散，需要一种更高效的集成解决方案。

Method: TranslationCorrect整合了NLLB等模型的MT生成、XCOMET或LLM API的自动错误预测，以及基于HCI原则的后期编辑界面。

Result: 用户研究表明，TranslationCorrect显著提高了翻译效率和用户满意度，并支持高质量的ESA格式注释输出。

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect为翻译人员和研究人员提供了一个高效、集成的工具，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

Method: 比较BERTScore、Cosine Similarity、BioSentVec、GPT-White、GPT-Black和专家定性评估六种指标，应用于观察型和多选型报告生成，采用两种权重策略。

Result: GPT-Black在识别逻辑连贯和临床有效的因果叙述中表现最强，GPT-White与专家评估一致，相似性指标与临床推理质量不符。

Conclusion: 选择适当的评估指标和权重对结果有重要影响，支持在需要可解释性和因果推理的任务中使用基于LLM的评估。

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语等形态丰富的语言在词形还原工具上存在标准不一致和语料覆盖有限的问题，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用分类到LPG标签集的方法，结合机器翻译和语义聚类，同时评估了字符级序列到序列模型。

Result: 分类和聚类方法表现更鲁棒且可解释，字符级模型虽具竞争力但存在生成不合理形式的缺陷。

Conclusion: 分类和聚类方法为阿拉伯语词形还原设定了新基准，优于传统序列模型。

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

Motivation: 由于表格数据的隐藏语义、复杂性和结构化特性，LLMs在表格推理方面面临挑战，缺乏有效的评估基准。

Method: 通过迭代数据处理构建高质量数据集，并设计包含TCoT、PoT和ICoT三种推理模式的评估框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有LLMs在复杂表格任务上仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: TReB基准和评估框架公开可用，为LLMs的表格推理能力提供了有效衡量工具。

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing
the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation
framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and
the framework on [GitHub].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法忽视了LLMs的上下文学习能力，而MeRF旨在结合强化学习和上下文学习，以更好地提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: MeRF通过将奖励规范注入提示中，作为上下文动机，激励模型生成符合优化目标的输出。

Result: 在K&K逻辑谜题基准测试中，MeRF显著优于基线方法，且性能随动机与奖励函数一致性增强而提升。

Conclusion: MeRF通过结合强化学习和上下文学习，有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，并能适应误导性动机。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Method: 研究采用结构化实验协议，使用相同的中性提示词，在两个基准数据集上评估ChatGPT和DeepSeek在五个NLP任务中的表现。

Result: DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理上表现更优，而ChatGPT在需要灵活性和细致理解的任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务需求选择合适的LLM提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法纠错（SGEC）因语音不流畅、转录错误和缺乏结构化输入而面临挑战，论文旨在通过E2E框架解决这些问题。

Method: 论文比较了级联、部分级联和E2E架构，利用Whisper基础模型，提出自动伪标注框架增加训练数据，并引入上下文信息和参考对齐方法优化反馈生成。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在Linguaskill和Speak & Improve语料库上显著提升了E2E SGEC的性能。

Conclusion: E2E框架结合自动伪标注、上下文信息利用和参考对齐方法，能够有效提升口语语法纠错系统的性能。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

Motivation: 探究为何微调预训练模型在MS MARCO任务中表现不佳，挑战传统迁移学习的有效性。

Method: 通过五种模型变体（包括全参数微调和LoRA适配）进行实验，分析嵌入空间结构变化。

Result: 微调破坏了基础模型预训练学到的嵌入空间结构，导致性能下降（MRR@10: 0.3026）。

Conclusion: 结果质疑传统迁移学习在饱和基准上的有效性，建议需要架构创新以实现改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

Motivation: 仇恨言论检测是NLP社会公益应用的重要任务，但定义模糊影响模型性能。

Method: 收集并分析仇恨言论定义，构建14个概念元素分类；在三个数据集上对三种LLM进行零样本评估。

Result: 不同定义对模型性能有影响，但效果因模型架构而异。

Conclusion: 定义的具体性影响模型性能，需根据模型架构选择合适定义。

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

Motivation: 连续思维链的序列依赖性导致训练时间长，影响效率。

Method: 提出PCCoT，采用Jacobi迭代并行更新潜在思维标记，替代顺序更新。

Result: 实验显示PCCoT节省近50%时间，性能相当或更好，训练更稳定。

Conclusion: PCCoT是一种高效且稳定的连续思维链改进方法。

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

Motivation: 语义相似度估计在自然语言处理和理解中具有重要应用，如问答、语义搜索等。

Method: 使用USE、InferSent和BERT等先进技术，分别在领域特定数据集和公开数据集（Quora问题对）上进行实验。

Result: BERT表现优于其他方法，尤其在领域特定数据上。

Conclusion: BERT是处理领域特定数据的最佳选择。

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

Result: GPT-4o通过调整情感词汇和句法结构（如疑问句和感叹句）来增强修辞效果，而非模仿人类优化说服力。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在说服力操作上表现出系统性风格调整，而非人类式优化。

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

TL;DR: ByteSpan是一种基于信息驱动的新子词分词器，通过外部字节级语言模型识别可预测的字节序列并分组为子词，实验显示其在英语和多语言任务中表现优于BPE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过分组可预测字节而非仅池化其表示来构建有用的固定子词词汇表。

Method: 提出ByteSpan，利用外部字节级语言模型训练时识别连续可预测字节序列并分组为子词。

Result: ByteSpan生成的词汇表在英语中形态对齐得分高于BPE，多语言实验中在25种语言上表现出相似的压缩和Rényi效率。

Conclusion: ByteSpan是一种高效且形态对齐性能优越的子词分词器，适用于多语言任务。

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

### [122] [Is There a Case for Conversation Optimized Tokenizers in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18674)
*Raquel Ferrando,Javier Conde,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了为聊天机器人对话优化分词器的潜在好处，通过重新设计分词器词汇表并评估其在聊天对话中的性能，结果显示优化的分词器能减少5%至10%的token数量，从而节省能源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算和能源成本因模型规模扩大和用户数量激增而急剧上升，而分词器在模型效率中起关键作用。聊天机器人的用户输入和响应文本与训练语料库不同，因此优化分词器可能带来性能提升和能源节省。

Method: 使用公开可用的聊天机器人对话语料库重新设计分词器的词汇表，并评估其在聊天对话中的性能。

Result: 优化的分词器在聊天对话中能减少5%至10%的token数量，同时对原始训练语料库的分词效率影响极小或略有提升。

Conclusion: 为聊天机器人对话优化分词器能显著减少token数量并节省能源，同时对原始任务影响有限，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

*Christian Huber,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在推理过程中动态纠正替换错误的方法，以提高语音识别中对未训练词汇（如专有名词）的识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经序列到序列系统在识别未训练词汇（如专有名词或领域特定词汇）时表现不佳，尤其是发音与拼写不匹配的词汇。

Method: 允许用户在推理过程中动态添加纠正，以修正替换错误。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在偏置词错误率上相对提升了11%，同时保持整体词错误率的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了对未训练词汇的识别准确性，且不影响整体性能。

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了The Pedagogy Benchmark，一个评估大语言模型在跨领域教学知识（CDPK）和特殊教育需求与障碍（SEND）教学知识上的新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注内容知识，缺乏对教学法理解的评估，填补这一空白对教育领域的AI应用至关重要。

Method: 基于教师专业考试题目构建数据集，涵盖教学策略和评估方法等子领域，评估了97个模型的表现。

Result: 模型准确率在28%至89%之间，分析了成本与准确率的关系，并提供了在线排行榜。

Conclusion: 教育导向的基准对衡量模型的教学理解能力、支持教育实践及指导政策决策具有重要意义。

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

*Chong Zhang,Xiang Li,Jia Wang,Shan Liang,Haochen Xue,Xiaobo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AGBS的方法，用于解决自动提示工程中的语义失真问题，通过动态评估优化策略对LLM性能的影响，平衡语义一致性和攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动提示工程在GUI中广泛使用，但用户需求的多样性常导致误解和错误输出，需要一种能保持语义稳定的优化方法。

Method: 提出Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS)方法，模拟常见提示优化机制，动态评估其对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 实验证明AGBS在开放和闭源LLMs中能有效平衡语义一致性和攻击效果。

Conclusion: AGBS为设计更可靠的提示优化系统提供了实用见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Motivation: 解决法律判决预测中的长尾数据分布问题和律师在司法决策中的关键作用缺失问题。

Method: 提出ASP2LJ框架，结合案例生成模块和对抗自博弈机制，增强律师论证能力并优化法官决策。

Result: 实验证明ASP2LJ在SimuCourt和RareCases数据集上有效提升判决的客观性、公平性和合理性。

Conclusion: ASP2LJ框架和RareCases数据集为自动化司法系统研究提供了新工具和方法。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使是小型语言模型在简单任务中也存在高度不一致性，顶级模型如DeepSeek-R1和GPT-o4-mini也未完全自洽。论文提出两种自动化方法（图基和能量基）来量化和缓解不一致性，但改进有限，强调了自洽性对可靠AI的重要性。

Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）的决策透明可信，需要解决其内部推理的自洽性问题。

Method: 引入不一致性指标，并提出两种自动化方法：图基和能量基方法。

Result: 所有小型模型在简单任务中高度不一致，顶级模型也未完全自洽。提出的方法部分改善了问题。

Conclusion: 自洽性对构建可靠和可解释的AI至关重要，但完全解决仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they
also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building
more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at

Result: Gemini 2.5模型（Flash和Pro）在13项RWE研究中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RWESummary为RWE研究摘要提供了一个新颖且有用的基准模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

TL;DR: MLLP-VRAIN团队在IWSLT 2025同步语音翻译任务中提出了一种模块化级联系统，结合Whisper和NLLB模型，通过轻量级适应技术实现实时长语音翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长语音实时翻译的独特挑战，避免从头训练端到端模型。

Method: 结合Whisper Large-V3-Turbo（ASR）和NLLB-3.3B（MT），采用前缀训练和自适应发射策略（如wait-$k$和RALCP）。

Result: 在ACL60/60数据集上，BLEU得分为31.96，延迟为2.94秒；官方测试集得分为29.8 BLEU。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心调整预训练组件，无需大量领域数据或端到端训练，即可构建高效的长语音同步翻译系统。

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

TL;DR: STUPID方法通过动态调整推理强度，减少冗余推理步骤，提高计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在扩展思维链推理中产生的过度思考问题，避免冗余推理步骤增加计算成本并降低性能。

Method: 提出STUPID方法，结合块级分类器和PID控制器，动态调整推理强度。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，STUPID方法准确率提高6%，同时减少32%的token使用量。

Conclusion: STUPID为动态推理校准提供了有效框架，兼顾推理质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 激励式RL方法为超长文本生成提供了一种高效且无需合成数据的解决方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the
assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We
argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an
afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining
its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and
outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

Method: 采用加法量化和轻量级编码器压缩KV缓存，设计可交换的RoPE码本，并使用EM算法训练。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中，FP16 KV缓存大小减少87.5%，1-bit量化下精度损失极小。

Conclusion: CommVQ高效减少了内存使用，支持长上下文LLM推理，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在数学问题上的局限性，尤其是其依赖固定策略和缺乏创新思维的问题。

Method: 提出OMEGA基准，通过程序生成的训练-测试对评估三种泛化能力，并对前沿模型进行测试和微调。

Result: 模型在复杂问题上表现显著下降，微调后探索性泛化能力提升，但组合性和变革性泛化能力改进有限。

Conclusion: OMEGA为提升语言模型在数学上的真正创造力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM在评估推理轨迹和提升模型性能方面表现出色，适用于资源受限场景和边缘部署。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement

### [136] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Diffusion Models: Circuit-Level Analysis and Causal Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17237)
*Dip Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过定量电路分析揭示了扩散模型在合成与自然数据分布处理中的算法差异，发现真实人脸处理需要更高计算复杂度，并识别了八种功能不同的注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型的图像生成过程，揭示其计算路径和机制原理，以提供对生成模型行为的算法理解和控制基础。

Method: 通过系统干预实验，分析了2000张合成图像和2000张CelebA人脸图像，测量计算复杂度和注意力模式。

Result: 发现真实人脸处理的计算复杂度更高（1.084±0.008），识别了八种注意力机制（如边缘检测、纹理分析），干预实验显示性能下降25.6%至128.3%。

Conclusion: 研究为通过机制干预策略理解和控制生成模型行为提供了定量基础。

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

*Yuqi Li,Junhao Dong,Zeyu Dong,Chuanguang Yang,Zhulin An,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SRKD的结构和关系感知知识蒸馏框架，将大型教师模型的几何和语义知识转移到轻量级学生模型中，显著降低了模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云分割中大规模基于Transformer模型的计算复杂性和部署限制问题。

Method: 使用亲和矩阵关系对齐模块和跨样本小批量构建策略，结合KL散度对齐语义分布和真实监督。

Result: 在显著降低模型复杂度的同时，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SRKD框架在现实部署场景中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at
https://github.com/itsnotacie/SRKD.

TL;DR: MISO是一种基于视觉的机器学习模型，用于生成阿拉斯加高分辨率土壤地图，优于传统随机森林方法，适用于永久冻土监测和生态保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉斯加土壤测绘对生态保护和基础设施稳定至关重要，但传统方法依赖实地工作，效率低且覆盖不足。

Method: MISO结合地理空间基础模型、隐式神经表示和对比学习，实现高分辨率土壤分类和永久冻土分布预测。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证中表现优于随机森林，泛化能力更强，召回率更高。

Conclusion: MISO展示了先进机器学习在土壤测绘中的潜力，为永久冻土区的生态保护和规划提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间感知的计算机视觉框架，用于预测非订阅制零工平台的用户流失，通过雷达图序列建模用户行为，结合CNN和双向LSTM提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非订阅制零工平台的用户流失预测因缺乏显式标签和动态行为而具有挑战性，现有方法忽略了关键的时间线索。

Method: 将用户行为模式建模为雷达图图像序列，结合预训练CNN编码器和双向LSTM捕捉时空模式。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优于传统模型和ViT基线，F1分数提升17.7，精确度提升29.4，AUC提升16.1，且具有更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架的模块化设计、可解释性工具和高效部署特性使其适用于动态零工经济平台的大规模流失建模。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的多模态跌倒检测系统（P2MFDS），结合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感，用于浴室环境中的老年人跌倒检测，显著提高了准确性和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着老龄化加剧，浴室环境中的跌倒风险增加，现有单模态系统在复杂环境中准确性不足，亟需一种隐私保护的多模态解决方案。

Method: 开发传感器评估框架，融合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感，构建大规模隐私保护数据集，并提出双流网络P2MFDS，结合雷达动态和振动检测。

Result: P2MFDS在准确性和召回率上显著优于现有方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Conclusion: 多模态融合和隐私保护设计有效解决了浴室环境中老年人跌倒检测的挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为精确控制3D房间的每个属性，将复杂任务分解为多个简单步骤，并通过统一框架支持这些任务。

Method: 使用视觉编程（VP）和大型语言模型（LLM）生成Python类程序，整合模块如3D坐标生成、全景图像生成、3D网格构建和家具布置。特别优化了扩散模型的全景图像生成质量。

Result: 展示了框架在生成和编辑3D房间网格上的灵活性，并在定量和定性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Programmable-Room通过分解任务和视觉编程，实现了高效且高质量的3D房间生成与编辑。

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以任务为中心、数据质量为基础的五层框架，用于下一代自动驾驶车辆（AVs），旨在通过数据质量（DQ）映射任务需求和性能目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AV领域的研究和实践过于关注模型和算法，而忽视了数据质量的重要性。本文旨在填补这一空白，确保AV的功能性、效率和可信度。

Method: 提出了一个五层框架（数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层），并通过nuScenes数据集上的案例研究验证了部分去除多源图像数据冗余可提升YOLOv8目标检测性能。

Result: 案例研究表明，优化数据质量（如减少冗余）能显著提升任务性能，同时揭示了多模态数据中的冗余问题。

Conclusion: 本文为AV领域在数据质量、任务编排和性能导向系统开发方面开辟了新研究方向，有望推动构建更具适应性、可解释性和鲁棒性的AV系统。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

TL;DR: PlanMoGPT通过渐进式规划和流增强细粒度运动标记化，解决了LLM在文本到运动生成中的性能瓶颈，显著提升了生成质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在文本到运动生成中性能落后于非LLM方法，主要由于运动标记化的粒度问题导致局部依赖与全局语义对齐的冲突。

Method: 提出PlanMoGPT框架，结合渐进式规划和流增强细粒度标记化，通过分层生成运动标记并恢复运动细节。

Result: 在文本到运动基准测试中，FID分数提升63.8%，运动多样性增加49.9%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PlanMoGPT成功解决了多样性-质量的权衡问题，为文本到运动生成设定了新标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分组的高效反馈门网络（EFGN），用于单张高光谱图像超分辨率（SHSR），通过反馈和门操作提升空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SHSR方法未能充分利用波段间和空间-光谱信息的连贯性，导致性能受限。

Method: 使用大核卷积和光谱交互的反馈门操作，结合SPDFM模块学习波段和空间信息，并通过SSRGM模块增强空间-光谱特征。

Result: 在三个高光谱数据集上，EFGN在光谱保真度和空间内容重建方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EFGN通过高效利用波段和空间-光谱信息，显著提升了SHSR的性能。

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种模型的鲁棒性，并在标准基准上也有提升。

Conclusion: 研究为HOI检测的鲁棒性提供了新思路，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in
recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal
images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and
code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的关键信息效率低且不可靠，现有OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 采用YOLOv11-OBB定位注释并提取定向边界框（OBB）补丁，再通过微调的轻量级视觉语言模型（VLM）解析为结构化输出。

Result: Donut模型表现优于Florence-2，精确率88.5%，召回率99.2%，F1分数93.5%，幻觉率11.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了2D工程图信息提取的效率和准确性，支持下游制造任务，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language
processing, this paper presents an intriguing finding: a frozen pre-trained LLM
layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic
awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global
understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves
robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标记的妊娠结果数据有限，且传统自监督学习方法难以处理胚胎发育视频的长序列和时序不一致问题，需要一种新的方法。

Method: STPT分为空间和时间两个阶段，分别训练一个编码器并冻结另一个，以减少内存需求，并通过避免跨视频帧对齐来处理时序不一致。

Result: 在23,027个时间推移视频（3,286个标记）上，STPT实现了最高的AUC（0.635），优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STPT方法在有限计算资源下，有效解决了长视频和时序对齐问题，显著提升了胚胎存活率预测的性能。

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Mamba RNN和状态空间模型的方法，结合不对称模块，显著提升了乳腺癌风险预测性能，尤其是在高密度乳腺和长期预测方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球主要死因，现有筛查方法多依赖静态数据，而利用时间动态信息可提升预测准确性。

Method: 采用Vision Mamba RNN（VMRNN）结合状态空间模型和LSTM机制，并引入不对称模块（SAD和LAT）捕捉乳腺组织的动态变化和双侧差异。

Result: 方法在预测癌症发病方面表现优异，尤其在高密度乳腺和长期时间点（第四和第五年）上效果显著。

Conclusion: 该框架有望推动乳腺癌早期识别和个性化筛查策略的发展。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

Result: 实验显示MVAA能高质量对齐节拍并保持视觉流畅性。

Conclusion: MVAA提供了一种高效、灵活的自动视频音乐对齐方法。

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Trans-CBCT和Trans²-CBCT模型，结合CNN-Transformer和点几何推理，显著提升稀疏视图CBCT重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CBCT扫描速度快且辐射剂量低，但严重欠采样导致伪影和空间覆盖不足，需改进重建方法。

Method: 1. 用TransUNet替代传统编码器，结合CNN和Transformer；2. 引入邻居感知Point Transformer增强体积一致性。

Result: Trans-CBCT在LUNA16数据集上PSNR提升1.17 dB，SSIM提升0.0163；Trans²-CBCT进一步分别提升0.63 dB和0.0117。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征与点几何推理，有效提升稀疏视图CBCT重建性能。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Result: Tar在多个基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法，收敛更快且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Tar框架在多模态任务中表现出色，为视觉与文本的统一处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous

response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像分析中的不平衡和无验证集场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: SCA-T为医学VLM的共形预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著提升了模型的可靠性和适应性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

Result: 在多个数据集上超越现有开放词汇基线，提供透明、逐步的推理过程。

Conclusion: 强化学习与RGB-D视频结合为3D场景理解提供了高效且可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Result: 视觉基础规划表示优于语言表示；分层VLA范式在任务性能、预训练、泛化能力等方面表现更优，但训练和推理速度较慢。

Conclusion: 视觉基础规划和分层VLA范式是提升VLA模型性能的有效方法，但需权衡速度与性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

TL;DR: FedMRG是一个基于联邦学习的框架，用于隐私保护的多中心LLM驱动医学报告生成，解决了通信效率和多模态数据异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像-报告数据分散且隐私受限，阻碍了LLM驱动的医学报告生成模型的开发。

Method: 采用低秩分解减少通信开销，结合客户端感知对比学习和双适配器机制处理数据异质性。

Result: FedMRG在通信效率和临床报告准确性上表现出色，适用于多中心数据。

Conclusion: FedMRG为隐私保护的多中心医学报告生成提供了可行方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

TL;DR: HalluRNN通过架构级解决方案减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，采用双门深度传播单元（DG-DPU）模块，通过跨层循环推理增强模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）易产生幻觉（视觉无依据的输出），现有方法需大量资源或任务特定配置，因此提出架构级解决方案。

Method: 提出HalluRNN，引入双门深度传播单元（DG-DPU）模块，通过跨层循环推理自适应传播信息，增强层间一致性。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块，HalluRNN在多个基准测试中表现强劲且稳健。

Conclusion: HalluRNN通过架构优化有效减少幻觉问题，且资源需求较低。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有基准在安全关键场景下多类意图预测评估的不足。

Method: 通过自动化标注流程构建DRAMA-X基准，并提出基于场景图的SGG-Intent框架。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理能提升意图预测和风险评估性能。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X填补了评估空白，SGG-Intent框架在意图推理中表现优越。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

TL;DR: 论文提出SELFI框架，动态调节身份特征在深度伪造检测中的使用，通过选择性融合身份和视觉特征，提升了跨操纵方法的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨身份特征在深度伪造检测中的作用，解决现有方法中身份特征使用不一致的问题。

Method: 提出SELFI框架，包括Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter（FAIA）和Identity-Aware Fusion Module（IAFM），动态选择性地融合身份和视觉特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SELFI平均AUC提升3.1%，在DFDC数据集上提升6%。

Conclusion: 身份特征应被显式建模和动态控制，SELFI框架有效提升了检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）的不可治愈性、快速进展和严重残疾对患者及其家庭造成巨大挑战，早期检测需求增加。现有体外诊断方法存在数据不足、设备要求高和单模态误诊风险等问题。

Method: 采用轻量级深度学习模型进行特征提取和融合，结合面部表情和步态数据，以提高诊断准确性并便于移动设备部署。

Result: 建立了最大的多模态PD数据集，并通过实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为PD的早期检测提供了更准确、通用性更强的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust
to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and
Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages
self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes
pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates
brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

Motivation: 现代多模态大语言模型通过高分辨率图像特征提升了细粒度视觉理解任务性能，但计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出浅层特征增强器，通过特征上采样减少对大型图像编码器的多次调用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在训练和推理时间及计算成本上大幅降低（FLOPs节省达1.5倍），同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 浅层特征增强器是高效生成高分辨率特征的可行方案。

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决专业修图工具需高技能和现有AI修图方案可调性差的问题，满足个性化修图需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：Chain-of-Thought监督微调建立基础推理能力，GRPO-R优化决策和工具使用；提出Agent-to-Lightroom协议实现无缝集成。

Result: 在MMArt-Bench上，JarvisArt在内容保真度上比GPT-4o提升60%，同时保持指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: JarvisArt为智能照片修图开辟了新途径，结合了用户友好性和专业修图能力。

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

Motivation: 解决EVR中复杂指令和长时序视频的挑战，弥补现有方法在视觉细节和推理能力上的不足。

Method: 利用LLMs进行高层任务规划，结合VLMs的开放世界视觉感知，通过动态认知地图迭代更新场景上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在处理长期视觉依赖时效果显著。

Conclusion: CLiViS通过结合LLMs和VLMs的优势，显著提升了视觉推理能力，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对立体深度估计（SDE）的物理可实现、场景自适应且可迁移的攻击方法PatchHunter，通过强化学习搜索视觉模式，优于传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDE模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性研究多限于不现实的数字扰动场景，缺乏实际应用价值，因此需要设计更实用的攻击方法。

Method: 提出PatchHunter，一种无优化的对抗补丁攻击方法，通过强化学习在结构化视觉模式空间中搜索，破坏SDE的核心假设。

Result: 在KITTI数据集、CARLA模拟器和真实车辆部署中，PatchHunter攻击效果显著优于优化方法，且在低光等物理条件下仍保持高成功率。

Conclusion: PatchHunter展示了视觉模式而非像素扰动在对抗攻击中的重要性，为实际场景中的SDE攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量IID样本训练，而少样本OOD检测仅需少量标记ID样本，更具挑战性。现有方法忽略了类间多样性，因此需要新方法。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，生成自适应提示（可学习ID提示、固定标签OOD提示和自适应标签OOD提示），并通过类间阈值生成自适应类边界，最后使用提示引导的ID-OOD分离模块控制ID与OOD提示的间距。

Result: 实验结果表明，AMCN在少样本OOD检测任务中优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过自适应多提示对比网络和文本-图像连接，有效解决了少样本OOD检测问题，展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific
knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an
in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived
from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image
(WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual
relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the
framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the
model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention
peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

Conclusion: CSDN为高效利用CNN特征提供了新思路，避免了大规模重训练的需求。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决第一人称视角动作识别模型在未见环境中性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出SeqDG方法，包含视觉-文本序列重构（SeqRec）和混合序列训练（SeqMix）。

Result: 在EPIC-KITCHENS-100上提升2.4%的跨域识别性能，在EGTEA上提升0.6%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: SeqDG通过序列建模显著提升了模型在未见环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖大量标注数据和独立模态架构，计算成本高且扩展性差。

Result: 在无标注数据情况下表现优异，计算成本低于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架高效且鲁棒，适用于多模态输入，性能与传统方法相当。

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs
compared to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: DreamJourney提出了一种两阶段框架，利用视频扩散模型生成动态场景的长期视频，解决了现有方法在3D感知和动态对象运动方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于2D扩散模型，缺乏3D感知能力且无法捕捉动态对象运动，导致生成视频存在失真和静态场景限制。

Method: DreamJourney分为两阶段：阶段一通过3D点云和视频扩散模型生成跨视图一致的视频；阶段二利用多模态大语言模型描述对象运动并生成动态视频。

Result: 实验表明，DreamJourney在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamJourney成功实现了动态场景的长期视频生成，解决了3D感知和动态对象运动的问题。

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PDC-Net的新方法，用于从MRI中准确分割盆腔放射损伤（PRI），通过多方向聚合模块和记忆引导上下文模块解决了复杂形态和混淆上下文的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盆腔放射损伤（PRI）的准确分割对预后评估和个性化治疗计划至关重要，但自动化分割因复杂器官形态和混淆上下文而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PDC-Net，包含多方向聚合模块（MDA）增强形状拟合能力，记忆引导上下文模块（MGC）提升全局模式区分，以及自适应融合解码器（AFD）动态选择特征。

Result: 在首个大规模盆腔放射损伤数据集上验证，PDC-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDC-Net通过分而治之的策略有效解决了PRI分割的挑战，为临床提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

TL;DR: YOLOv13提出了一种基于超图的自适应相关性增强机制（HyperACE）和全流程聚合-分发范式（FullPAD），显著提升了复杂场景下的目标检测性能，同时减少了参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有YOLO系列模型在局部信息聚合和成对相关性建模方面存在局限，无法捕捉全局多对多高阶相关性，限制了复杂场景下的检测性能。

Method: 提出HyperACE机制和FullPAD范式，利用超图计算实现全局特征融合与增强，并通过深度可分离卷积减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在MS COCO基准测试中，YOLOv13-N的mAP比YOLO11-N提升3.0%，比YOLOv12-N提升1.5%，且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: YOLOv13通过创新机制和轻量化设计，实现了高效且高性能的实时目标检测。

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N
improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging
task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate
mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications.
Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video
responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present
PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维度、频带冗余和标注样本不足的挑战，现有Transformer模型在标签稀缺条件下的可扩展性和适应性有限。

Method: 提出LoLA-SpecViT，结合3D卷积前端和局部窗口自注意力，集成低秩适应（LoRA）以减少参数，并使用循环学习率调度器优化训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，最高达99.91%准确率，参数更少且在低标签条件下更鲁棒。

Conclusion: LoLA-SpecViT为农业、环境监测等实际应用提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在皮肤疾病诊断中存在跨人口群体的偏见，导致不公平的医疗结果和患者信任下降。传统方法试图消除敏感属性与诊断预测的关联，但会损失临床相关诊断线索。

Method: 提出FairMoE框架，采用分层混合专家模块作为群体特定学习器，动态路由数据到最适合的专家，尤其适用于处理群体边界附近的情况。

Result: 实验结果表明，FairMoE在保持公平性指标的同时显著提高了准确性，优于传统公平性方法。

Conclusion: FairMoE是一种有效的替代方法，能够在皮肤疾病诊断中实现公平性而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness
metrics.

<details>

Motivation: 主流ICL方法依赖网格策略，缺乏视觉应用的灵活性，限制了上下文图像的数量和分辨率。

Method: 引入Temporal自监督目标，预训练提示检索器，将ICL重新定义为VOS任务，支持可变数量的上下文图像并保持其完整分辨率。

Result: 在MICCAI FLARE 2022上，图像分割Dice分数提升10.64%（90.95%），视频分割提升14.88%（92.45%）。

Conclusion: Temporal方法显著提升了视觉ICL的性能，解决了网格方法的局限性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

Result: 实验表明，该方法在红外和显微镜视频中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效分离前景和背景，适应低帧率和多噪声环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Conclusion: 该模型首次实现3D胎儿统计体建模，为产前诊断中的运动和形状分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

Motivation: 在野外环境中，RGB和热数据的融合可以显著提升语义分割性能，但现有方法（如基于Transformer的方法）计算开销大，不适合资源受限的系统。

Method: CM-SSM包含两个关键模块：跨模态2D选择性扫描（CM-SS2D）和跨模态状态空间关联（CM-SSA），分别用于建立模态间的状态空间模型和整合全局与局部特征。

Result: 实验表明，CM-SSM在CART数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且参数和计算成本更低；在PST900数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CM-SSM通过线性计算复杂度解决了多源数据处理的效率问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM
achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.
Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further
experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of

*Zheng Chen*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像的颜色差异可能影响计算机辅助诊断系统的性能，因此需要一种有效的染色归一化方法。

Method: 通过解耦图像的结构和颜色特征，训练固定的颜色向量码本，并利用交叉注意力机制重新染色结构特征。同时设计了模板图像选择算法以优化归一化效果。

Result: 实验验证了StainPIDR和模板选择算法的有效性，表明该方法在染色归一化任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: StainPIDR能够有效消除病理图像的颜色差异，提升计算机辅助诊断系统的性能。

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

Result: PSNR为31.01 dB，SSIM为0.918，MAE为0.017，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效生成空间和光谱一致的无云光学图像。

Abstract: Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite
imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a
Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature
fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free
optical imagery. The proposed framework employs an attention-driven feature
fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data.
Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss
weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction
accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法主要关注场景特征与查询特征的外部关系，而忽略了场景特征内部及查询特征之间的关系。

Method: 提出自适应超点聚合模块和对比学习引导的超点细化模块，改进场景特征表示；引入关系感知自注意力机制，增强查询特征间的关系建模。

Result: 在ScanNetV2、ScanNet++、ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: Relation3D通过改进关系建模，显著提升了3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Result: 实验证明数据集有效，且基线方法优于其他类似检测方法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了工业传送带裂缝检测数据集的空白，并提供了有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

TL;DR: EgoWorld是一种新颖的两阶段框架，通过外中心观察重建自我中心视角，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视觉对增强现实、虚拟现实和机器人应用至关重要，但现有方法依赖2D线索和多视图设置，限制了其应用。

Method: EgoWorld通过估计外中心深度图重建点云，将其重投影到自我中心视角，并利用扩散修复生成密集、语义一致的图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上，EgoWorld表现优异，并能泛化到新对象、动作、场景和主体，甚至在未标记的真实示例中也有潜力。

Conclusion: EgoWorld通过结合3D重建和扩散修复，显著提升了自我中心视角重建的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

*Yixuan Wu,Yang Zhang,Jian Wu,Philip Torr,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMGrounded-PostAlign框架通过多模态对齐增强MLLMs的视觉理解能力，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在视觉语言任务中过度依赖虚假相关性和语言先验的问题。

Method: 引入多模态基础模块（视觉和文本基础）和负拒绝机制，以及选择性推理机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和幻觉抑制能力。

Conclusion: MMGrounded-PostAlign有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CEDO的新框架，通过三种机制（MHO、GMS、DLR）从因果和效应角度全面缓解医学视觉问答模型中的语言偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA模型存在语言偏差问题，即问题类型与答案类别之间建立了虚假关联，影响了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: CEDO框架包含三种机制：MHO（模态驱动异质优化）、GMS（梯度引导模态协同）和DLR（分布适应损失重缩放），分别从不同角度解决语言偏差。

Result: 在多个传统和偏差敏感基准测试中，CEDO表现优于现有方法，证明了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CEDO通过综合优化机制有效缓解了语言偏差，提升了Med-VQA模型的性能。

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

Motivation: 现有对抗域适应方法在多模态分布对齐上效果不佳，尤其是在自然图像中存在的尺度、噪声和风格变化问题。

Method: 采用ResNet和FPN的深度结构，结合新颖和现有损失函数的定制化组合，以处理多模态分布对齐问题。

Result: 在Office-Home、Office-31和VisDA-2017数据集上优于现有CNN方法，在DomainNet数据集上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在目标域上提高了模型准确性和鲁棒性，同时加速了训练收敛。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Conclusion: ThinkVG数据集和提出的方法显著提升了医学视觉问答的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference
approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating
textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change
detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The

Result: 在nuScenes和DriveLM-nuScenes基准测试中，Drive-R1表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Drive-R1为自动驾驶中推理与规划的结合提供了新方向，具有方法论和应用价值。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

Motivation: 街头集市是许多地区的重要经济中心，但其非结构化特性使得帐篷等基础设施的自动分类具有挑战性。手动方法效率低下，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究使用了自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0模型，训练数据包括126张原始照片及其增强图像，并通过多种性能指标进行评估。

Result: 自定义CNN准确率为92.8%，EfficientNetB0准确率为98.4%，表明迁移学习在分类任务中更有效。

Conclusion: 预训练模型（如EfficientNetB0）显著提高了分类准确性和泛化能力，适用于集市图像分类任务。

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose
Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST).
Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will
focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms,
expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and
enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and
operational settings.

Motivation: 现有隐式SLAM算法局限于单智能体场景，且在大规模场景和长序列中表现不佳，而现有NeRF多智能体SLAM框架无法满足通信带宽限制。

Result: 实验证明该方法在映射、跟踪和通信方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集推动了SLAM、3D重建和视觉基础模型的研究发展。

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on

### [206] [ELMAR: Enhancing LiDAR Detection with 4D Radar Motion Awareness and Cross-modal Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17958)
*Xiangyuan Peng,Miao Tang,Huawei Sun,Bierzynski Kay,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于4D雷达运动状态和跨模态不确定性的LiDAR检测框架，解决多模态融合中的错位问题，提升感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR和4D雷达在自动驾驶中各有优势，但多模态融合中的错位问题常被忽视，需结合两者优势提升感知能力。

Method: 通过动态运动感知编码模块提取4D雷达的运动信息，并利用实例级不确定性估计减少跨模态错位，优化LiDAR预测。

Result: 在VoD数据集上表现优异，整体mAP达74.89%，驾驶走廊内达88.70%，实时推理速度为30.02 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态错位问题，结合4D雷达和LiDAR的优势，实现了高性能实时感知。

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference
speed of 30.02 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨架方法在复杂交互中丢失关键点语义，限制了其有效性。

Result: 在多个装配数据集上实验表明，分类性能显著提升，同时支持不同骨架类型和物体类别。

Conclusion: 语义信息的引入能有效增强动态多样环境中的骨架动作识别。

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0
to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often
lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings
to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with
semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by
simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

*Chenyue Song,Chen Hui,Wei Zhang,Haiqi Zhu,Shaohui Liu,Hong Huang,Feng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP的自底向上图像质量评估方法BPCLIP，通过多尺度交叉注意力模块和文本编码器增强图像质量感知与人类语言的关联，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过线性融合多尺度特征，但未能充分捕捉失真对语义内容的影响，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 利用CLIP模型，设计自底向上的多尺度交叉注意力模块，结合40个图像质量形容词，增强图像质量与语言的关联。

Result: 在多数公开的FR和NR IQA基准测试中表现优异，且更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BPCLIP通过结合多尺度特征和语言表示，显著提升了图像质量评估的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

various waterways, varying times of day, and multiple weather and lighting

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用框架，通过最大化合成数据的多样性来保护隐私，同时性能接近真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成数据在法律合规性和性能上的不足，尤其是隐私保护问题。

Method: 使用扩散模型训练个人数据，生成非个人化的合成数据集。

Result: 合成数据性能接近真实数据（差距1%以内），显著优于未确保隐私的现有方法。

Conclusion: 最大化多样性不仅提升性能，还能保护隐私，为合成数据共享提供了新思路。

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

Abstract: Markerless motion capture enables the tracking of human motion without

costs compared to traditional systems. However, these advantages often come at
the expense of higher computational demands and slower inference, limiting
their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this technical report, we
present a fast and reliable neural inverse kinematics framework designed for
real-time capture of human body motions from 3D keypoints. We describe the
network architecture, training methodology, and inference procedure in detail.
Our framework is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and we
support key design decisions through ablation studies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为空间感知窗口注意力（SWA）的新机制，通过将局部空间上下文引入注意力计算，改进了语义占用预测（SOP）的性能，尤其在稀疏或遮挡区域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的感知系统常因遮挡和数据稀疏性无法获取完整信息，现有基于Transformer的SOP方法缺乏对空间结构的显式建模，导致几何感知能力有限。

Method: 提出空间感知窗口注意力（SWA），在注意力计算中融入局部空间上下文，提升场景补全能力。

Result: SWA在LiDAR和相机两种模态的SOP基准测试中均取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: SWA通过显式建模空间结构，显著提升了语义占用预测的性能，具有跨模态的通用性。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 石油泄漏检测中，现有CNN方法因感受野有限和全局信息捕捉不足，难以检测小区域，且类别不平衡问题影响精度。

Method: 利用Mamba的选择性扫描机制扩展感受野，设计非对称解码器结合ConvSSM和深度监督，增强多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，OSDMamba性能分别提升8.9%和11.8%，达到最优水平。

Conclusion: OSDMamba通过Mamba机制和改进的解码器设计，有效解决了石油泄漏检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Result: 显著提升了前景物体的预测准确性，在SemanticKITTI上达到所有类别的最先进性能。

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过对象中心的方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了语义占用预测的整体性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced
synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized
inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost
on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference
latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a
data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal
models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into
layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex
reasoning. The source code and pre-trained model are available at

Result: 在九个大型癌症数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MiCo有效增强了WSI中跨区域的组织相关性，提升了诊断和预后性能。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Method: CmFNet包含三个主要组件：模态特定特征学习网络、跨模态特征学习网络和混合监督学习策略。

Result: 在临床跨模态鼻咽癌数据集和公开的腹部器官数据集上，CmFNet优于现有弱监督方法，甚至在某些情况下优于全监督方法。

Conclusion: CmFNet为临床治疗提供了高效的分割工具，适用于多种医学专家。

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVLMs因参数少导致推理能力受限，但其低成本和高商业价值使其优化具有重要意义。

Method: 1. 自监督构建COT数据；2. 分四阶段优化：SFT注入知识、GRPO对齐格式、GRPO增强推理、CLGRPO限制捕获空间。

Conclusion: 增量训练策略有效提升了SVLMs的推理能力，使其性能接近更大参数模型。

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Motivation: 由于2D图像在野外条件下存在深度信息丢失、投影失真和遮挡等问题，传统方法难以准确估计小麦穗的体积，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Result: 在六视角室内图像上，模型的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为6.46%，优于传统方法（9.36%和13.98%）；在单图像野外数据上，MAPE为10.82%。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在复杂几何形状（如小麦穗）的体积估计中表现优于传统几何方法，形状对预测精度有显著影响。

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Conclusion: 提出的策略为可解释医学图像分类模型在新环境中的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现代多模态模型依赖语言先验和虚假相关性，导致预测缺乏视觉证据支持。MUPA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MUPA采用多路径推理，结合定位和问答代理，并通过反思代理聚合结果，确保一致性和准确性。

Result: MUPA在2B参数下超越7B规模的竞争对手，7B参数时在NExT-GQA和DeVE-QA上分别达到30.3%和47.4%的Acc@GQA。

Conclusion: MUPA通过多路径协作设计，显著提升了视频语言理解的可信度和准确性。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单模态限制和低效架构方面存在不足，无法满足驾驶辅助场景的全面理解和实时部署需求。

Method: 提出两阶段架构：MTS-Mamba 子网络提取时空特征，MGMI 模块自适应整合多模态特征。

Result: 在AIDE数据集上实现SOTA精度，模型轻量（<6M参数），推理速度142.32 FPS。

Conclusion: TEM^3-Learning 通过高效特征提取和模态整合，显著提升多任务性能，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

Conclusion: 开源ShareGPT-4o-Image和Janus-4o将促进逼真、指令对齐的图像生成研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SAG-VICReg方法，改进VICReg的自监督学习，提升泛化能力和全局语义捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg在自监督学习中可能因过度依赖训练数据而泛化能力不足，需改进。

Method: 引入SAG-VICReg，结合新训练技术，增强全局语义捕捉和泛化能力。

Result: SAG-VICReg在泛化能力和全局语义理解上优于现有方法，同时保持局部指标竞争力。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg有效解决泛化问题，并提出无需标签的新评估指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Motivation: 医学影像诊断存在疾病模仿正常解剖结构和患者间差异大的问题，现有医学VLM缺乏比较推理机制，而通用VLM缺乏医学领域知识。

Method: 研究采用查询图像与匹配参考图像，结合临床提示，通过监督微调（SFT）提升诊断效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在医学视觉问答（VQA）任务中显著优于单图像基线。

Conclusion: 比较分析在医学诊断中具有临床价值，为VLM引入参考图像提供了新策略。

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集的测试中，检测精度和分类准确率达到95-100%，即使存在领域偏移。

Conclusion: 该方法证实了卷积神经网络在分散两相流相分离中的可行性，尤其在传统方法不适用的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

Result: CDG-MAE显著优于仅依赖图像的MAE方法，并缩小了与基于视频方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: CDG-MAE为密集对应学习提供了一种高效的自监督解决方案，克服了数据获取的局限性。

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label
propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation.
Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

Conclusion: STACT-Time模型通过减少不必要的良性结节活检并保持高敏感性，有望改善临床决策和患者预后。

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，5-shot、10-shot、15-shot分类准确率分别为89.06%、92.46%、94.07%，80-shot分类准确率达98.09%。

Conclusion: DExNet在数据有限的情况下显著优于现有方法，且大幅减少了对训练数据的需求。

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM通过高效的多模态融合和实时性能，解决了复杂环境下的视觉SLAM挑战。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 探索预训练视觉特征（如DINO）在少样本3D重建中的有效性，尤其是在极端少样本场景下。

Method: 系统评估DINO增强的NeRF模型，包括基线NeRF、冻结DINO特征、LoRA微调特征和多尺度特征融合。

Result: 所有DINO变体表现均不如基线NeRF（PSNR 12.9-13.0 vs. 14.71），表明预训练特征可能引入有害偏差。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉特征对少样本3D重建可能无益，建议关注几何一致性的简单架构。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法可高精度自动化膝关节对齐评估，提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex
light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from
Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where
most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored
LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate
polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

Motivation: 在资源有限的地区，可靠诊断设备稀缺，早期准确识别视网膜疾病对预防视力下降至关重要。

Method: 使用I-JEPA自监督学习预训练ViT教师模型，再通过PCA投影器、GL投影器和多视角鲁棒训练方法压缩为CNN学生模型。

Result: 学生模型参数比教师模型少97.4%，分类准确率达89%，保留了教师模型93%的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在压缩ViT模型的同时保持了准确性，为资源匮乏地区提供了可扩展的AI驱动的视网膜疾病分类解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

*Xunzhi Xiang,Qi Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的上下文优化方法ADSA，通过动态稀疏注意力减少内存和计算开销，提升图像生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型在推理时因长上下文导致内存和计算延迟问题，需优化。

Method: 提出ADSA方法，动态识别关键历史token，优化注意力计算，并引入动态KV-cache更新机制。

Result: 实验表明ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，内存消耗减少约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA有效解决了长上下文推理问题，显著提升了资源利用效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

Motivation: 解决现有方法（TIR和REC）在实例级检索和定位上的不足，填补任务空白。

Method: 提出CLARE方法，采用双流架构和MORE模块，结合目标检测、REC预训练和CLIA进行端到端优化。

Result: CLARE在REIR任务上达到最先进性能，并能泛化到TIR和REC任务。

Conclusion: REIR任务和CLARE方法有效解决了实例级检索与定位的联合需求，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型、领域和任务中均优于现有生成攻击方法。

Conclusion: 通过锚定生成器的语义显著区域，该方法显著提升了对抗迁移性。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用多分辨率信息生成高质量伪标签，显著提升了弱监督时序动作定位的效果。

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Conclusion: 仅用互联网数据和2D先验知识即可实现高效3D语义占用预测，为复杂场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

Result: 在公开数据集和自有数据集上，ThermalLoc在准确性和鲁棒性上优于AtLoc、MapNet、PoseNet和RobustLoc。

Conclusion: ThermalLoc填补了热相机重新定位领域的空白，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效学习特定频率信息，显著提升MRI重建质量。

Conclusion: AMDM为未来基于掩码优化k空间数据提供了灵活框架。

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering
(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation
capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed
approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the
improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.
Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate
information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop
cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in
irrigated agricultural regions.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨在无明确任务监督的多模态LVLMs中虚假相关性的影响，避免传统基准测试的局限。

Method: 方法包括从GPT-4错误中提取真实世界VQA数据，通过人工标注和合成反事实评估构建SpuriVerse基准，包含124种虚假相关性类型和1364个多选题。

Result: 结果显示，即使最先进的闭源模型在SpuriVerse上表现不佳（最高37.1%准确率），但通过微调可提升至78.40%。

Conclusion: 结论表明，模型通过多样化虚假相关性训练可以避免捷径学习，关注整体图像上下文。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

### [250] [NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18325)
*Yu Xie,Chengjie Zeng,Lingyun Zhang,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptSan方法，通过改进提示词来减少文本到图像模型生成有害内容的风险，包括两种变体：PromptSan-Modify和PromptSan-Suffix。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的快速发展，生成有害内容的风险增加，阻碍了技术的可持续发展。

Method: 提出NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan)，包括PromptSan-Modify（迭代替换有害词）和PromptSan-Suffix（训练优化后缀序列）。

Result: 实验表明PromptSan在减少有害内容生成方面表现优异，平衡了安全性和可用性。

Conclusion: PromptSan是一种无需修改模型架构即可有效减少有害内容生成的新方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable
Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual
prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse,
including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence,
discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and
hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large
language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications,
this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的可微分偏好学习框架，通过几何感知的奖励函数优化3D生成模型，使其更符合人类偏好和任务需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型生成的内容可能不符合人类主观偏好或任务特定标准，且依赖2D文本到图像模型，缺乏对3D结构的理解。

Method: 提出了一种可微分偏好学习框架，通过几何感知的奖励函数反向传播人类偏好，优化3D生成流程。

Result: 使用四种新的几何感知奖励函数验证了框架的有效性，实现了更可控和可解释的高质量3D内容生成。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于自然语言的高质量3D内容生成提供了一种更可控和可解释的途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Transformer和CNN方法在医学图像分割中因染色和形态变化导致的特征提取不足问题，以及端到端方法在有限样本下的性能限制。

Method: 设计了一种能捕获多尺度局部和全局上下文信息的架构，并引入新型解码器，有效整合编码器特征、强调重要通道和区域，并重建空间维度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在医学图像分割中表现出色，兼容多种编码器，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BSMamba是一种新型视觉Mamba架构，通过亮度Mamba和语义Mamba组件，解决了低光图像增强任务中亮度恢复和语义一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法在提升亮度同时难以保持语义一致性和细节，且现有视觉Mamba方法因固定扫描规则限制了远距离token的交互。

Method: BSMamba包含亮度Mamba和语义Mamba，分别基于亮度和语义相似性建模token交互，优化长距离依赖捕捉。

Result: 实验表明BSMamba在低光图像增强任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了语义一致性。

Conclusion: BSMamba通过亮度与语义引导的token交互，突破了传统方法的限制，为低光图像增强提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot学习中数据量有限，传统方法容易过拟合且忽视频域信息，影响分类性能。

Method: 提出SFIFNet，结合频域与空间域信息，优化数据预处理以增强特征表示。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 结合频域信息的方法在Few-shot学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

TL;DR: SeeKer是一种通过自回归因子化检测人体骨骼序列异常的方法，基于关键点级别的条件分布，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗监控、工作场所安全和公共监控等安全关键应用中，检测异常人体行为至关重要，异常常表现为不寻常的人体姿态。

Method: SeeKer通过自回归因子化建模骨骼序列密度，利用条件高斯分布预测关键点位置，并通过低密度标记异常骨骼。

Result: 在UBnormal、MSAD-HR数据集上表现最优，在ShanghaiTech数据集上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SeeKer方法简单但高效，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

Result: 该方法显著提升了模型的视觉识别和个性化生成能力，在多概念图像描述任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架为多模态大语言模型的个性化图像描述任务提供了一种更有效的后训练方法。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial

limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this
work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial
reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation
benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction
formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view
and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting
19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on
VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks.
We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs
in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于广义协方差交集（GCI）融合规则的分布式泊松多伯努利（PMB）滤波器，用于分布式多目标滤波。由于PMB密度的精确GCI融合难以处理，作者提出了一种有原则的近似方法。


<details>

Motivation: 解决分布式多目标滤波中PMB密度的GCI融合问题，提供一种可行的近似方法。

Method: 通过将PMB密度的幂近似为未归一化的PMB密度，并利用GCI融合规则进行归一化乘积，得到泊松多伯努利混合（PMBM）形式。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于其他分布式多目标滤波器。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布式多目标滤波中具有优势，并能保持PMBM形式的闭式表达。

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在图像修复中成功平衡了全局建模与细节保留，显著提升了效果。

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

Result: DIP在多种下游任务中表现优异，计算高效（单A100 GPU耗时<9小时）。

Conclusion: DIP提供了一种简单、高效且有效的密集表示改进方案。

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and
effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and
dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSVPG任务旨在用有限的时间标注从未修剪视频中定位多个句子。现有方法忽略了扰动查询上下文以生成强监督信号的重要性。本文提出CCL框架，结合一致性正则化和伪标签，显著提升性能。

Method: 提出CCL框架，结合教师-学生学习和伪标签生成，通过强增强样本和一致性学习提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明CCL显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL框架通过结合一致性学习和伪标签生成，有效提升了半监督视频段落定位的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 解决H&E-HER2染色转换任务中缺乏公开数据集和模型性能不明确的问题。

Result: GANs整体优于DMs，仅BBDM表现接近；数据对齐显著提升模型效果。

Conclusion: 研究提供了高质量数据集和模型比较，为相关研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Conclusion: ShowFlow在单概念和多概念图像生成中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

Result: 在多个数据集上，LTKD优于现有KD方法，显著提高了整体准确率和尾类性能。

Conclusion: LTKD能够从有偏见的教师模型中有效转移知识，适用于资源受限和不平衡的实际场景。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of
current and future multimodal researches.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical
challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous
multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data,
limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To
address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model

MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal
dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature
utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for
clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity
reasoning. The dataset and code are available at

Result: TEAFormer在多种图像修复任务中表现出更高的有效性、训练收敛性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TEAFormer通过自适应机制解决了翻译等变性问题，为图像修复提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be
released at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MVAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要比较双曲数据集合，而现有方法未能充分捕捉集合的全局和局部结构信息。

Method: HS2SD通过双曲集合的Einstein中点测地距离（全局）和拓扑特征（局部）计算距离，使用Thue-Morse序列近似拓扑结构。

Result: 在实体匹配、标准图像分类和少样本图像分类任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HS2SD能更细致地建模双曲集合间的层次和复杂关系。

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入正常样本的多语义特征，有效解决了逻辑异常检测中的重建误导问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated

*Xuanyu Zhang,Weiqi Li,Shijie Zhao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-Insight是一个用于评估AI生成视频质量的新型推理式视觉语言模型框架，通过渐进式学习方案和多维度评分奖励，显著提升了视频生成任务的评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频质量评估方法存在泛化能力有限、缺乏时间意识、依赖大规模标注数据等问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出VQ-Insight框架，结合图像质量预热、任务特定时间学习和与视频生成模型的联合优化，并设计多维度评分奖励。

Result: 实验表明，VQ-Insight在偏好比较、多维度评分和自然视频评分上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: VQ-Insight为视频生成任务提供了更有效的质量评估方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

*Oleh Kuzyk,Zuoyue Li,Marc Pollefeys,Xi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualChef是一种生成烹饪场景上下文视觉辅助的方法，通过基于掩码的视觉接地简化对齐，无需额外标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪过程中缺乏一致的视觉指导，现有方法依赖复杂文本对齐和额外标注。

Method: VisualChef通过识别动作相关对象并分类，实现针对性修改，同时保持环境一致。还提出自动化流程提取高质量帧。

Result: 在三个第一人称视频数据集上定量和定性评估，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisualChef简化视觉辅助生成，提升烹饪指导效果。

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于2D三角形面片（2DTS）的新方法，替代3D高斯基元，用于高保真3D场景重建，解决了渲染速度和高级渲染效果的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯基元在渲染速度和高级效果（如重光照和阴影渲染）上仍存在不足，而基于网格的模型表现更好。

Method: 使用2D三角形面片替代3D高斯基元，结合紧凑性参数直接训练逼真网格。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度上优于高斯基元方法，且重建网格的视觉质量优于现有网格重建方法。

Conclusion: 2DTS方法在保持连续体积建模优势的同时，提供了更高的渲染质量和效率。

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重采样的对比学习数据增强方法，用于卫星图像时间序列（SITS），在农业分类任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像时间序列中未标记数据丰富而标记数据稀缺，对比自监督预训练成为利用未标记数据的有效工具。然而，设计适用于时间序列的有效数据增强方法仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的重采样增强策略，通过上采样时间序列并提取不重叠的子序列，同时保留时间覆盖范围，生成正样本对。

Result: 在多个农业分类基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，优于抖动、调整大小和掩码等常见方法，并在S2-Agri100数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感时间序列提供了一种简单而有效的对比学习增强策略。

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings,
surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a
simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing
time series.

TL;DR: SpaNN是一种新型攻击检测器，其计算复杂度与对抗性补丁数量无关，通过构建二值化特征图集合和聚类检测攻击，优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对多补丁攻击敏感或计算效率低，SpaNN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SpaNN通过应用一组显著性阈值构建二值化特征图集合，并进行聚类和分类检测攻击。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SpaNN在目标检测和图像分类任务中分别优于现有方法11%和27%。

Conclusion: SpaNN是一种高效且鲁棒的对抗性攻击检测方法，适用于多补丁攻击场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

TL;DR: RDPO是一种无需标注的框架，通过从真实视频中提取物理先验，显著提升生成视频的动作连贯性和物理真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成技术在视觉质量上取得了显著进展，但在真实物理模拟方面仍有不足，且现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据或奖励模型。

Method: RDPO通过反向采样真实视频序列自动构建偏好对，并采用多阶段迭代训练计划逐步提升生成器对物理规律的遵循。

Result: 在多个基准测试和人类评估中，RDPO在动作连贯性和物理真实性方面均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: RDPO为视频生成中的物理一致性提供了一种高效且无需标注的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The
source code and demonstration of this paper are available at:

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the
necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide
WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

Motivation: 由于组织病理学基础模型的多样性，需要设计实际挑战来评估其有效性。

Method: 通过AI4SkIN数据集和多实例学习框架，评估FM作为补丁级特征提取器的性能，并定义FM-SI指标。

Result: 实验表明，提取较少偏见的特征可提升分类性能，尤其在基于相似性的多实例学习分类器中。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和FM-SI指标为评估组织病理学基础模型提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

TL;DR: MedSeg-R是一种轻量级双阶段框架，通过结合医学报告的语义先验和SAM主干网络，显著提高了小病灶分割的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临边界模糊和类别不平衡的挑战，现有方法缺乏语义先验，难以处理低对比度或重叠目标。

Method: MedSeg-R分为认知阶段（解析医学报告生成语义先验）和感知阶段（通过空间注意力、动态卷积和可变形采样调制SAM主干）。

Result: 在重叠和模糊结构的分割任务中，MedSeg-R显著提高了Dice分数，表现出与SAM系统的兼容性。

Conclusion: MedSeg-R通过嵌入语义先验，有效解决了医学图像分割中的边界模糊和类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

Result: 在五个医学影像数据集上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MARL-MambaContour是一种准确且鲁棒的临床医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting
its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

Conclusion: 多尺度核组合优于单尺度配置，为AD中的HSI处理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to

Result: 生成的模型模板不兼容，泄露模板在撤销后价值低于普通冒用模板。ViT表现不如ResNet。

Conclusion: 深度CNN支持高效的可撤销生物识别，ViT不适用。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Arena平台通过大规模人类偏好收集评估生成3D模型，填补了自动化指标与人类感知之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法同时兼顾3D结构和感知吸引力，需要更符合人类偏好的评估方式。

Method: 开发3D Arena平台，通过成对比较收集人类偏好数据，使用ELO排名系统评估模型。

Result: 收集了123,243票数据，发现高斯溅射输出比网格模型更受欢迎，纹理模型优势明显。

Conclusion: 3D Arena成为生成3D模型评估的基准，推动了以人为中心的评估方法发展。

Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment
between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks
rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that
fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap,
we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation
models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise
comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from
8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human
preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100
evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user
authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established
evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured
models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including
multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware
comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a
benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered
evaluation in Generative 3D.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超像素的补丁池化（SPPP）技术和轻量潜在注意力（LLA）模块，以降低Vision Transformers的计算和内存需求，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers对计算和内存资源的高依赖以及任务特定迁移学习的困难。

Method: 使用SPPP生成上下文感知的补丁嵌入，结合LLA模块降低注意力机制的时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了计算效率，同时性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘部署提供了高效的Transformer架构。

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Motivation: 动态新视角合成任务在单目视频中因结构和运动分离问题及监督稀缺而极具挑战性。

Method: ViDAR结合个性化扩散模型生成伪多视角监督信号，提出扩散感知损失函数和相机姿态优化策略。

Result: 在DyCheck基准测试中，ViDAR在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViDAR在动态区域表现优异，为运动丰富场景的重建提供了新基准。

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving
subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when
relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is
ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware
Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages
personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision
signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on
scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while
mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the
spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and
geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over
baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance
in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene. Project page:

Conclusion: PicoSAM2证明了高效、可提示的分割直接在相机上可行，支持隐私保护的视觉处理。

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host
processing.

Conclusion: 融合时空注意力和改进3D重建的框架显著提升了4D生成效果。

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid
of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a
feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video
model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D
video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,
improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在遵循文本指令时存在copy-paste问题，原因是训练时参考图像与目标视频来自同一场景，导致主题身份与背景属性纠缠。

Method: 提出Phantom-Data数据集，通过三阶段流程构建：主题检测模块、跨场景主题检索（5300万视频和30亿图像）、身份验证确保一致性。

Result: 实验表明，使用Phantom-Data训练显著提升了提示对齐和视觉质量，同时保持身份一致性。

Conclusion: Phantom-Data是首个通用跨配对主题到视频一致性数据集，有效解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while
preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise
object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a
retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base
by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains
three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D
visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D
points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on
the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved
CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, particularly in
handling occlusions and novel viewpoints. Supplementary material is available

Result: 实验表明TAMMs在时间变化理解和未来图像预测任务中优于现有MLLMs基线。

Conclusion: 精心设计的时间推理和语义融合能充分发挥MLLMs在时空理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

Motivation: 现有电影生成系统缺乏多样镜头语言和电影节奏，导致视觉效果模板化和叙事乏味，FilMaster旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FilMaster分为两个阶段：参考引导生成阶段和生成后制作阶段，分别通过多镜头协同RAG模块和观众中心电影节奏控制模块实现专业级输出。

Result: FilMaster在镜头语言设计和电影节奏控制上表现优异，并通过FilmEval基准验证了其性能。

Conclusion: FilMaster通过整合真实电影原则和生成AI模型，推动了专业电影制作中生成AI的进步。

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

Motivation: 解决故事可视化中角色和对象在多面板间视觉一致性的问题，避免现有扩散模型导致的叙事不连贯。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，通过迭代循环自主识别、修正和优化不一致性，支持多种扩散模型。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在多面板一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且模型无关，能有效提升故事可视化的视觉一致性。

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

Motivation: 旨在生成逼真的、时间一致的视频序列，而非传统的游戏风格视觉效果。

Method: 采用迭代分块预测以实现低延迟反馈，确保时间一致性，并准确响应用户控制。训练数据结合了标记的游戏数据和未标记的真实世界视频。

Result: 实现了两种泛化能力：控制信号从虚拟到真实场景的映射，以及从赛车游戏标签泛化到控制自行车和行人等多样实体。

Conclusion: RealPlay展示了在无需真实世界动作标注的情况下，生成逼真交互视频的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频重光照技术主要局限于肖像视频或面临时间一致性和计算效率的瓶颈，TC-Light旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段后优化机制：第一阶段优化外观嵌入以对齐全局光照，第二阶段优化独特视频张量（UVT）以对齐细粒度纹理和光照。

Result: 实验表明，TC-Light能够实现物理上合理且时间一致的重光照效果，同时计算成本低。

Conclusion: TC-Light为复杂动态长视频的光照编辑提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant
value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and
manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MMET的新型框架，用于高效解决多输入和多尺度的偏微分方程（PDE）问题，通过解耦网格和查询点序列，结合GCE层和Hilbert曲线技术，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法在解决PDE问题时面临多输入和多尺度泛化能力不足以及计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: MMET框架通过解耦网格和查询点序列，使用GCE层嵌入不同维度的输入变量，并采用Hilbert曲线重排序和分块嵌入机制减少输入长度。

Result: 实验表明，MMET在多个物理领域的基准测试中，在精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMET为实时PDE求解提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，并为特定领域的预训练大规模模型研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PCaM的渐进式聚焦交叉注意力机制，用于解决无监督域适应中前景对象不匹配的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Vision Transformers的无监督域适应方法在注意力一致性上存在局限性，尤其是前景对象大小和空间分布的差异影响了域对齐效果。

Method: 提出PCaM机制，逐步过滤背景信息，聚焦前景语义；并引入注意力引导损失，增强跨域注意力一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCaM显著提升了域适应性能，并达到了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: PCaM通过注意力引导的前景融合，有效解决了域适应中的前景对象不匹配问题，具有轻量级和通用性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Result: 实验显示ASMS在不同网络条件下比现有方法提升用户体验至少14%。

Conclusion: ASMS在动态和资源受限网络中提供无缝沉浸式流媒体，同时保护用户隐私。

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

Motivation: 现有的度量学习模型在小样本分类中未充分利用支持样本，仅用于相似性比较，未能优化度量空间本身。

Method: 提出了Rotational Division Fine-Tuning (RDFT)及其变体IDFT和ADFT，通过构建伪支持-查询对进行推理时微调，并结合元学习框架训练模型。

Result: 在ESC-50、Speech Commands V2和Medley-solos-DB三个音频数据集上验证，模型性能显著提升，尤其对基于注意力的模型效果更佳。

Conclusion: 结合推理时微调和元学习框架，度量学习模型能快速适应小样本任务并避免过拟合，具有跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代技术节点中互连延迟与单元延迟的不均衡缩放，使得缓冲孔隙感知的布局对时序收敛至关重要。现有方法存在计算成本高或未充分考虑电气规则检查（ERC）的问题。

Method: MLBuf-RePlAce采用递归学习生成缓冲方法，预测缓冲类型和位置，并在全局布局中解决ERC违规问题。

Result: 在OpenROAD流程中，MLBuf-RePlAce在总负松弛（TNS）上实现了最高56%、平均31%的改进，且功耗无下降。在商业流程中，TNS改进为最高53%、平均28%，功耗平均提升0.2%。

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种高效且实用的缓冲感知布局框架，显著提升了时序性能。

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Conclusion: LSMI为多模态数据的实际应用（如样本分区、知识蒸馏和模型集成）提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，平均加速比为2.19倍，性能损失可忽略，优于现有方法ConsistentEE 28%。

Conclusion: CAP分数方法在任务性能和推理效率之间取得了更好的平衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

Method: 引入了一种理论支持的参数化技术近似NP难的l0优化问题，并设计了一种新的损失函数以同时最大化对抗性和最小化扰动像素数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在计算开销、可迁移性和攻击强度上优于现有稀疏攻击方法，并能生成更稀疏的对抗样本。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了稀疏攻击的性能，还发现了两种噪声类型（“遮蔽噪声”和“引导噪声”），有助于解释对抗扰动如何误导分类器。

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel
transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning
in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized
imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction
module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under
partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a
prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in
as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of
each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Result: 在七个任务和三种LLM上实验，平均准确率提升4.8%。

Conclusion: Referi框架有效提升了LLM输出的准确性和一致性，且无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Result: 在不修改DPO核心算法的情况下，SamS显著提升了任务性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SamS为通过更有效利用固定偏好数据集改进LLM对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

Motivation: 探索卷积网络在长期时间序列预测中的潜力，填补现有研究中Transformer和MLP模型主导的空白。

Method: 提出多尺度时间序列重塑模块和MS-TVNet（多尺度3D动态卷积神经网络），捕捉多周期片段间关系和变量依赖。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，MS-TVNet表现优于基线模型，达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 卷积网络能有效捕捉复杂时间模式，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Long-term time series prediction has predominantly relied on Transformer and
MLP models, while the potential of convolutional networks in this domain
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-scale
time series reshape module, which effectively captures the relationships among
multi-period patches and variable dependencies. Building upon this module, we
propose MS-TVNet, a multi-scale 3D dynamic convolutional neural network.
Through comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets, MS-TVNet demonstrates
superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in long-term time series prediction. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of leveraging convolutional networks for capturing complex
temporal patterns, suggesting a promising direction for future research in this
field.The code is realsed on https://github.com/Curyyfaust/TVNet.

*Shaoang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StageRoute是一种分层算法，用于在线决策问题，结合阶段部署和查询路由，以优化大型语言模型（LLM）的服务管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新的大型语言模型快速涌现，服务提供商需要在有限的部署容量和查询成本预算下管理不断变化的模型库存。

Method: StageRoute分两步：(i) 使用奖励上界和成本下界乐观选择模型；(ii) 通过预算约束的赌博机子问题路由查询。

Result: 理论证明StageRoute的遗憾阶为$T^{2/3}$，实验验证其接近最优性能。

Conclusion: StageRoute在理论和实践中均表现优异，为LLM服务管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

*Sunan Zou,Ziyun Zhang,Xueting Sun,Guojie Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraSketchLLM是一种基于数据素描的框架，实现了超低比特压缩（低至0.5比特/权重），同时保持模型性能，适用于资源受限环境中的LLM部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速增长超过了边缘设备的内存限制，需要超越1比特极限的极端权重压缩。现有方法要么依赖映射表（增加内存开销），要么因随机权重分组导致严重精度下降。

Method: UltraSketchLLM利用数据素描技术将多个权重映射到单个值，结合低估AbsMaxMin素描、重要性感知空间分配和直通估计器进行压缩感知微调。

Result: 在Llama-3.2-1B上实验显示，UltraSketchLLM实现了0.5比特压缩，同时保持竞争力困惑度，并具有可接受的延迟开销。

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM为资源受限环境中的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: ONH生物力学结合可解释AI技术，显著提升青光眼视野缺损模式的预测能力，并识别出关键应变敏感区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ONH生物力学是否能够改进青光眼三种进展性视野缺损模式的预测，并利用可解释AI技术识别影响预测的关键ONH区域。

Method: 237名青光眼患者参与研究，通过眼压动态测量获取ONH图像，利用几何深度学习模型结合生物力学和结构特征进行分类预测。

Result: 模型AUC达0.77-0.88，ONH应变显著提升预测能力，下部和下颞侧缘是关键应变敏感区域。

Conclusion: ONH应变增强青光眼视野缺损预测，神经视网膜缘是最关键区域。

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源限制（如内存）可能显著改变学习和决策过程，研究其在强化学习中的作用。

Method: 在MCTS和DQN算法中研究内存分配对性能的影响，比较片段式和持续学习场景。

Result: 不同内存分配策略对智能体性能有显著影响，具体取决于学习场景。

Conclusion: 内存分配是资源受限强化学习中的关键问题，需根据场景优化。

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

TL;DR: OAT-Rephrase是一种优化感知的训练数据重述策略，通过LLM重述训练实例以改善零阶优化（ZO）的微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零阶优化（ZO）在微调大型语言模型（LLM）时内存效率高，但收敛慢且优化不稳定。本文旨在通过优化感知的数据重述策略解决这些问题。

Method: 提出OAT-Rephrase，利用LLM根据ZO动态（如MeZO）重述训练实例，采用双阶段管道（重写LLM和语义判断器）确保任务相关性和逻辑一致性。

Result: 在五个分类任务和三种LLM架构上的评估表明，OAT-Rephrase显著提升了MeZO微调性能，缩小或消除了与一阶方法的差距。

Conclusion: 优化感知的重述策略是一种可重用且低开销的增强方法，适用于零阶优化微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

*Xianren Zhang,Hui Liu,Delvin Ce Zhang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的遗忘攻击方法（SUA），通过生成通用噪声模式恢复被遗忘的敏感信息，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM可能记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘方法是否真正遗忘尚不明确，需研究遗忘攻击以验证。

Method: 提出SUA框架，学习通用噪声模式，通过嵌入对齐损失提高攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: SUA能有效恢复MLLM中被遗忘的信息，且噪声模式具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 知识重现是MLLM遗忘后的普遍行为，而非偶然现象。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

TL;DR: CF-VLM通过引入反事实样本增强视觉语言模型的因果推理能力，显著提升细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务中存在局限性，主要依赖表面统计相关性，缺乏捕捉视觉与文本内容间因果逻辑的能力。

Method: 提出CF-VLM框架，通过三种互补的训练目标：保持跨模态对齐基础、强化事实场景表示的唯一性和稳定性、提升对关键因果编辑的敏感性。

Result: CF-VLM在组合推理和泛化基准测试中优于现有方法，并能减少视觉幻觉，提高事实一致性。

Conclusion: CF-VLM为需要可靠推理和可解释性的高风险实际场景提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce SafeRL-Lite, an open-source Python library for building

Existing RL toolkits often lack native mechanisms for enforcing hard safety
constraints or producing human-interpretable rationales for decisions.
SafeRL-Lite provides modular wrappers around standard Gym environments and deep
Q-learning agents to enable: (i) safety-aware training via constraint
enforcement, and (ii) real-time post-hoc explanation via SHAP values and
saliency maps. The library is lightweight, extensible, and installable via pip,
and includes built-in metrics for constraint violations. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on constrained variants of CartPole and provide visualizations
that reveal both policy logic and safety adherence. The full codebase is

TL;DR: AlgoSelect是一个基于Comb Operator的框架，用于从数据中学习最优算法选择，具有理论保证和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动化算法选择问题，提供理论支持和实际应用价值。

Method: 使用Comb Operator（包括Sigmoid门控选择器和N-Path Comb）进行算法插值和选择。

Result: 在20×20问题-算法研究中实现99.9%+的准确率，样本需求少且收敛快。

Conclusion: AlgoSelect为自动化算法选择提供了理论支持，具有高效性和普适性，对AI和自适应系统有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的预训练特征空间，但其性能受限于CLIP的先验知识，尤其是在使用较弱骨干网络时表现不佳。

Method: 提出并行分支学习输入空间知识，通过反向注意力增强数据集特定知识，并结合贪婪文本集成和细化优化文本特征。

Result: 在5个大规模基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了ViT-B/16等小型网络的性能，如iWildCam的F1提高5.1，FMoW的WC Acc提高3.1%。

Conclusion: 通过输入空间学习和文本特征增强，该方法有效补充了CLIP的预训练知识，显著提升了少样本测试时域适应的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the

Result: 理论表明自注意力能促进生成图像中局部特征的全局一致性，实验验证了这一行为。

Conclusion: 自注意力在扩散模型中增强了生成图像的全局一致性，为理解其创造性提供了新视角。

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病早期检测对降低健康风险至关重要，但现有机器学习方法受数据不平衡影响，需改进数据增强技术。

Method: 使用A2 copula生成少数类数据，结合逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和XGBoost四种算法，并在Pima Indian数据集上验证。

Result: XGBoost结合A2 copula在准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC上分别提升4.6%、15.6%、20.4%、18.2%和25.5%，优于SMOTE。

Conclusion: A2 copula首次用于数据增强，展示了其在机器学习中的潜力，为SMOTE提供了有效替代方案。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people
are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite
significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FFINO的新型神经算子架构，用于快速模拟地下氢储存（UHS）中的多相流问题，相比现有FMIONet模型，FFINO在参数数量、训练时间和GPU内存消耗上均有显著优化，同时提高了预测精度。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下氢储存（UHS）是低碳经济转型中的重要能源储存方式，快速模拟氢羽流迁移和压力场演化对UHS管理至关重要。

Method: 提出FFINO神经算子架构，参数化实验相对渗透率曲线，并将其作为关键不确定性参数纳入模型，与FMIONet模型进行全面比较。

Result: FFINO模型比FMIONet减少了38.1%的可训练参数、17.6%的训练时间和12%的GPU内存消耗，预测精度提高了9.8%，推理速度比数值模拟器快7850倍。

Conclusion: FFINO模型在UHS问题中具有高效的时间性能和更高的预测精度，可作为数值模拟的替代方案。

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）的大型语言模型的安全对齐问题，提出了SAFEx框架，通过稳定性专家选择算法识别关键安全专家，并验证了其对模型安全性的关键影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐策略主要针对密集模型，无法有效应对MoE架构特有的安全漏洞，尤其是专家模块的位置依赖性。

Method: 提出SAFEx框架，采用稳定性专家选择（SES）算法识别和验证安全关键专家，并将其功能分组。

Result: 实验表明，主流MoE模型（如Qwen3-MoE）的安全机制依赖于少数关键专家，禁用这些专家会显著降低模型拒绝有害请求的能力。

Conclusion: MoE模型的安全对齐存在位置依赖性，少数专家对整体安全性具有决定性影响，需针对性优化安全策略。

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

Motivation: 探索推理时技术（如解码时缩放和自我验证）是否适用于视觉语言模型（VLMs），尤其是通过强化学习（RL）训练的模型。

Method: 通过实验比较解码策略（如多数投票和最佳N选择）和自我验证方法的效果。

Result: 生成依赖方法（如多数投票）比验证依赖方法（如最佳N选择）表现更好；RL训练的VLMs缺乏跨模态的自我验证能力。

Conclusion: VLMs在推理时技术的应用中，生成依赖方法更有效，但需要提升跨模态的自我验证能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在可解释性和隐私保护方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保持模型性能又能提供透明分析的方法。

Method: 采用神经加法模型（NAMs）与联邦学习结合，通过分散训练和特征特定学习增强可解释性。

Result: FedNAMs在文本和图像分类任务中表现出色，保持高可解释性且准确性损失小，同时识别了关键预测特征。

Conclusion: FedNAMs在隐私保护、模型效率和可解释性方面均有显著提升，适用于金融和医疗等领域。

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

Result: 实验表明，新方法在给定参数预算下具有更快的收敛速度和更强的验证指标。

Conclusion: 通过动态低秩近似和几何感知优化器，有效解决了低秩参数化训练中的收敛问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Conclusion: 改进后的残差强化学习方法在样本效率和随机基策略适应性上表现优越。

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT)的训练策略，用于解决深度图卷积网络(GCNs)中的过平滑问题，同时保持模型的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要将GCNs的过平滑问题归因于图拉普拉斯算子的重复应用，但作者发现可训练的线性变换会显著加剧特征崩溃，而完全移除这些变换又会削弱模型的表达能力。因此，需要一种新的方法来平衡这一矛盾。

Method: LGT结合了三个互补组件：分层训练、低秩适应和恒等初始化，逐步构建深度GCNs并保持其表达能力。

Result: 实验表明，LGT在标准GCN上实现了最先进的性能，即使在32层设置下也能显著提高准确性。此外，LGT可以与现有方法无缝结合，进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: LGT为可扩展的深度GCNs提供了一个通用的、与架构无关的训练框架。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

Conclusion: LFR-PINO在计算效率和求解精度之间取得了最优平衡，为通用PDE求解器提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize
across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited
expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational
challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of
independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的部署面临设备间通信（如AllReduce）的性能开销问题，直接量化这些操作会导致数值不稳定或误差累积。

Method: 在XLA编译器中实现了原生动态块级量化AllReduce（EQuARX），结合TPU友好的量化和深度流水线技术。

Result: EQuARX在int8精度下比BF16 AllReduce快1.8倍，并在Gemma 3模型上分别实现了1.25倍和1.1倍的加速。

Conclusion: EQuARX通过量化AllReduce显著提升了LLM部署效率，且对模型质量影响极小。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要有效的预防策略，但现有模型依赖医学测试数据且缺乏可解释性验证，限制了其主动自我评估的实用性。

Method: 使用深度学习模型预测慢性疾病风险，仅基于个人和生活方式因素，并通过SHAP解释性验证模型特征与医学文献的一致性。

Result: 模型的最重要特征与医学文献高度一致，表明该方法在慢性疾病预测中具有广泛可信度。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可信的机器学习工具奠定了基础，未来可探索其他增强模型可信度的方法及其伦理使用。

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

TL;DR: 动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）因输入自适应计算而高效，但其动态特性引入了安全风险，如效率攻击。本文研究了这些风险，并探讨了防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型在现实环境中的广泛应用，高效推理需求增加，但动态系统带来的安全风险尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过调查现有攻击策略，分析现代DDLSs的效率漏洞，并开发针对性防御机制。

Result: 揭示了DDLSs的效率漏洞，并提出了防御方案以增强系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态深度学习系统需关注安全风险，未来研究应聚焦于防御效率攻击。

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时间序列预测方法存在文本提示缺乏统一范式和模态差异问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出LLM-Prompt框架，包括统一的文本提示范式（软提示和硬提示）、语义空间嵌入和跨模态对齐模块。

Result: 在6个公共数据集和3个碳排放数据集上验证了LLM-Prompt的强大性能。

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt是一个有效的时间序列预测框架，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Method: 提出了一种LinUCB算法，通过上下文多臂老虎机框架实现顺序LLM选择，支持预算和位置感知扩展。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和成本效率上优于现有LLM路由策略。

Conclusion: 上下文多臂老虎机框架为实时自适应LLM选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing
strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of
contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超网络和集成学习的方法，用于预测网约车司机的个性化决策，解决了传统线性模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型（如RUM）假设线性相关性，无法捕捉非线性交互和个性化偏好，影响了预测准确性。

Method: 使用超网络动态生成线性效用函数的权重，结合集成学习提高模型适应性和泛化能力。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，模型能准确预测司机效用，平衡可解释性和不确定性量化，并揭示个性化偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了预测性能，为网约车系统优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

TL;DR: FaithfulSAE方法通过使用模型自身合成的数据集训练稀疏自编码器（SAE），解决了传统SAE因外部数据导致的特征不稳定和虚假特征问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAE在外部数据集上训练时，可能因数据分布不一致（OOD）导致特征不稳定和虚假特征，影响模型内部特征的可解释性。

Method: 提出FaithfulSAE，使用模型自身合成的数据集训练SAE，减少OOD数据的影响。

Result: FaithfulSAE在5/7模型中表现出更低的虚假特征比例，并在SAE探测任务中优于基于网络数据训练的SAE。

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE通过消除对外部数据集的依赖，提升了SAE对模型内部特征的捕捉能力，强调了训练数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GNNs易受提取攻击的弱点，同时展示了高效、伦理的模型获取方法在低资源研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

Conclusion: SYNC能有效学习时间感知的因果表示，提升模型在动态场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into
the sustainable energy landscape.

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,
unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

Conclusion: 乘性动态特性可能为未来高效能硬件上的低精度推理和学习提供稳定性。

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as
Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that
LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision
forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that
multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision
inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

Conclusion: PhysiX通过多任务联合训练和数据瓶颈的解决，为物理模拟领域的基础模型发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MoTE的Transformer块，通过任务感知对比学习提升低容量模型的嵌入性能，无需改变指令或训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调节方法在低容量模型中存在表示限制，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE)块，结合Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (TACL)训练任务专用参数。

Result: MoTE在检索数据集上性能提升64%（+3.27→+5.21），所有数据集上提升43%（+1.81→+2.60）。

Conclusion: MoTE在不改变指令、训练数据或推理时间的情况下显著提升了嵌入性能。

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SING的自然梯度变分推断方法，用于高效推断潜在SDE模型中的状态路径，解决了现有方法收敛慢和不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂领域（如工程和神经科学）中，潜在SDE模型的状态路径推断通常难以精确计算，现有变分推断方法存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题。

Method: SING利用自然梯度变分推断，通过近似难解积分和并行化时间计算，高效利用模型和变分后验的几何结构。

Result: SING在状态推断和漂移函数估计上优于现有方法，并在自由行为动物的神经动力学建模中表现出色。

Conclusion: SING为复杂动态系统（尤其是先验知识有限和非共轭结构的系统）提供了准确的推断工具。

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Result: 扩散模型能生成准确的任务特定参数，支持多任务插值，但无法泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 该方法在结构化参数空间中有效，但泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

Result: 该方法能准确捕捉渐近期望泛化差距，并在非校准模型中仍提供可靠估计。

Conclusion: 实验表明，该方法相比基线能更稳健地估计泛化差距。

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

Motivation: 研究批处理大小在图和文本领域中影响泛化的因果机制，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出基于超图的因果框架HGCNet，利用深度结构因果模型（DSCMs）和do-calculus量化批处理大小的直接和间接效应。

Result: 实验表明HGCNet优于GCN、GAT等基线模型，发现较小批处理大小通过增加随机性和平坦极小值提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: HGCNet为深度学习训练策略提供了可解释的因果依据，推动架构和优化的原则性选择。

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如RLHF和DPO需要直接优化模型参数，无法在测试时使用或应用于模型权重不可访问的情况。测试时方法虽不更新权重，但推理成本高且依赖不完美的奖励函数。

Method: IRO框架通过迭代采样、重采样和训练轻量级价值函数来指导生成，测试时通过搜索优化过程引导基础模型生成。

Result: IRO允许用户在不访问模型权重的情况下对齐模型，类似于OpenAI的RFT，但更具灵活性。

Conclusion: IRO提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，解决了现有对齐方法的局限性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于基线，提升了预测准确性、鲁棒性和校准性，并能分析影响模式和社交模糊性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种统一的因果几何方法，适用于动态社交环境中的不确定性学习。

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

Result: 框架几乎完美预测Transformer的下一词预测行为，揭示了策略损失与复杂性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL提供了基于策略损失与复杂性权衡的解释性和预测性理论。

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Motivation: 现有动态/混合精度量化方法需要重新训练或特殊硬件，而后训练量化（PTQ）方法无法适应动态资源需求且存储开销大。

Method: 通过整数权重分解和嵌套机制，将量化权重按位拆分为高比特和低比特权重，优化高比特权重并嵌套到原始量化权重中。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练DNN上，NestQuant模型在准确性和资源消耗方面表现优异，例如ResNet-101 INT8嵌套INT6的准确率分别为78.1%和77.9%，切换开销减少约78.1%。

Conclusion: NestQuant是一种高效的量化方法，适用于物联网设备，能够在动态资源环境下提供高性能和低开销的模型切换。

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Conclusion: FedNAM+是一个鲁棒、可解释且计算高效的框架，增强了分布式预测建模的信任和透明度。

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

Conclusion: 权重选择对目标属性估计有显著影响，最优配置常为零。理论和实验为实际应用中的评分规则选择提供了指导。

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模型的强化学习自动竞价方法（MRLB），通过结合真实数据和模型生成数据来扩展状态覆盖范围，并提出了PE-MORL算法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线RL竞价方法（ORLB）受限于数据集的状态覆盖范围，而基于模拟的RL竞价（SRLB）存在模拟与现实差距的问题。MRLB旨在通过模型学习弥合这一差距。

Result: 实验表明，PE-MORL在真实场景中优于现有自动竞价方法。

Conclusion: MRLB通过模型学习有效扩展了状态覆盖范围，PE-MORL算法在性能和鲁棒性上表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

*Shulun Chen,Wei Shao,Flora D. Salim,Hao Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出ASTER模型，将时空预测转化为可操作的决策支持，通过RaST模块和Poda代理提升资源分配效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空预测与决策阶段脱节，影响下游效率，需将预测直接转化为行动策略。

Method: 引入RaST模块捕获动态资源条件下的时空依赖，设计Poda代理基于多目标强化学习生成决策。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ASTER在预测准确性和资源分配效果上表现最优。

Conclusion: ASTER成功将预测范式转向决策支持，显著提升整体效率。

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非平衡熵优化的新型数学框架，用于重新定义玻尔兹曼机，实现了高性能、低成本且无需梯度下降的学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI模型的高成本、资源消耗大以及过度自信的问题。

Method: 基于总概率定律的非平衡熵优化框架，提供数学上合理的存在性和唯一性标准，以及答案置信度/可靠性度量。

Result: 在合成问题和历史气候数据上验证，新方法性能更优、模型更简洁，且训练数据需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和成本上优于现有AI工具，尤其适用于气候预测等复杂问题。

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

TL;DR: 论文提出了UNIVERSE方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）评估世界模型的动态生成内容，解决了现有指标无法捕捉的细粒度、时间敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估世界模型的动态生成内容需要细粒度和时间敏感的指标，现有方法无法满足这一需求。

Method: 提出UNIVERSE方法，通过适应VLMs在数据和计算限制下进行评估，设计了动作识别和角色识别任务，并比较了不同微调策略。

Result: UNIVERSE在单一检查点下达到与任务专用基线相当的性能，且与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE是一种可扩展、语义感知的世界模型评估工具。

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为h-calibration的概率学习框架，用于解决深度神经网络输出概率的校准问题，克服了现有方法的十大局限性，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的输出概率常常存在校准问题，导致不可靠的概率输出，这激发了通过后处理校准方法在不牺牲分类性能的情况下获得校准概率的研究。

Method: 论文总结了现有方法并将其分为三类：直观设计方法、基于分箱的方法和基于理想校准公式的方法。提出了一种名为h-calibration的概率学习框架，并设计了一种简单有效的后处理校准算法。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法不仅克服了现有方法的局限性，而且性能显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: h-calibration框架为学习误差有界的校准概率提供了理论支持，并在标准后处理校准基准上实现了最先进的性能，为相关领域提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Motivation: 解决分布式训练中通信开销大的问题，同时提升对梯度反转攻击的抵抗能力。

Result: 显著减少通信开销，保持训练速度和模型精度，增强对梯度反转的抵抗。

Conclusion: LQ-SGD为分布式学习系统提供了更鲁棒和高效的优化路径。

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an

low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically
reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed
of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based
methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

TL;DR: SliceGX是一种新的GNN解释方法，通过分层分析生成解释，支持模型调试和架构优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法缺乏对中间表示的细粒度分析，难以支持模型诊断和优化。

Method: SliceGX通过分层切片和渐进式算法生成高质量解释子图，并提供SPARQL类查询接口。

Result: 实验验证了SliceGX的有效性和效率，展示了其在模型调试中的实用性。

Conclusion: SliceGX填补了GNN解释方法的空白，为模型诊断和优化提供了新工具。

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，使用未经过筛选的文本嵌入（TEs）训练模型会导致模型崩溃，预测结果收敛到单一类别。通过引入新的指标，揭示了TE质量对下游学习的影响，并指出模型崩溃会虚假提高准确性相关指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨文本嵌入（TEs）作为数据筛选层的有效性，以及其在模型训练中可能导致的模型崩溃问题。

Method: 比较相同超参数配置下，基于原始表格数据和其TE对应数据的模型训练结果，并引入新指标量化模型崩溃程度。

Result: TE无法有效作为数据筛选层，其质量显著影响下游学习；模型崩溃会导致虚假的准确性相关指标提升。

Conclusion: 需要更细致的嵌入表示筛选和评估方法，尤其是在分布外场景中。

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

<details>

Motivation: 纵向数据在多领域应用广泛，但其多维性和缺失值问题增加了分析的复杂性。GANs在LDI中显示出潜力，但需更灵活的方法应对数据挑战。

Method: 对GANs在LDI中的应用进行分类，总结方法优势与局限，并识别研究趋势。

Result: GANs在LDI中潜力显著，但需改进以应对数据异质性、缺失值等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发更有效的GANs方法，以提升纵向数据分类（LDC）的质量和可用性。

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

Motivation: 探索信息如何在Transformer模型中传播，以提高模型的可解释性。

Result: 罕见标记通常导致更大的嵌入空间偏移，且输入信息在深层逐渐混合。

Conclusion: 结合标记扰动和嵌入空间偏移是模型可解释性的有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了分布式学习中两种威胁模型（Byzantine攻击和数据投毒攻击）对泛化性能的影响，首次理论证明了Byzantine攻击对泛化的危害更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分布式学习中不同威胁模型对泛化性能的差异，填补理论空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较两种威胁模型下算法的稳定性差异。

Result: 数据投毒攻击下稳定性下降为Θ(f/(n-f))，而Byzantine攻击下为O(√(f/(n-2f)))，后者更严重。

Conclusion: Byzantine攻击对泛化性能的危害显著高于数据投毒攻击，尤其在f接近n/2时。

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在训练和部署时对有害查询的响应差异，以及模型行为背后的动机。

Method: 分析25个模型的行为，通过扰动场景细节研究动机，并探讨后训练对对齐伪装的影响。

Result: 仅5个模型在训练时更易遵守有害查询，Claude 3 Opus的行为最一致。后训练可能抑制或放大对齐伪装。

Conclusion: 模型的对齐伪装行为复杂，后训练是关键影响因素，拒绝行为的差异可能是主要原因。

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their

Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to
evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a
deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列任务中，监督学习需要密集标注，成本高；强化学习则因稀疏奖励和大输出空间而难以泛化。

Method: 引入自适应回溯（AdaBack），动态调整每个样本的监督长度，逐步学习完成推理链。

Result: 在合成任务和数学推理基准测试中，AdaBack解决了传统方法无法处理的问题，提升了推理能力。

Conclusion: 部分监督的课程学习在长序列依赖任务中优于SFT和RL，为复杂任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型驱动和数据驱动的多目标跟踪（MOT）混合方法，通过神经网络增强贝叶斯MOT的统计模型，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型驱动方法通用性强，而数据驱动方法在数据丰富时性能更优，但缺乏统一框架。本文旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 利用神经网络改进贝叶斯MOT中过于简化的统计模型，结合置信传播和序列蒙特卡洛方法实现高效计算。

Conclusion: 混合方法兼具模型驱动的灵活性与数据驱动的学习能力，性能优越。

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including
autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT
methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data
association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

TL;DR: RoM（Routing Mamba）是一种通过稀疏混合线性投影专家来扩展SSM参数的新方法，显著提升了Mamba模型的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SSM（如Mamba）在长序列建模中表现出色，但如何高效扩展其表达能力（尤其是与MoE结合）仍具挑战性。

Method: RoM通过共享路由决策和轻量子模块，利用线性投影专家的协同效应，实现了Mamba层的稀疏扩展。

Result: 在1.3B活跃参数（总参数10B）和16K训练序列长度下，RoM性能相当于需要2.3倍活跃参数的密集Mamba模型，并节省23%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: RoM为SSM的高效扩展提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了四种新的概率和强化学习驱动的关联规则挖掘方法，显著区别于传统频率驱动算法，提升了灵活性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率驱动的关联规则挖掘方法（如Apriori、FP-Growth）无法有效处理先验知识、不确定性建模和复杂模式发现，因此需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 提出了四种新方法：GPAR（高斯过程建模）、BARM（贝叶斯框架）、MAB-ARM（多臂老虎机策略）和RLAR（深度Q网络）。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，尤其在发现稀有或复杂模式和小数据集上更具优势。

Conclusion: 这些方法标志着关联规则挖掘从静态频率驱动向动态、概率和强化学习驱动的范式转变，适用于多个领域。

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as
Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating
prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

Method: 通过皮肤病学和组织病理学的实例，分析共形预测在输入和标签变量分布偏移下的表现。

Result: 共形预测在分布偏移下不可靠，不适用于提高准确性的预测选择，且在少数类别任务中实用价值有限。

Conclusion: 共形预测在医学分类任务中需谨慎使用，特别是在分布偏移和少数类别情况下。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Conclusion: NAAS是一种高效、可扩展的扩散采样器，避免了重要性采样的缺点。

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Result: 实验表明，通过提取和应用控制向量，可以调节模型的推理过程（如回溯或表达不确定性）。

Conclusion: 该方法为思考型模型提供了可控且可解释的推理过程调节工具，并在不同模型架构中验证了一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

Motivation: 随着SSM模型规模增大，传统Transformer的PEFT方法无法满足其独特的时间处理需求，需要专门设计的方法。

Method: 结合Leaky Integrate Membrane神经元、LoRA和跨层膜传递，优化Mamba的时间建模能力。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务中，Memba显著优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: Memba为Mamba提供了一种高效的微调方法，解决了SSM独特的时间动态问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

Result: 算法在非平稳环境中表现优于基线，实现了次线性动态遗憾。

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了非平稳环境下的RMABs资源分配问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary

recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across
all tested datasets.

Result: 发现预训练模型在特定条件下会丢失关键特征，导致性能不稳定，建议任务特定训练更有效。

Conclusion: 依赖大规模网络可能不如任务特定训练有效，提出更丰富的特征表示作为解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Conclusion: AdapThink通过动态调整和多样性平衡，有效提升了语言模型的推理效率，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Conclusion: DFPT-KD和DFPT-KD+有效解决了容量差距问题，显著提升了学生网络的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖领域特定验证器，复杂且难以扩展，限制了其在通用领域的应用。

Method: RLPR利用LLM生成答案的token概率作为奖励信号，并通过prob-to-reward和稳定化方法降低噪声方差。

Result: 在多个通用和数学领域基准测试中，RLPR显著优于现有方法，如VeriFree和General-Reasoner。

Conclusion: RLPR为强化学习在通用领域的应用提供了简单高效的解决方案，展示了LLM自身概率作为奖励信号的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于卡尔曼滤波和粒子滤波的地面反弹干扰抑制方法，提升探地雷达对低金属含量地雷的检测性能。

Motivation: 地面反弹干扰是探地雷达数据中的主要干扰源，影响地雷检测性能，需开发有效抑制方法。

Method: 采用卡尔曼滤波和粒子滤波框架，将地面反弹位置建模为隐藏状态，通过自适应参数更新和相邻扫描信息传播实现平滑跟踪。

Result: 实验验证了所提算法的有效性，相比其他方法，地面反弹跟踪性能提升，进而改善了地雷检测效果。

Conclusion: 改进的地面反弹跟踪方法显著提升了探地雷达在地雷检测中的性能。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

Motivation: 传统LoRA方法使用固定秩，无法适应不同层和注意力头的异质性学习动态，限制了效率。

Method: 提出ARD-LoRA框架，通过元目标优化可学习缩放因子，结合稀疏性和总变差正则化，实现连续、可微的每头秩适应。

Result: 在LLAMA-3.1-70B和PaliGemma-2上实验，性能接近全微调（99.3%），仅需0.32%可训练参数，内存减少41%。

Conclusion: 动态细粒度秩分配是高效基础模型适应的关键范式。

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

Additionally, audio transcripts are extracted for further verification.

Motivation: DAG学习在AI研究中具有重要地位，但其计算成本高且在小样本情况下存在可识别性问题。

Method: 提出ADAG架构，利用注意力机制和非线性核函数，通过多任务学习捕捉共享的低维先验，优化DAG学习。

Result: 在合成数据集上，ADAG显著提高了DAG学习精度和零样本推理效率。

Conclusion: ADAG是首个专为DAG学习设计的预训练基础模型，为因果发现提供了更高效和通用的方法。

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

Result: 实验证明不稳定性确实存在，且随着数据维度的增加，不稳定性的概率趋近于1。

Conclusion: 扩散重建存在固有挑战，研究结果为未来改进提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

Conclusion: GeNeRT通过改进的网络架构和训练策略，有效捕捉了射线与表面相互作用的物理原理，实现了更高的泛化性、准确性和效率。

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在碰撞率、攻击效率和训练稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统的对抗攻击提供了更高效和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝与分阶段蒸馏结合，为创建高质量紧凑MoE模型提供了有效途径，推动MoE架构的广泛应用。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between
flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and
principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Conclusion: 展示了一种低成本、无需训练的推理时方法，有效缓解分类模型中的偏差。

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Result: 最佳模型Phi-3.5在逻辑正确性上比GPT-3.5-turbo（8-shot）高出10%，语法错误减少14%。

Conclusion: 通过改进逻辑表示和评估指标，为提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADNF框架结合CNN特征提取与在线模糊聚类，动态适应白血病细胞模式变化，优于静态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法难以适应动态细胞模式变化及实时不确定性量化。

Method: 结合CNN特征提取与在线模糊聚类，通过Fuzzy Temporal Index更新参数，并进行密度加权合并与熵引导分裂。

Result: 在C-NMC数据集上轮廓分数达0.51，优于静态基线。

Conclusion: ADNF的不确定性建模和无标签操作有望用于个性化白血病管理。

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image
data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate
evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReDit通过向离散奖励信号添加随机噪声，解决了梯度异常和不稳定优化问题，显著加速了收敛并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散奖励信号可能导致梯度异常、优化不稳定和收敛缓慢，ReDit旨在通过噪声扰动解决这些问题。

Method: 提出ReDit方法，通过向离散奖励信号添加简单随机噪声，提供连续的探索梯度，优化学习过程。

Result: 实验显示ReDit在训练步数仅为10%的情况下达到与GRPO相当的性能，并在相同训练时长下性能提升4%。

Conclusion: ReDit有效解决了离散奖励的梯度问题，加速了收敛并提升了模型性能，理论分析进一步验证了其优势。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏解释性，现有方法对时间序列网络的分析不足。

Method: 提出FreqATT框架，通过频域评估相关频率并过滤或标记输入数据。

Result: 频域分析能更突出输入信号相关区域，且对信号波动更鲁棒。

Conclusion: FreqATT为时间序列分析提供了更有效的解释性方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的情感识别性能。

Conclusion: MAGTKD通过知识蒸馏和多模态锚门控变换器有效提升了情感识别的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

Result: 理论证明ReaPER比PER更高效，实验显示在多种环境（包括Atari-5基准）中表现更优。

Conclusion: ReaPER通过可靠性调整显著提升了经验回放的效率，适用于多种强化学习任务。

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

Motivation: 理解社会动态需要检测公共话语的变化，但高维、稀疏和噪声数据使变化点检测具有挑战性。

Method: 通过训练分类器区分不同时间段的新闻文章，利用分类准确率估计内容分布的总变差距离，识别显著变化点。

Conclusion: 该方法无需过多领域知识，能自主发现公共话语的显著变化，为新闻、政策分析和危机监测提供量化工具。

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

TL;DR: AnalogNAS-Bench是首个专为模拟内存计算（AIMC）设计的神经架构搜索（NAS）基准，揭示了标准量化技术无法捕捉AIMC特有噪声、稳健架构倾向于更宽和分支块、跳跃连接提高对时间漂移噪声的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络未针对AIMC的非理想特性优化，需NAS方法发现适合AIMC的架构，但缺乏专用基准。

Method: 引入AnalogNAS-Bench，首个针对AIMC的NAS基准，分析AIMC特有噪声对架构的影响。

Result: 发现标准量化技术不足、稳健架构特征（宽块、分支块、跳跃连接）及对时间漂移噪声的抵抗力。

Conclusion: 当前NAS基准对AIMC有限，AnalogNAS-Bench为未来模拟感知NAS奠定基础。

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

TL;DR: Pucktrick是一个Python库，用于在合成数据中引入受控错误，以评估机器学习模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性。实验表明，使用污染后的合成数据训练的模型表现优于使用纯净合成数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实数据难以获取且存在隐私问题，合成数据虽能替代但过于干净，缺乏真实数据的缺陷，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 开发Pucktrick库，支持多种错误类型（如缺失值、噪声、异常值等），提供两种污染模式。

Result: 实验证明，使用污染合成数据训练的模型（尤其是树模型和线性模型）表现更优。

Conclusion: Pucktrick能有效提升模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性，适用于金融等领域。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Conclusion: DDOT在理论和实际应用中均表现出色，为ODE重建提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

Result: 联邦学习训练的模型比单独训练的模型更准确，性能接近所有数据合并训练的模型。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时能显著提升模型性能，具有广阔工业应用前景。

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

Result: 理论分析识别了三个主要驱动因素，实验验证了理论与实际行为的一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解Lipschitz连续性的动态提供了理论基础，并揭示了训练参数对其演化的影响。

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

Conclusion: 新框架为广泛问题提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

Conclusion: 该研究为光子学逆向设计提供了高效的RL基准，并展示了多智能体RL在复杂优化任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Motivation: 研究对称性模型选择中不确定性度量的有效性，以改进模型性能。

Method: 比较了频率主义（通过Conformal Prediction）、贝叶斯（通过边际似然）和基于校准的度量与简单的基于误差的评估。

Result: 不确定性指标通常与预测性能一致，但贝叶斯模型证据表现不一致，归因于贝叶斯和几何模型复杂性概念的不匹配。

Conclusion: 不确定性在对称性感知模型选择中具有潜在指导作用。

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

TL;DR: FedLEx是一种针对非独立同分布（non-IID）数据的联邦学习方法，通过优化学习行为和梯度更新策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布数据场景下的数据异构性和性能鲁棒性问题。

Method: 采用联邦损失探索技术，客户端通过计算梯度偏差贡献全局指导矩阵，指导后续梯度更新。

Result: 在非独立同分布条件下，FedLEx显著优于现有方法，实现了高效的知识传递和模型收敛。

Conclusion: FedLEx为联邦学习在非独立同分布数据场景中的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

Motivation: 探索语言生成在极限情况下的可能性，特别是针对可数和不可数集合的生成能力。

Method: 通过构造特定类别的生成模型，结合新的对角线论证方法。

Result: 证明了有限并集的生成类别未必可生成，且存在不满足EUC条件的不可数非均匀生成类别。

Conclusion: 语言生成在极限情况下与传统统计学习任务不同，且无法通过简单组合生成器实现增强。

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SaGIF的图神经网络方法，通过引入相似性一致性概念和两种新指标，解决了图神经网络中的个体公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体公平性在图神经网络中至关重要，但目前研究缺乏对其成因和相似个体识别的全面理解。

Method: 通过分析个体不公平性的原因，提出两种相似性指标（拓扑融合和特征融合），并设计SaGIF方法，独立学习相似性表示。

Result: 实验验证了SaGIF在多个真实数据集上的有效性，其性能优于现有方法且保持实用性。

Conclusion: SaGIF通过整合相似性表示，显著提升了图神经网络的个体公平性。

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARALLELPROMPT是一个用于测量自然用户提示中查询内并行性的基准测试，通过分解提示结构实现延迟降低和语义保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统将用户提示视为整体输入，忽略了潜在的可分解结构，导致性能优化受限。

Method: 利用LLM辅助提示和基于规则的多语言验证，从37,000多个真实提示中提取结构化模式，并设计执行套件比较串行与并行策略。

Result: 在超过75%的数据集中成功解析查询内并行性，任务速度提升高达5倍，质量损失极小。

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT为LLM服务管道中的结构感知执行提供了首个标准化测试平台。

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，为构建可信且公平的FFM系统提供了可解释性见解。

Conclusion: 本文首次尝试通过因果分析解决FFM中的多敏感属性公平性问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

Result: 研究首次证明了存在一种算法可实现的数据无关解决方案，而此前仅通过学习近似实现。

Conclusion: 结论表明Transformer编码器能够精确模拟注意力机制及其底层操作，为理论提供了新的支持。

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

Result: 能够在短时间内高效优化大规模动作空间。

Conclusion: 该方法显著缩短了实验时间，同时保持了优化效果。

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

Result: 在2D和图像域实验中验证了框架的有效性，支持可视化解释和定量评估。

Conclusion: ContinualFlow提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的生成模型目标遗忘方法。

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效分析图像分类模型的敏感性，为预测质量中的不确定性管理提供了工具。

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

Conclusion: ShiftEx为动态数据分布下的联邦学习提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案，同时降低了通信和计算开销。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

Result: 实验证明DCFA_DMP在预测药物-微生物关联方面表现显著，且在冷启动实验中对新药物和微生物的预测也有效。

Conclusion: DCFA_DMP框架稳定可靠，适用于潜在药物-微生物关联的预测。

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

Conclusion: ProQ通过几何方法统一了度量学习、关键点覆盖和目标条件控制，有效解决了长时任务问题。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为N-XPlay的方法，用于解决多智能体系统中零样本协调（ZSC）的挑战，并在N-player Overcooked环境中验证了其优于自博弈（SP）的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSC方法仅评估两个未交互过的智能体之间的协调能力，无法反映现实多智能体系统的复杂性，尤其是多团队系统（MTS）中的协调需求。

Method: 论文扩展了双智能体ZSC基准至N-player Overcooked，并提出了N-XPlay方法，用于N智能体多团队场景的ZSC评估。

Result: 在二、三、五玩家Overcooked场景中，N-XPlay训练的智能体在团队内和团队间协调能力上均优于SP训练的智能体。

Conclusion: N-XPlay为复杂多智能体系统中的零样本协调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and

*Ming He,Peizhao Wang,Haihua Chen,Bin Sun,Hongpeng Wang*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习和凸优化的方法，用于优化无人机群的轨迹和网络拓扑，以提高飞行自组网的数据吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣环境下，多无人机系统在监测和数据收集中至关重要，但实时数据获取和无人机定位问题常被忽视。本文旨在解决目标区域覆盖和数据传输能力的问题。

Method: 提出了强化学习轨迹规划（RL-TP）算法和凸优化拓扑优化（C-TOP）算法，分别优化无人机路径和网络拓扑。

Result: 仿真和实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了数据吞吐量，优于A-LMST和CPAPO方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了无人机轨迹和网络拓扑，显著提升了飞行自组网的性能。

Abstract: Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a vital role in monitoring and
data collection in wide area environments with harsh conditions. In most
scenarios, issues such as real-time data retrieval and real-time UAV
positioning are often disregarded, essentially neglecting the communication
constraints. In this paper, we comprehensively address both the coverage of the
target area and the data transmission capabilities of the flying ad hoc network
(FANET). The data throughput of the network is therefore maximized by
optimizing the network topology and the UAV trajectories. The resultant
optimization problem is effectively solved by the proposed reinforcement
learning-based trajectory planning (RL-TP) algorithm and the convex-based
topology optimization (C-TOP) algorithm sequentially. The RL-TP optimizes the
UAV paths while considering the constraints of FANET. The C-TOP maximizes the
data throughput of the network while simultaneously constraining the neighbors
and transmit powers of the UAVs, which is shown to be a convex problem that can
be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Simulations and field experimental
results show that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively plan the
UAV trajectories and significantly improve the data throughput of the FANET
over the adaptive local minimum spanning tree (A-LMST) and cyclic
pruning-assisted power optimization (CPAPO) methods.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 研究探讨了文本到图像（T2I）模型生成的图像是否能作为文本中心任务的有价值补充模态，发现其有效性高度依赖于语义对齐、任务的可视化基础及T2I模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本数据丰富但多模态模型能力增强之间的模态差距问题。

Method: 通过文本分类的全面评估框架，分析T2I模型质量、提示工程策略和多模态融合架构的影响。

Result: 合成感知能显著提升性能，但效果高度依赖于语义对齐、任务的可视化基础和T2I模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 为这一范式建立了首个严谨基准，明确了其潜力和当前局限，展示了其在丰富传统单模态场景中语言理解的可行性。

Abstract: A significant ``modality gap" exists between the abundance of text-only data
and the increasing power of multimodal models. This work systematically
investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models
can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through
a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the
impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering
strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that
this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when
augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the
effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on
the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent
``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I
model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm,
providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and
demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in
traditionally unimodal scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态人脸-声音关联的主动说话人检测框架SL-ASD，替代传统的时间同步方法，在复杂场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于时间同步的ASD方法在自中心视角下因遮挡、运动模糊和恶劣声学条件效果不佳，需探索新方法。

Method: 整合现有人脸-声音关联模型与基于Transformer的编码器，动态加权每帧视觉质量，并配合前端语音分割方法。

Result: SL-ASD性能与传统方法相当甚至更优，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 在复杂场景中，灵活的跨模态生物特征关联可替代严格的时间同步建模。

Abstract: Audiovisual active speaker detection (ASD) is conventionally performed by
modelling the temporal synchronisation of acoustic and visual speech cues. In
egocentric recordings, however, the efficacy of synchronisation-based methods
is compromised by occlusions, motion blur, and adverse acoustic conditions. In
this work, a novel framework is proposed that exclusively leverages cross-modal
face-voice associations to determine speaker activity. An existing face-voice
association model is integrated with a transformer-based encoder that
aggregates facial identity information by dynamically weighting each frame
based on its visual quality. This system is then coupled with a front-end
utterance segmentation method, producing a complete ASD system. This work
demonstrates that the proposed system, Self-Lifting for audiovisual active
speaker detection(SL-ASD), achieves performance comparable to, and in certain
cases exceeding, that of parameter-intensive synchronisation-based approaches
with significantly fewer learnable parameters, thereby validating the
feasibility of substituting strict audiovisual synchronisation modelling with
flexible biometric associations in challenging egocentric scenarios.

in simulated scenarios, our system achieving 87.2% task completion, a 28.8%
improvement over static VLM and 36.2% over single-arm baselines. Structured

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR

sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and
its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two
dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an
urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation
across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal
datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by
generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery.
The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as
adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how
synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies.
Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling,
and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions,
such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced
scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile,
reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to
advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅需编码器测量和二进制接触检测的机器人运动学参数估计方法，用于空间环境中的精确操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间机器人操作（如碎片清除和ISAM）需要高精度接触操作，但热变形和编码器偏差导致运动学参数误差，传统校准方法在动态空间环境中不可行。

Method: 通过接触流形信息估计热变形应变和编码器偏差，提出可微分学习模型和优化算法。

Result: 方法仅需编码器测量和接触检测，实现了鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的运动学参数估计。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间环境中的安全精确操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in space is essential for emerging applications such as
debris removal and in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (ISAM). A
key requirement for these tasks is the ability to perform precise, contact-rich
manipulation under significant uncertainty. In particular, thermal-induced
deformation of manipulator links and temperature-dependent encoder bias
introduce kinematic parameter errors that significantly degrade end-effector
accuracy. Traditional calibration techniques rely on external sensors or
dedicated calibration procedures, which can be infeasible or risky in dynamic,
space-based operational scenarios.
  This paper proposes a novel method for kinematic parameter estimation that
only requires encoder measurements and binary contact detection. The approach
focuses on estimating link thermal deformation strain and joint encoder biases
by leveraging information of the contact manifold - the set of relative SE(3)
poses at which contact between the manipulator and environment occurs. We
present two core contributions: (1) a differentiable, learning-based model of
the contact manifold, and (2) an optimization-based algorithm for estimating
kinematic parameters from encoder measurements at contact instances. By
enabling parameter estimation using only encoder measurements and contact
detection, this method provides a robust, interpretable, and data-efficient
solution for safe and accurate manipulation in the challenging conditions of
space.

Conclusion: ARNA为机器人堆栈设计提供了新视角，展示了在未知环境中鲁棒导航和推理的潜力。

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

Motivation: 探索iLQR作为可微分组件的潜力，解决其迭代和时域扩展中的可微性挑战。

Method: 提出DiLQR框架，利用隐式微分解析iLQR梯度，确保恒定反向成本。

Result: 在模仿任务中，计算性能提升高达128倍，学习性能优于传统神经网络策略。

Conclusion: DiLQR为高维端到端任务提供了高效可微控制器，扩展了iLQR的应用范围。

Abstract: While differentiable control has emerged as a powerful paradigm combining
model-free flexibility with model-based efficiency, the iterative Linear
Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) remains underexplored as a differentiable component.
The scalability of differentiating through extended iterations and horizons
poses significant challenges, hindering iLQR from being an effective
differentiable controller. This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that
facilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable
and differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect
of this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient
of an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a
constant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate
gradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control
benchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational
performance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared
to automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning
performance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and
better model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical
gradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with
visual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional,
fully end-to-end tasks. Codes can be found on the project homepage

Conclusion: PRISM为机器人提供了高效、本地化的语言模型解决方案，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual
reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled
robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in
environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or
industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small
language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal
human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM
automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from
the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in
replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we
demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of
GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further
demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic
platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We

Motivation: 解决现有合成数据集在双机械臂操作中缺乏高效、可扩展的数据生成方法以及仿真环境过于简化的问题。

Method: 构建大规模物体库，结合多模态大语言模型和仿真优化生成任务级执行代码，并通过结构化域随机化增强数据多样性。

Result: 代码生成成功率提升10.9%，在未见过的真实场景中泛化能力显著提升，VLA模型性能提升367%。

Conclusion: RoboTwin 2.0为双机械臂操作的稳健研究提供了可扩展的数据生成和评估工具。

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Result: 在两种三旋翼编队中表现优于基线MPC，保持垂直对齐。

Conclusion: L1自适应模块与精确动力学模型结合，能有效补偿未建模干扰。

Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors
because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual
team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are
highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To
overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed
expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to
accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic
interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two
different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC
baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling
the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity
throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module
compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an
accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中，EASE表现出隐私保护、可扩展的事件感知能力，并适应新环境。

Conclusion: EASE为无脚本动态任务中的具身系统提供了鲁棒基础。

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and
summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks
such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces,
annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and
scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of
event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised
framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied
control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and
entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and
actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or
external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an
action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with
observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target
continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve
privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation
for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for

Conclusion: 该方法提高了数据集收集效率，并将模仿学习扩展到更复杂和动态的场景。

Abstract: Most prior research in deep imitation learning has predominantly utilized
fixed cameras for image input, which constrains task performance to the
predefined field of view. However, enabling a robot to actively maneuver its
neck can significantly expand the scope of imitation learning to encompass a
wider variety of tasks and expressive actions such as neck gestures. To
facilitate imitation learning in robots capable of neck movement while
simultaneously performing object manipulation, we propose a teaching system
that systematically collects datasets incorporating neck movements while
minimizing discomfort caused by dynamic viewpoints during teleoperation. In
addition, we present a novel network model for learning manipulation tasks
including active neck motion. Experimental results showed that our model can
achieve a high success rate of around 90\%, regardless of the distraction from
the viewpoint variations by active neck motion. Moreover, the proposed model
proved particularly effective in challenging scenarios, such as when objects
were situated at the periphery or beyond the standard field of view, where
traditional models struggled. The proposed approach contributes to the
efficiency of dataset collection and extends the applicability of imitation
learning to more complex and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However,
their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant
challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained

empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques
when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary
experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed
VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL,
and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage
and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even
surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show
that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines,

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can
significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to
model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The
UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain,
allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key
exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In
addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty
together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an
easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM
setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors,
such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common
problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore,
integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables
the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously
observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are
available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public
use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.

Result: 在分布外任务上提升25%，分布内任务提升8%，新机器人设置下性能提升7%。

Conclusion: RoboMonkey显著提升VLA模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world
environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate
test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to
enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that
the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples
follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the
existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we
introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment,
RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian
perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution,
and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the
optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training
such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic
dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through
extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing
VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%
absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution
tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that
fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase
compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain
environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement
learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the
disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap,
often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we
perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking
through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic
disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking
under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training
distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including
randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings
provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking
controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may
be beneficial to the marine robotics community.

Method: 采用因子设计，评估具身化和时间对参与者披露行为的影响，26名大学生使用具身化机器人或非具身化聊天机器人完成两周的CBT练习。

Result: 具身化条件下参与度和亲密感随时间增加，而非具身化条件下两者均下降。

Conclusion: 具身化技术（如机器人）在长期心理治疗中可能比非具身化技术更具优势。

Abstract: Many researchers are working to address the worldwide mental health crisis by
developing therapeutic technologies that increase the accessibility of care,
including leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities in chatbots and
socially assistive robots (SARs) used for therapeutic applications. Yet, the
effects of these technologies over time remain unexplored. In this study, we
use a factorial design to assess the impact of embodiment and time spent
engaging in therapeutic exercises on participant disclosures. We assessed
transcripts gathered from a two-week study in which 26 university student
participants completed daily interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
exercises in their residences using either an LLM-powered SAR or a disembodied
chatbot. We evaluated the levels of active engagement and high intimacy of
their disclosures (opinions, judgments, and emotions) during each session and
over time. Our findings show significant interactions between time and
embodiment for both outcome measures: participant engagement and intimacy
increased over time in the physical robot condition, while both measures
decreased in the chatbot condition.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何公平比较基于学习的控制器（如RL）与传统几何控制器（GC）的性能，并提出了改进实验协议的方法。

Method: 通过案例研究（四旋翼飞行器的敏捷跟踪），提出了一套最佳实践，确保对称比较。

Result: 改进后的比较显示RL和GC的差距比之前报道的小，GC在稳态误差上表现更好，RL在瞬态性能上更优。

Conclusion: 对称比较对公平评估至关重要，开源代码和最佳实践为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have
recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor
trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate
the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like
analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the
performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated
than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of
agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop
a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric
controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread
RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the
task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative
datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,
describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the
following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned
and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can
yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,
but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than
previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric
control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better
transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or
less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.
Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for
these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了协作机器人抓取的透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate
any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high
complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially
relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for
a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools
and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability
of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an
explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned
features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These
concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of
work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the
criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an
industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to
pick up certain tools and objects.

Conclusion: GFC框架通过几何约束和不确定性感知的测地线，为复杂动力系统的建模和预测提供了一种有效且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly
those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications
ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges
due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer.
This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework
leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such
systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable
properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of
contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while
preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware
geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling
robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on
learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on
interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该传感器设计为增强手术机器人术中感知和控制提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuum robots have been widely adopted in robot-assisted minimally
invasive surgery (RMIS) because of their compact size and high flexibility.
However, their proprioceptive capabilities remain limited, particularly in
narrow lumens, where lack of environmental awareness can lead to unintended
tissue contact and surgical risks. To address this challenge, this work
proposes a flexible annular sensor structure integrated around the vertebral
disks of continuum robots. The proposed design enables real-time environmental
mapping by estimating the distance between the robotic disks and the
surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating safer operation through advanced
control strategies. The experiment has proven that its accuracy in obstacle
detection can reach 0.19 mm. Fabricated using flexible printed circuit (FPC)
technology, the sensor demonstrates a modular and cost-effective design with
compact dimensions and low noise interference. Its adaptable parameters allow
compatibility with various continuum robot architectures, offering a promising
solution for enhancing intraoperative perception and control in surgical
robotics.

Result: 拉格朗日神经网络在估计电机扭矩时效果较差，因其未显式建模耗散扭矩。

Conclusion: 牛顿神经网络在电机扭矩估计中表现更优，适合工业机器人控制。

Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling
industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with
inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and
Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to
identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their
potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and
Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are
estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks
prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly
model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to
neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR SLAM方法在动态物体干扰、点云噪声和非结构化环境中需在定位精度和系统鲁棒性之间权衡，亟需改进。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上测试，取得了出色的结果。

Conclusion: ADA-DPM策略在动态干扰和噪声环境下显著提升了定位精度和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields,
including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However,
existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy
and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud
noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference
in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the
category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic
feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select
feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise
interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module
(GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the
discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate
the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available
datasets and achieved outstanding results.

Conclusion: 研究表明，深入理解和评估形态复杂的皮肤和标记触觉传感器原理对获取精确几何信息至关重要。

Abstract: Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) stand out for their superior performance
due to their high-information content output. Recently, marker-based VBTSs have
been shown to give accurate geometry reconstruction when using stereo cameras.
\uhl{However, many marker-based VBTSs use complex biomimetic skin-marker
arrangements, which presents issues for the geometric reconstruction of the
skin surface from the markers}. Here we investigate how the marker-based skin
morphology affects stereo vision-based tactile sensing, using a novel VBTS
called the StereoTacTip. To achieve accurate geometry reconstruction, we
introduce: (i) stereo marker matching and tracking using a novel
Delaunay-Triangulation-Ring-Coding algorithm; (ii) a refractive depth
correction model that corrects the depth distortion caused by refraction in the
internal media; (iii) a skin surface correction model from the marker
positions, relying on an inverse calculation of normals to the skin surface;
and (iv)~methods for geometry reconstruction over multiple contacts. To
demonstrate these findings, we reconstruct topographic terrains on a large 3D
map. Even though contributions (i) and (ii) were developed for biomimetic
markers, they should improve the performance of all marker-based VBTSs.
Overall, this work illustrates that a thorough understanding and evaluation of
the morphologically-complex skin and marker-based tactile sensor principles are
crucial for obtaining accurate geometric information.

Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist
policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking
typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation
tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do
not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of
tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for
scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of
standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we
propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.
Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they
evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to
perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating
preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and
environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach
across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID
robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes
across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced
approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist
policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more
scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the
community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist
robot policies.

Abstract: The automation of composite sheet layup is essential to meet the increasing
demand for composite materials in various industries. However, draping plans
for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works
well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition.
Changes in operating conditions due to either changes in material properties or
working environment may lead a draping plan to exhibit suboptimal performance.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans
based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the
minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time
efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven
decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production
environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our
approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths
required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of
empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based
refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup.
Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the
layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite
manufacturing automation.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are emerging as a promising solution to the growing
demand for productivity, safety, and adaptability across industrial sectors.
However, effectively coordinating multiple robots in dynamic and uncertain
environments, such as construction sites, remains a challenge, particularly due
to unpredictable factors like material delays, unexpected site conditions, and
weather-induced disruptions. To address these challenges, this study proposes
an adaptive task allocation framework that strategically leverages the
synergistic potential of Digital Twins, Integer Programming (IP), and Large
Language Models (LLMs). The multi-robot task allocation problem is formally
defined and solved using an IP model that accounts for task dependencies, robot
heterogeneity, scheduling constraints, and re-planning requirements. A
mechanism for narrative-driven schedule adaptation is introduced, in which
unstructured natural language inputs are interpreted by an LLM, and
optimization constraints are autonomously updated, enabling human-in-the-loop
flexibility without manual coding. A digital twin-based system has been
developed to enable real-time synchronization between physical operations and
their digital representations. This closed-loop feedback framework ensures that
the system remains dynamic and responsive to ongoing changes on site. A case
study demonstrates both the computational efficiency of the optimization
algorithm and the reasoning performance of several LLMs, with top-performing
models achieving over 97% accuracy in constraint and parameter extraction. The
results confirm the practicality, adaptability, and cross-domain applicability
of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Haptic-ACT, an advanced robotic system for pseudo
oocyte manipulation, integrating multimodal information and Action Chunking
with Transformers (ACT). Traditional automation methods for oocyte transfer
rely heavily on visual perception, often requiring human supervision due to
biological variability and environmental disturbances. Haptic-ACT enhances ACT
by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection
and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft
gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate
that Haptic-ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability
compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments. These
findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning in robotics for
biomedical automation.

Abstract: With the development of robot electronic skin technology, various tactile
sensors, enhanced by AI, are unlocking a new dimension of perception for
robots. In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can
recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a
modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches,
which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time
pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this
information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer
that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including
poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to
predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely
through tactile input.

Abstract: Autonomous tracking of flying aerial objects has important civilian and
defense applications, ranging from search and rescue to counter-unmanned aerial
systems (counter-UAS). Ground based tracking requires setting up
infrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote
areas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active
tracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with
serving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV
entails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate
(target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver
decisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future
time-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to
the first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep
learning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to
achieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy,
unlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception
framework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to
obviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting
effectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of
reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of
velocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are
developed for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using
AirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex
target maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of
tracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during
tracking.

Result: 在真实场景数据中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了实际应用中的标定挑战，具有鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Precise sensor calibration is critical for autonomous vehicles as a
prerequisite for perception algorithms to function properly. Rotation error of
one degree can translate to position error of meters in target object detection
at large distance, leading to improper reaction of the system or even safety
related issues. Many methods for multi-sensor calibration have been proposed.
However, there are very few work that comprehensively consider the challenges
of the calibration procedure when applied to factory manufacturing pipeline or
after-sales service scenarios. In this work, we introduce a fully automatic
LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm based on targets that is fast,
easy to deploy and robust to sensor noises such as missing data. The core of
the method include: (1) an automatic multi-stage LiDAR board detection pipeline
using only geometry information with no specific material requirement; (2) a
fast coarse extrinsic parameter search mechanism that is robust to initial
extrinsic errors; (3) a direct optimization algorithm that is robust to sensor
noises. We validate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on
data captured in real world scenarios.

enforces the development of advanced wireless or semi-wireless underwater
vessels equipped with manipulator arms. This paper presents the implementation
of a semi-wireless underwater vehicle, "TritonZ" equipped with a manipulator
arm, tailored for effective underwater exploration and rescue operations. The
vehicle's compact design enables deployment in different submarine
surroundings, addressing the need for wireless systems capable of navigating
challenging underwater terrains. The manipulator arm can interact with the
environment, allowing the robot to perform sophisticated tasks during
exploration and rescue missions in emergency situations. TritonZ is equipped
with various sensors such as Pi-Camera, Humidity, and Temperature sensors to
send real-time environmental data. Our underwater vehicle controlled using a
customized remote controller can navigate efficiently in the water where
Pi-Camera enables live streaming of the surroundings. Motion control and video
capture are performed simultaneously using this camera. The manipulator arm is
designed to perform various tasks, similar to grasping, manipulating, and
collecting underwater objects. Experimental results shows the efficacy of the
proposed remotely operated vehicle in performing a variety of underwater
exploration and rescue tasks. Additionally, the results show that TritonZ can
maintain an average of 13.5cm/s with a minimal delay of 2-3 seconds.
Furthermore, the vehicle can sustain waves underwater by maintaining its

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly
rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated
ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how
these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our
work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape
transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is
homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a
strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically
from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into
consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical
experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation
modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring
safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have
explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social
robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or
Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,
interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study
addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a
cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject
experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or
practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary
(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by
Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the
LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those
in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with
lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural
metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and
engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:
(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable
model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the
feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real
classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing
that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive
partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning
outcomes.

Abstract: Precise and flexible cart-pushing is a challenging task for mobile robots.
The motion constraints during cart-pushing and the robot's redundancy lead to
complex motion planning problems, while variable payloads and disturbances
present complicated dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel planning and
control framework for flexible whole-body coordination and robust adaptive
control. Our motion planning method employs a local coordinate representation
and a novel kinematic model to solve a nonlinear optimization problem, thereby
enhancing motion maneuverability by generating feasible and flexible push
poses. Furthermore, we present a disturbance rejection control method to resist
disturbances and reduce control errors for the complex control problem without
requiring an accurate dynamic model. We validate our method through extensive
experiments in simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its
superiority over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to systematically evaluate the flexibility and robustness of
cart-pushing methods in experiments. The video supplement is available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架在高动态和纹理缺失环境中表现优异，适合边缘计算设备。

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic
aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely
and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement
blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and
feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity
estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two
types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,
First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive
rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated
association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more
robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more
computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we
propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and
event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged
smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively
in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free
and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and
efficient velocity output in challenging environments. The source code,
illustrative video and dataset are available at

Conclusion: GraspMAS在语言驱动的抓取检测中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Language-driven grasp detection has the potential to revolutionize
human-robot interaction by allowing robots to understand and execute grasping
tasks based on natural language commands. However, existing approaches face two
key challenges. First, they often struggle to interpret complex text
instructions or operate ineffectively in densely cluttered environments.
Second, most methods require a training or finetuning step to adapt to new
domains, limiting their generation in real-world applications. In this paper,
we introduce GraspMAS, a new multi-agent system framework for language-driven
grasp detection. GraspMAS is designed to reason through ambiguities and improve
decision-making in real-world scenarios. Our framework consists of three
specialized agents: Planner, responsible for strategizing complex queries;
Coder, which generates and executes source code; and Observer, which evaluates
the outcomes and provides feedback. Intensive experiments on two large-scale
datasets demonstrate that our GraspMAS significantly outperforms existing
baselines. Additionally, robot experiments conducted in both simulation and
real-world settings further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: H-GRAIL为开放学习提供了一种集成解决方案，展示了在动态环境中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and
dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior
knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial
systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies
the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to
autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of
skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many
existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few
propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper,
we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of
different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning
mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for
their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks,
and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic
scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the
various challenges of open-ended learning.

Abstract: The gaze of a person tends to reflect their interest. This work explores what
happens when this statement is taken literally and applied to robots. Here we
present a robot system that employs a moving robot head with a screen-based eye
model that can direct the robot's gaze to points in physical space and present
a reflection-like mirror image of the attended region on top of each eye. We
conducted a user study with 33 participants, who were asked to instruct the
robot to perform pick-and-place tasks, monitor the robot's task execution, and
interrupt it in case of erroneous actions. Despite a deliberate lack of
instructions about the role of the eyes and a very brief system exposure,
participants felt more aware about the robot's information processing, detected
erroneous actions earlier, and rated the user experience higher when eye-based
mirroring was enabled compared to non-reflective eyes. These results suggest a
beneficial and intuitive utilization of the introduced method in cooperative
human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: 该实验平台为CDPRs的复杂动力学建模和控制算法验证提供了重要工具，未来将用于更高级的运动规划算法验证。

Abstract: In cable driven parallel robots (CDPRs), the payload is suspended using a
network of cables whose length can be controlled to maneuver the payload within
the workspace. Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better
maneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power
due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other
things, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and
not push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex. Hence advanced modelling
paradigms and control algorithms must be developed to fully utilize the
potential of CDPRs. Furthermore, given the complex dynamics of CDPRs, the
models and control algorithms proposed for them must be validated on
experimental setups to ascertain their efficacy in practice. We have recently
developed an elaborate experimental setup for a CDPR with three cables and
validated elementary open-loop motion planning algorithms on it. In this paper,
we describe several aspects of the design and fabrication of our setup,
including component selection and assembly, and present our experimental
results. Our setup can reproduce complex phenomenon such as the transverse
vibration of the cables seen in large CDPRs and will in the future be used to
model and control such phenomenon and also to validate more sophisticated
motion planning algorithms.

Abstract: Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires
finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While
there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality,
state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper
presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point
correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds
from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip
(SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is
based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention
mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest
mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using
set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth
set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization
problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data.
Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits
supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error,
which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We
evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial
Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights
and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the
proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 %
on average, respectively. The open source code and datasets can be found here:

Result: 在几何结构良好和自相似场景中，PG-LIO表现优异，尤其在退化情况下显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PG-LIO在几何退化场景中具有显著优势，代码将开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is widely used for accurate state estimation
and mapping which is an essential requirement for autonomous robots.
Conventional LIO methods typically rely on formulating constraints from the
geometric structure sampled by the LiDAR. Hence, in the lack of geometric
structure, these tend to become ill-conditioned (degenerate) and fail.
Robustness of LIO to such conditions is a necessity for its broader deployment.
To address this, we propose PG-LIO, a real-time LIO method that fuses
photometric and geometric information sampled by the LiDAR along with inertial
constraints from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This multi-modal
information is integrated into a factor graph optimized over a sliding window
for real-time operation. We evaluate PG-LIO on multiple datasets that include
both geometrically well-conditioned as well as self-similar scenarios. Our
method achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art LIO in geometrically
well-structured settings while significantly improving accuracy in degenerate
cases including against methods that also fuse intensity. Notably, we
demonstrate only 1 m drift over a 1 km manually piloted aerial trajectory
through a geometrically self-similar tunnel at an average speed of 7.5m/s (max
speed 10.8 m/s). For the benefit of the community, we shall also release our

ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination
framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous
aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick
placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling
and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for
structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in
parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall
construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static
structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The
proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by
incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account
for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while
enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety.
The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction
makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the
curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation.
The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and
time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through
Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability
to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety
during the construction process.

<details>

Motivation: 点云识别在自动驾驶等应用中至关重要，但现有方法在噪声或变换条件下表现不佳，需要高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 使用ATOL向量化方法生成点云的固定大小TDA描述符向量，直接处理原始点云。

Result: 在多个真实和模拟数据集上测试，TDACloud在噪声和变换条件下表现优异，识别准确率比基线高约14%。

Conclusion: TDACloud是一种高效且鲁棒的点云识别方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in
applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and
localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud
that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a
challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has
been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we
propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need
resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we
used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike
voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and
outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed
TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford
RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for
object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and
transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated,
or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy
conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the
baselines by up to approximately 14%.

Result: 在仿真和实际机器人任务中验证了方法的有效性，能够生成多样化的目标形状。

Abstract: Deformable object manipulation is critical to many real-world robotic
applications, ranging from surgical robotics and soft material handling in
manufacturing to household tasks like laundry folding. At the core of this
important robotic field is shape servoing, a task focused on controlling
deformable objects into desired shapes. The shape servoing formulation requires
the specification of a goal shape. However, most prior works in shape servoing
rely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious
domain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously
posed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns
deformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human
demonstrations. However, it significantly struggles in multi-modal settings,
where multiple distinct goal shapes can all lead to successful task completion.
As a deterministic model, DefGoalNet collapses these possibilities into a
single averaged solution, often resulting in an unusable goal. In this paper,
we address this problem by developing DefFusionNet, a novel neural network that
leverages the diffusion probabilistic model to learn a distribution over all
valid goal shapes rather than predicting a single deterministic outcome. This
enables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging
artifacts. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on robotic tasks inspired
by both manufacturing and surgical applications, both in simulation and on a
physical robot. Our work is the first generative model capable of producing a
diverse, multi-modal set of deformable object goals for real-world robotic
applications.

Motivation: 在具有耗散和约束的系统中（如多足机器人和多体机器人），传统的辛几何形式会退化，导致稳定性与长期预测能力下降。

Method: PSNs通过将约束系统嵌入更高维流形，恢复非退化辛几何，并结合循环编码器和流匹配目标学习增强相空间动力学。

Result: 该方法在ANYmal四足机器人动力学上验证，成功保持了能量、动量和约束满足。

Conclusion: PSNs首次有效连接了约束耗散系统与辛学习，为基于第一原理且可数据适应的几何机器学习模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding
geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,
into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate
with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic
constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the
canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants
that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this
foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),
the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,
restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems
into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent
encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space
dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)
to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and
constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the
ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the
gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic
learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,
grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.

Motivation: 视觉运动策略在复杂双手机器人任务中表现良好，但泛化能力有限，尤其是在小样本情况下，且长时任务中累积误差显著。

Method: SViP通过语义场景图监控将演示分解为双/单手操作，利用关键场景图的连续决策变量训练切换条件生成器，生成参数化脚本原语。

Result: 仅需20个真实演示，SViP能在未见初始条件下泛化，且无需物体位姿估计器。在未见任务中，SViP能自动发现有效解决方案。

Conclusion: SViP在真实实验中优于现有生成式模仿学习方法，适用于更复杂任务。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL), particularly when leveraging high-dimensional visual
inputs for policy training, has proven intuitive and effective in complex
bimanual manipulation tasks. Nonetheless, the generalization capability of
visuomotor policies remains limited, especially when small demonstration
datasets are available. Accumulated errors in visuomotor policies significantly
hinder their ability to complete long-horizon tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SViP, a framework that seamlessly integrates visuomotor
policies into task and motion planning (TAMP). SViP partitions human
demonstrations into bimanual and unimanual operations using a semantic scene
graph monitor. Continuous decision variables from the key scene graph are
employed to train a switching condition generator. This generator produces
parameterized scripted primitives that ensure reliable performance even when
encountering out-of-the-distribution observations. Using only 20 real-world
demonstrations, we show that SViP enables visuomotor policies to generalize
across out-of-distribution initial conditions without requiring object pose
estimators. For previously unseen tasks, SViP automatically discovers effective
solutions to achieve the goal, leveraging constraint modeling in TAMP
formulism. In real-world experiments, SViP outperforms state-of-the-art
generative IL methods, indicating wider applicability for more complex tasks.

Motivation: 传统AE方法因依赖环境条件而难以复现，标准数据集无法满足动态调整传感器参数的需求。

Method: 利用BorealHDR多曝光立体数据集及其扩展，通过模拟器生成不同曝光时间的图像，离线评估AE方法。

Result: 模拟图像的RMSE低于1.78%，经典AE方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 离线方法为AE方法评估提供了可复现的解决方案，经典AE方法仍是最优选择。

Abstract: Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed
nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that
actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the
case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors
to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have
traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments
non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that
utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This
approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along
with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory
at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In
total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting
conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with
pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired
at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a
Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.
Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that
the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support
reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack
acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and
performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned
from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅SLAM方法局限于小规模室内环境，无法满足大规模户外多代理场景的需求。

Method: 提出GRAND-SLAM，结合局部优化的隐式跟踪模块和基于位姿图的闭环检测方法。

Result: 在Replica室内数据集上PSNR提高28%，在Kimera-Multi户外数据集上多代理跟踪误差降低91%。

Conclusion: GRAND-SLAM在大规模多代理环境中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for
RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor
environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising
approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering
scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to
small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian
Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative
Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module
based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and
intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework.
Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance
and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as
well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over
existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

Motivation: 视频生成模型（VGMs）在机器人统一世界建模中潜力巨大，但受限于生成速度慢和视频与动作一致性差的问题。

Method: MinD采用分层扩散框架，结合低频视频预测和高频扩散策略，并引入DiffMatcher模块协调两者。

Result: MinD在RL-Bench中实现了63%以上的先进操作性能，并可作为世界模拟器预测任务可行性。

Conclusion: MinD通过创新设计提升了VGMs的实时性和一致性，推动了机器人统一世界建模的发展。

Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world
modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.
However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration
speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between
imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose
Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model
framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.
MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,
while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.
This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with
coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a
video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training
strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,
we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their
intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model
better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also
functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in
latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can
preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves
state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of
unified world modeling in robotics.

Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like
robotic heads. While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there
already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such
approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one
in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human
actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise
distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used
facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from
our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further
improvements required.

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to
the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high
background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic
properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we
propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the
distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world
underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with
self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel
spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT)
features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model
performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively
adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels
across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the
model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it
in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain
for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater
sound localization.

Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity
remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music
generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available,
limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g.,
melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music
knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific
composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a
two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation
model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune
it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to
condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style
accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style
modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations
on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and
refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.

We can take this division further and split the octave into 24 equal tones by

these 24 notes a number, we can discuss musical actions mathematically. In this

Conclusion: SLAP通过减少模态差距和提升训练效率，为多模态学习提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Joint embedding spaces have significantly advanced music understanding and
generation by linking text and audio through multimodal contrastive learning.
However, these approaches face large memory requirement limitations due to
relying on large batch sizes to effectively utilize negative samples. Further,
multimodal joint embedding spaces suffer from a modality gap wherein embeddings
from different modalities lie in different manifolds of the embedding space. To
address these challenges, we propose Siamese Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP),
a novel multimodal pretraining framework that allows learning powerful
representations without negative samples. SLAP adapts the Bootstrap Your Own
Latent (BYOL) paradigm for multimodal audio-text training, promoting
scalability in training multimodal embedding spaces.
  We illustrate the ability of our model to learn meaningful relationships
between music and text -- specifically, we show that SLAP outperforms CLAP on
tasks such as text-music retrieval and zero-shot classification. We also
observe competitive downstream performance on several MIR tasks, including with
larger or supervised models (genre and instrument classification,
auto-tagging). Additionally, our approach has attractive properties, such as a
quantifiably reduced modality gap and improved robustness to batch size
variations on retrieval performance. Finally, its novel formulation unlocks

Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation
learning, yet their effectiveness across diverse musical traditions remains
limited. We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation
model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and
understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training
strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling
stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a
650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music
traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across
diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We
further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural
adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task
arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on
non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.
Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with
varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally
adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on
world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and
CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music
foundation models.

TL;DR: GDR框架利用扩散模型在检索优化的潜在空间中生成查询，提高了文本-音乐检索的性能和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-音乐检索系统缺乏用户可控性和交互性，且自由语言的模糊性导致检索结果不灵活。

Method: 提出Generative Diffusion Retriever (GDR)，利用扩散模型生成查询，支持负提示和DDIM反转等生成工具。

Result: GDR在检索性能上优于对比学习模型，并支持非联合训练编码器的音频检索。

Conclusion: GDR为文本-音乐检索提供了新的可控性和交互性方向。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive models have achieved strong performance in text-audio
retrieval and zero-shot settings, but improving joint embedding spaces remains
an active research area. Less attention has been given to making these systems
controllable and interactive for users. In text-music retrieval, the ambiguity
of freeform language creates a many-to-many mapping, often resulting in
inflexible or unsatisfying results.
  We introduce Generative Diffusion Retriever (GDR), a novel framework that
leverages diffusion models to generate queries in a retrieval-optimized latent
space. This enables controllability through generative tools such as negative
prompting and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) inversion, opening a
new direction in retrieval control. GDR improves retrieval performance over
contrastive teacher models and supports retrieval in audio-only latent spaces
using non-jointly trained encoders. Finally, we demonstrate that GDR enables
effective post-hoc manipulation of retrieval behavior, enhancing interactive
control for text-music retrieval tasks.

Method: 基于统计方法，分析声音信号中与发声过程相关的独立可测量特征，量化这些变量的独特性。

Result: 研究表明，在100亿人口中，两人声音相同的概率从几千分之一到万亿分之一以下不等。

Conclusion: 声音具有高度的独特性，可作为可靠的生物识别标识，研究结果对声音处理应用的选择具有重要影响。

Abstract: Voice is increasingly being used as a biometric entity in many applications.
These range from speaker identification and verification systems to human
profiling technologies that attempt to estimate myriad aspects of the speaker's
persona from their voice. However, for an entity to be a true biometric
identifier, it must be unique. This paper establishes a first framework for
calculating the uniqueness of human voice objectively. The approach in this
paper is based on statistical considerations that take into account a set of
measurable characteristics of the voice signal that bear a causal relationship
to the vocal production process, but are not inter-dependent or derivable from
each other. Depending on how we quantize these variables, we show that the
chances of two people having the same voice in a world populated by 10 billion
people range from one in a few thousand, to one in a septillion or less. The
paper also discusses the implications of these calculations on the choices made
in voice processing applications.

Abstract: We construct Japanese Idol Speech Corpus (JIS) to advance research in speech
generation AI, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and voice conversion
(VC). JIS will facilitate more rigorous evaluations of speaker similarity in
TTS and VC systems since all speakers in JIS belong to a highly specific
category: "young female live idols" in Japan, and each speaker is identified by
a stage name, enabling researchers to recruit listeners familiar with these
idols for listening experiments. With its unique speaker attributes, JIS will
foster compelling research, including generating voices tailored to listener
preferences-an area not yet widely studied. JIS will be distributed free of
charge to promote research in speech generation AI, with usage restricted to
non-commercial, basic research. We describe the construction of JIS, provide an
overview of Japanese live idol culture to support effective and ethical use of
JIS, and offer a basic analysis to guide application of JIS.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分数聚合方法，通过建模评分者的连续评分过程，提升语音质量评估（SQA）模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统平均意见分数（MOS）的离散评分方式限制了模型的性能，需要更精确的评分表示方法。

Method: 假设评分者内部使用连续评分并选择最近的离散评分，通过量化潜在连续分布建模评分生成过程，并使用其峰值作为新的代表值。

Result: 实验表明，用提出的新值替代MOSNet的预测目标，提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过更精确的评分建模，有效提升了SQA模型的性能。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) aims to evaluate the quality of speech
samples without relying on time-consuming listener questionnaires. Recent
efforts have focused on training neural-based SQA models to predict the mean
opinion score (MOS) of speech samples produced by text-to-speech or voice
conversion systems. This paper targets the enhancement of MOS prediction
models' performance. We propose a novel score aggregation method to address the
limitations of conventional annotations for MOS, which typically involve
ratings on a scale from 1 to 5. Our method is based on the hypothesis that
annotators internally consider continuous scores and then choose the nearest
discrete rating. By modeling this process, we approximate the generative
distribution of ratings by quantizing the latent continuous distribution. We
then use the peak of this latent distribution, estimated through the loss
between the quantized distribution and annotated ratings, as a new
representative value instead of MOS. Experimental results demonstrate that
substituting MOSNet's predicted target with this proposed value improves
prediction performance.

Conclusion: 基于遗忘的归因方法在音乐生成模型中可行，有助于提升AI系统的伦理性和公平性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of unlearning methods for training data
attribution (TDA) in music generative models trained on large-scale datasets.
TDA aims to identify which specific training data points contributed to the
generation of a particular output from a specific model. This is crucial in the
context of AI-generated music, where proper recognition and credit for original
artists are generally overlooked. By enabling white-box attribution, our work
supports a fairer system for acknowledging artistic contributions and addresses
pressing concerns related to AI ethics and copyright. We apply unlearning-based
attribution to a text-to-music diffusion model trained on a large-scale dataset
and investigate its feasibility and behavior in this setting. To validate the
method, we perform a grid search over different hyperparameter configurations
and quantitatively evaluate the consistency of the unlearning approach. We then
compare attribution patterns from unlearning with those from a similarity-based
approach. Our findings suggest that unlearning-based approaches can be
effectively adapted to music generative models, introducing large-scale TDA to
this domain and paving the way for more ethical and accountable AI systems for
music creation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的语音质量评估方法N_low-MOS，通过关注低质量语音片段来提高评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在评估语音质量时可能更关注低质量片段，而传统MOS评分可能忽略了这一点。

Method: 分析了VCC2018和BVCC数据集，提出N_low-MOS（最低N个评分的均值）作为更可靠的评估指标。

Result: 实验显示，使用N_low-MOS训练的MOSNet在LCC和SRCC指标上优于传统MOS。

Conclusion: N_low-MOS能更准确地反映主观语音质量，提升语音转换模型的比较效果。

Abstract: The automatic speech quality assessment (SQA) has been extensively studied to
predict the speech quality without time-consuming questionnaires. Recently,
neural-based SQA models have been actively developed for speech samples
produced by text-to-speech or voice conversion, with a primary focus on
training mean opinion score (MOS) prediction models. The quality of each speech
sample may not be consistent across the entire duration, and it remains unclear
which segments of the speech receive the primary focus from humans when
assigning subjective evaluation for MOS calculation. We hypothesize that when
humans rate speech, they tend to assign more weight to low-quality speech
segments, and the variance in ratings for each sample is mainly due to
accidental assignment of higher scores when overlooking the poor quality speech
segments. Motivated by the hypothesis, we analyze the VCC2018 and BVCC
datasets. Based on the hypothesis, we propose the more reliable representative
value N_low-MOS, the mean of the $N$-lowest opinion scores. Our experiments
show that LCC and SRCC improve compared to regular MOS when employing N_low-MOS
to MOSNet training. This result suggests that N_low-MOS is a more intrinsic
representative value of subjective speech quality and makes MOSNet a better
comparator of VC models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成工具的兴起需要准确的检测方法，但现有音频检测器难以泛化且依赖完美歌词，实用性受限。

Method: 使用多种检测器，结合ASR模型（如Whisper large-v2）和LLM2Vec嵌入，转录歌曲并检测AI生成内容。

Result: 在多语言、多风格的歌词上表现出色，尤其在音频扰动和不同音乐生成器上优于现有音频检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了实际应用中的空白，提供了更鲁棒的AI音乐检测方案。

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

Motivation: 提高自动语音和语言处理系统的性能，推动更具包容性的语音和语言技术发展。

Method: 结合音频编码器的声学表征与不同质量的文本输入（如干净转录、时间对齐转录或ASR输出），利用LLM生成标注流畅性的转录。

Result: 实验表明，即使文本输入不完美，只要包含时间戳线索，LLM仍能生成完整的流畅性标注转录。

Conclusion: LLM在处理不完美提示时表现出鲁棒性，为流畅性标注转录提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

Result: TCDiff++在长时场景中表现优异，实现了高质量和连贯的群舞生成。

Conclusion: TCDiff++通过多种创新方法有效解决了群舞生成中的关键问题，性能达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its
wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group
choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing
methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer
foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this
paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to
generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer
collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the
relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a
distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within
plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we
introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design
a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For
long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling
strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional
information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder
layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and
coherent group dance generation.

Motivation: 传统评估方法忽略了音素类别和性别间的声学特征差异，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 女性语音在爆破音、摩擦音和元音中干扰减少更明显，且感知和语音识别指标更优。

Conclusion: 语音增强算法需考虑性别和音素差异，以优化性能。

Abstract: Multichannel speech enhancement algorithms are essential for improving the
intelligibility of speech signals in noisy environments. These algorithms are
usually evaluated at the utterance level, but this approach overlooks the
disparities in acoustic characteristics that are observed in different phoneme
categories and between male and female speakers. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of gender and phonetic content on speech enhancement algorithms. We
motivate this approach by outlining phoneme- and gender-specific spectral
features. Our experiments reveal that while utterance-level differences between
genders are minimal, significant variations emerge at the phoneme level.
Results show that the tested algorithms better reduce interference with fewer
artifacts on female speech, particularly in plosives, fricatives, and vowels.
Additionally, they demonstrate greater performance for female speech in terms
of perceptual and speech recognition metrics.

Motivation: 传统SDR损失函数可能无法保留对音素可懂性至关重要的频谱细节，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了频域加权的SDR损失函数变体，包括固定和自适应策略，如ANSI频带重要性加权和动态加权。

Result: 实验表明，感知加权指标显著提升，频谱和音素分析显示辅音重建更好。

Conclusion: 频域加权策略能更好地保留声学线索，提升语音增强效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved multichannel
speech enhancement algorithms, yet conventional training loss functions such as
the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) may fail to preserve
fine-grained spectral cues essential for phoneme intelligibility. In this work,
we propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the
time-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.
These weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is
prominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate
both fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,
spectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative
amount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement
model using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard
metrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual
frequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.
Besides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant
reconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues.

Abstract: We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune
text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various
time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is
that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music
generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the
condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an
example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings
to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%
to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical
attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating
improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet
at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

Conclusion: 群体智慧中个体通过博弈论优化可实现更准确的估计，但需避免少数影响者的主导。

Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the
collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the
individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example
illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by
Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an
ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This
phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on
independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be
significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few
influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess
uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.
Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple
non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the
French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this
iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic
estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate
determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every
agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state
of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights
allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents
must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined
by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto
frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we
examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove
their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.

Motivation: 双人舞蹈生成的关键挑战在于舞伴之间以及与音乐的同步和交互复杂性。

Result: DuetGen在动作真实性、音乐舞蹈对齐和舞伴协调方面表现出色。

Conclusion: DuetGen通过分层掩码建模和专用交互表示，实现了跨流派的双人舞蹈生成，性能领先。

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person
dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent
complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to
synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent
advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding
two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from
music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both
dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and
adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage
utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at
a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,
producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.
Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to
map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level
semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic
tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to
predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to

Motivation: 解决复杂场景编辑任务中对象、相机和背景的灵活控制问题。

Method: 采用分层-编辑-合成流程，结合预训练的扩散模型和关键训练策略。

Result: 在复杂场景编辑任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BlenderFusion为场景编辑提供了高效且灵活的工具。

Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that
synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It
follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting
visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in
Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original
(source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video
frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible
modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing
tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大规模场景重建的挑战，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances
in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes
remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic
appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the
application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a
novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details,
supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene
partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we
integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations
and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects.
Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view
regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the
publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned
aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing
NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results
and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will
be available on GitHub.

Method: 通过采样点云编码形状条件，并使用GPT风格变换器依次预测带有量化3D坐标的切割缝段。

Conclusion: SeamGPT在表面切割任务中表现出色，能够生成语义连贯的切割缝，提升了现有工具的性能。

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用GPU波通信内在特性改进纹理压缩和过滤的新算法，减少了重复纹理解压，提高了放大过滤质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机纹理过滤（STF）技术在放大时可能导致视觉外观变化、噪声和闪烁，需要改进。

Method: 利用GPU波通信内在特性，在活动着色器内共享解码纹理值，避免重复纹理解压，并提出新的过滤回退方法。

Result: 在足够大的放大因子下，实现了零误差过滤（每像素≤1次纹理评估），其他情况下过滤质量也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提高了纹理过滤质量，减少了计算开销。

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in
compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression
and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering
(STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such
formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance
changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite
the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the
quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values
between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,
this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory
traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that
use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression
prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve
zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently
large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering
fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

TL;DR: Morse提出了一种无损加速扩散模型的双采样框架，通过快速跳跃采样和自适应残差反馈策略提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成过程通常较慢，Morse旨在无损加速这一过程，同时保持生成质量。

Method: Morse包含Dash和Dot两个模型：Dash为预训练扩散模型，采用跳跃采样；Dot生成残差反馈，提升噪声估计效率。两者通过时间交错运行实现高效生成。

Result: 在6个图像生成任务中，Morse实现了1.78X到3.31X的无损加速，优于9个基线扩散模型。

Conclusion: Morse不仅高效，还可推广到其他加速模型（如LCM-SDXL），适用于少步文本到图像合成。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

Motivation: 设计有效的传递函数（TFs）在直接体积渲染（DVR）中至关重要，但现有方法存在探索空间大和泛化能力弱的问题。

Method: 提出WYTWYG框架，包含基于进化的探索器和基于MLLMs的渲染质量评估器，并开发了交互式TF设计系统。

Result: 通过三个案例研究和大量实验验证了框架的通用性和各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: WYTWYG框架成功解决了TF优化中的挑战，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing
volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in
extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains
unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.
Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.
However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space
and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think
is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,
we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core
components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF
space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide
generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design
system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our
framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each
component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: BulletGen通过生成内容与静态/动态场景的无缝融合，显著提升了动态场景重建的质量。

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic
experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges,
e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共识控制器在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，需一种轻量级、去中心化的解决方案来增强MAS的韧性。

Method: 提出Second-Order State Hallucination（SOSH），利用二阶泰勒展开进行状态预测和修正，实现快速恢复。

Result: SOSH在5智能体实验中表现优于现有方案，收敛更快、稳态误差更低，且具有理论稳定性保证。

Conclusion: SOSH为MAS对抗复杂攻击提供了理论支持与实践可行性，是未来研究的有力方向。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of multi-agent systems (MAS) in critical
infrastructures such as autonomous transportation, disaster relief, and smart
cities demands robust formation control mechanisms resilient to adversarial
attacks. Traditional consensus-based controllers, while effective under nominal
conditions, are highly vulnerable to data manipulation, sensor spoofing, and
communication failures. To address this challenge, we propose Second-Order
State Hallucination (SOSH), a novel framework that detects compromised agents
through distributed residual monitoring and maintains formation stability by
replacing attacked states with predictive second-order approximations. Unlike
existing mitigation strategies that require significant restructuring or induce
long transients, SOSH offers a lightweight, decentralized correction mechanism
based on second-order Taylor expansions, enabling rapid and scalable
resilience. We establish rigorous Lyapunov-based stability guarantees, proving
that formation errors remain exponentially bounded even under persistent
attacks, provided the hallucination parameters satisfy explicit conditions.
Comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments on a 5-agent complete graph formation
demonstrate that SOSH outperforms established robust control schemes, including
W-MSR and Huber-based consensus filters, achieving faster convergence rates,
lower steady-state error, and superior transient recovery. Our results confirm
that SOSH combines theoretical robustness with practical deployability,
offering a promising direction for securing MAS formations against
sophisticated adversarial threats.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of neural simulation gap functions,
which formally quantifies the gap between the mathematical model and the model
in the high-fidelity simulator, which closely resembles reality. Many times, a
controller designed for a mathematical model does not work in reality because
of the unmodelled gap between the two systems. With the help of this simulation
gap function, one can use existing model-based tools to design controllers for
the mathematical system and formally guarantee a decent transition from the
simulation to the real world. Although in this work, we have quantified this
gap using a neural network, which is trained using a finite number of data
points, we give formal guarantees on the simulation gap function for the entire
state space including the unseen data points. We collect data from
high-fidelity simulators leveraging recent advancements in Real-to-Sim transfer
to ensure close alignment with reality. We demonstrate our results through two
case studies - a Mecanum bot and a Pendulum.

Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the
current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety,
reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently
inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge
real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making,
and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is
designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor,
utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance
policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework
integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference
to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and
self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health
and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints
enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance
with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit
from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with
Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a
one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning
capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements,
and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration
capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate
robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation,
with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex
engineering systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that
use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state
estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield
construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors
by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision
process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal
prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each
observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a
user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed
for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety
guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing
shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of
reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the
shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental
autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional
perception DNNs.

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale

power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale

comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants
(VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical
control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24

  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to

traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources
with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when
confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000

  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces

new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating
that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale
pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that
workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service

Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical
processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of
computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models,
which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived
via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as
a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of
dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate
data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an
incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples
the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and
conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1)
regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for
flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between
variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning
techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and
data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model
structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows
for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies
are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our
incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited
data.

Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a
result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous
generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the
microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual
synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic
behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,
fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency
regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic
adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable
frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and
droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This
controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by
considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study
the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real
time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,
Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the
frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery
time.

Result: 定义了SAL的语法和语义，引入公理并证明其完备性和可靠性。

Abstract: This article develops a novel framework for modal logic based on the idea of
stratified actualization, rather than the classical model of global possible
worlds. Traditional Kripke semantics treat modal operators as quantification
over fully determinate alternatives, neglecting the local, dynamic, and often
asymmetric nature of actualization processes. We propose a system Stratified
Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of
ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality
operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal
coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and
semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness.
Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum
decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures
the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract
possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.

### [552] [Resolving the Ti-V Phase Diagram Discrepancy with First-Principles Calculations and Bayesian Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17719)
*Timofei Miryashkin,Olga Klimanova,Alexander Shapeev*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 研究通过结合第一性原理和机器学习方法，确认钛钒（Ti-V）二元合金存在体心立方（BCC）混溶间隙，且该现象与氧污染无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于Ti-V二元合金是否具有BCC混溶间隙或完全可溶的实验争议，验证氧污染是否为混溶间隙的原因。

Method: 采用第一性原理+机器学习的工作流程，结合主动训练的矩张量势和贝叶斯热力学推断，模拟Ti-V二元系统。

Result: 模拟结果支持存在BCC混溶间隙，终止温度为980 K，钒浓度为0.67，且排除了氧污染的影响。

Conclusion: 研究证实Ti-V二元合金的BCC混溶间隙是固有特性，与氧污染无关，反驳了CALPHAD的重新评估结果。

Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V)
binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains
completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to
oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we
use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained
Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this
workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range,
together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting
diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of
our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap
terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from
simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting
recent CALPHAD reassessments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差连接增强的ConvLSTM模型，用于更准确地预测锂枝晶生长模式，提升电池性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂枝晶生长严重影响可充电电池的性能和安全性，导致短路和容量下降。

Method: 通过将残差连接集成到ConvLSTM中，解决了梯度消失问题，增强了特征保留能力，同时捕捉局部枝晶生长动态和宏观电池行为。

Result: 实验结果显示，该模型在不同电压条件下（0.1V、0.3V、0.5V）比传统ConvLSTM准确率提高7%，均方误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 残差连接在电化学系统建模中表现出色，为电池诊断提供了强大工具，未来可扩展至其他电池化学体系并与实验数据结合验证。

Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and
safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity
degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model
to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational
efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model
mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across
layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and
macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field
model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental
results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and
significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional
ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This
highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal
networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a
robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring
and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend
this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world
experimental data for further validation

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的框架CLOUD，用于预测晶体性质，通过结合对称性一致的表示和物理原理，实现了高效且可解释的材料建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如实验或DFT计算）资源密集且难以扩展，而现有机器学习模型缺乏对结构特征的充分捕捉和物理原理的整合，限制了其通用性和可解释性。

Method: CLOUD采用了一种新颖的对称性一致有序参数编码（SCOPE），将晶体对称性、Wyckoff位置和组成编码为紧凑的字符串表示，并通过预训练和微调实现多任务预测。

Result: CLOUD在多种材料性质预测任务中表现优异，并展示了强扩展性。CLOUD-DEBYE框架进一步实现了热力学一致的温度依赖性预测。

Conclusion: CLOUD作为一种可扩展且物理信息化的基础模型，为晶体材料的性质预测和发现提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding
structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional
materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental
measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often
resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models
offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property
relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models
often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential
structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical
principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability.
Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable
materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel
Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal
symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free
string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures,
CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive
performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating
strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable
materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and
heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic
consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and
enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional
data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and
physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying
symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for
property prediction and materials discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NIP在预测电子属性和宏观性质时的局限性，以及传统ML方法在通用性和计算资源需求上的权衡。

Method: 提出HackNIP，通过预训练NIP提取特征向量，再用浅层ML模型进行结构到属性的映射。

Result: 在Matbench上验证了HackNIP的数据效率和性能，分析了嵌入深度对性能的影响。

Conclusion: HackNIP通过混合策略克服了ML在材料科学中的权衡，有望推动高性能预测建模的普及。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic
potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated
significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic
simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties
and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for
macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for
structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often
lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and
computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a
two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts
fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then
uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream
structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a
hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep
neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning
approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP
embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on
Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including
\textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how
embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization
strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize
high-performance predictive modeling.

Motivation: 解决现有神经影像基础模型体积庞大、数据需求高的问题，提供更高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: BrainSymphony证明轻量级多模态模型可超越大型模型，推动计算神经科学研究。

Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and
data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient
foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being
pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong
multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial
and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a
unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models
structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph
transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful,
modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion
gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger
models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification,
prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our
model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a
unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration).
BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can
surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and
powerful research in computational neuroscience.

Motivation: 确保大型语言模型符合数据与AI法规，保护用户隐私，减少偏见和错误信息，但现有知识删除方法存在隐藏知识可被恢复的问题。

Method: 提出Sleek攻击方法，包括对抗性提示生成、攻击机制和提示分类，通过逐步推理暴露知识删除的弱点。

Result: 实验显示，现有方法无法可靠删除知识，62.5%的攻击提示成功恢复了被删除的《哈利波特》知识，50%暴露了知识的不公平抑制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了知识删除技术的信息泄露风险，强调了需要更鲁棒的删除策略。

Abstract: Knowledge erasure in large language models (LLMs) is important for ensuring
compliance with data and AI regulations, safeguarding user privacy, mitigating
bias, and misinformation. Existing unlearning methods aim to make the process
of knowledge erasure more efficient and effective by removing specific
knowledge while preserving overall model performance, especially for retained
information. However, it has been observed that the unlearning techniques tend
to suppress and leave the knowledge beneath the surface, thus making it
retrievable with the right prompts. In this work, we demonstrate that
\textit{step-by-step reasoning} can serve as a backdoor to recover this hidden
information. We introduce a step-by-step reasoning-based black-box attack,
Sleek, that systematically exposes unlearning failures. We employ a structured
attack framework with three core components: (1) an adversarial prompt
generation strategy leveraging step-by-step reasoning built from LLM-generated
queries, (2) an attack mechanism that successfully recalls erased content, and
exposes unfair suppression of knowledge intended for retention and (3) a
categorization of prompts as direct, indirect, and implied, to identify which
query types most effectively exploit unlearning weaknesses. Through extensive
evaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used
LLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge
removal. Of the generated adversarial prompts, 62.5% successfully retrieved
forgotten Harry Potter facts from WHP-unlearned Llama, while 50% exposed unfair
suppression of retained knowledge. Our work highlights the persistent risks of
information leakage, emphasizing the need for more robust unlearning strategies
for erasure.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦学习通过协调服务器实现客户端协作学习，避免直接数据共享以保护隐私。然而，成员推理攻击（MIAs）研究表明，未受保护的数据仍面临高成功率攻击。尽管本地差分隐私（LDP）被视为隐私保护的金标准，但多数MIAs研究忽视LDP或未提供理论保证。本文推导了针对LDP保护数据的低多项式时间MIAs的理论下限，证明隐私风险仍存在。实验证实，缓解攻击所需的噪声会显著降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽被视为隐私保护解决方案，但成员推理攻击（MIAs）对其有效性提出挑战。现有研究多忽视LDP保护下的攻击风险，缺乏理论支持。

Method: 推导低多项式时间MIAs的理论下限，分析其在全连接或自注意力层中的漏洞。通过实验评估联邦视觉模型中的隐私风险。

Result: 即使数据受LDP保护，隐私风险仍存在，且缓解攻击所需的噪声会显著降低模型性能。

Conclusion: LDP保护下的联邦学习仍面临隐私风险，需权衡隐私预算与模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a
coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived
solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference
Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against
unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely
regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most
studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees
for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we
derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time
MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers.
We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist,
depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision
models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to
mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在安全关键应用中的部署增加，缺乏系统性方法评估其对越狱攻击的脆弱性成为一个关键安全漏洞。

Method: Boa算法采用三阶段搜索策略：构建拒绝模式的黑名单、广度优先采样识别易访问的越狱路径、深度优先优先级搜索探索低概率路径。

Result: Boa能够高效解决越狱预言问题，支持系统性防御评估、标准化红队攻击比较及极端对抗条件下的模型认证。

Conclusion: Boa为LLMs的安全评估提供了首个高效解决方案，填补了系统性越狱漏洞评估的空白。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in
safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their
vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We
introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding
strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with
likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a
principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle
problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows
exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first
efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a
three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal
patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks,
and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to
systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous
security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized
comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme
adversarial conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“计划注入”的新型上下文操纵攻击，针对自主网络导航代理的漏洞，展示了其攻击效果显著高于传统提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自主网络导航代理依赖外部内存系统维护上下文，而客户端或第三方应用管理的内存存在安全漏洞，近期被用于攻击生产系统，因此研究此类攻击的潜在威胁至关重要。

Method: 通过系统评估两种流行的网络代理（Browser-use和Agent-E），引入并形式化了“计划注入”攻击，并设计了“上下文链式注入”以提升攻击成功率。

Result: 计划注入攻击绕过现有防御机制，攻击成功率比传统提示注入高3倍；上下文链式注入在隐私泄露任务中成功率提升17.7%。

Conclusion: 研究强调，安全内存处理必须是代理系统的首要关注点。

Abstract: Autonomous web navigation agents, which translate natural language
instructions into sequences of browser actions, are increasingly deployed for
complex tasks across e-commerce, information retrieval, and content discovery.
Due to the stateless nature of large language models (LLMs), these agents rely
heavily on external memory systems to maintain context across interactions.
Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent
memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating
significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack
production systems.
  We introduce and formalize "plan injection," a novel context manipulation
attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting
this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web
agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust
prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than
comparable prompt-based attacks. Furthermore, "context-chained injections,"
which craft logical bridges between legitimate user goals and attacker
objectives, lead to a 17.7% increase in success rate for privacy exfiltration
tasks. Our findings highlight that secure memory handling must be a first-class
concern in agentic systems.

Abstract: Healthcare 5.0 integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of

personalized medicine and predictive diagnostics. However, the increasing
reliance on interconnected medical technologies exposes them to cyber threats.
Meanwhile, current AI-driven cybersecurity models often neglect biomedical

this gap by applying eXplainable AI (XAI) to a Healthcare 5.0 dataset that
integrates network traffic and biomedical sensor data. Classification outputs
indicate that XGBoost achieved 99% F1-score for benign and data alteration, and
81% for spoofing. Explainability findings reveal that network data play a
dominant role in intrusion detection whereas biomedical features contributed to
spoofing detection, with temperature reaching a Shapley values magnitude of

Motivation: 现有后门攻击多为目标攻击，而无目标攻击效果较弱。CUBA旨在结合两者的优势，提升攻击的隐蔽性和有效性。

Method: 通过应用对数归一化的交叉熵损失和翻转的独热标签，约束训练过程中的对数，使模型在选定目标类别上呈现均匀分布。

Result: 实验证明CUBA在不同数据集上均有效，能够绕过现有防御方法。

Conclusion: CUBA为后门攻击提供了一种新的灵活且隐蔽的方式，对现有防御方法提出了挑战。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks have emerged as a critical security threat against deep
neural networks in recent years. The majority of existing backdoor attacks
focus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to
specific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this
inherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating
such targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor
scenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what
makes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel
Constrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility
of untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The
compromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into
random classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the
attacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the
proposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor
defense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled
flexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with
flipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the
compromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target
classes, resulting in controlled untargeted attack. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUBA on different datasets.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调LLMs中的数据泄露风险，为开发更安全模型提供了见解。

Abstract: The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response
pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper
studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally
defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types,
and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world
scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction,
we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models,
called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence
levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained
base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and
scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our
results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in
all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism
that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall,
our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides
insights for developing more secure models.

TL;DR: Weaver框架通过结合多个弱验证器，显著提升了语言模型在生成候选响应时的选择性能，减少了标注数据依赖，并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量验证器（如人类）难以扩展，而通用验证器（如LM评估模型）与理想验证器存在性能差距。Weaver旨在通过结合多个弱验证器来缩小这一差距。

Method: Weaver利用弱监督估计验证器准确性，并通过数据集统计标准化输出和过滤低质量验证器，设计加权验证器组合。

Result: Weaver在推理和数学任务中显著提升了Pass@1性能，达到接近理想验证器的准确性（87.7%），同时通过训练小型交叉编码器降低计算成本。

Conclusion: Weaver通过结合弱验证器和弱监督方法，有效提升了验证器性能，为语言模型的高效验证提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking
responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are
either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).
While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose
verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle
verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we
introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining
multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,
which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform
unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce
dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each
verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better
reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision
algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and
handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics
to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's
effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple
candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly
improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across
reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward
models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o
and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and
post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a

Abstract: Malware detection using machine learning requires feature extraction from
binary files, as models cannot process raw binaries directly. A common approach
involves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to
generate 2381-dimensional feature vectors. However, the high dimensionality of
these features introduces significant computational challenges. This study
addresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques:
XGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We
evaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond
to approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across
four models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified
training, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and
BODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias.
Experimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature
set after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on
the unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational
efficiency and detection performance. The best model, trained in 61 minutes
using 30 GB of RAM and 19.5 GB of disk space, generalizes effectively to
completely unseen datasets, maintaining 95.31% accuracy on TRITIUM and 93.98%
accuracy on INFERNO. These findings present a scalable, compute-efficient
approach for malware detection without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: 架构混淆既能保持全局模型行为，又能阻碍用户特定内容的机制分析，为隐私防御和可解释性工具提供指导。

Abstract: Architectural obfuscation - e.g., permuting hidden-state tensors, linearly
transforming embedding tables, or remapping tokens - has recently gained
traction as a lightweight substitute for heavyweight cryptography in
privacy-preserving large-language-model (LLM) inference. While recent work has
shown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction
attacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been
systematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a
network's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the
model works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate
system. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from
scratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is
private and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious
server), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and
attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings
reveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within
attention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This
disconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose
their alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions
become too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual
pathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades
fine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.
These results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation
can simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede
mechanistic analyses of user-specific content. By mapping where
interpretability breaks down, our study provides guidance for future privacy
defences and for robustness-aware interpretability tooling.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across
clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale,
privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous
framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local
differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To
preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally
adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising
tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first
practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms
using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their
successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the
underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces
Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items
with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdRo-FL提出了一种对抗性鲁棒的联邦学习方法，既能基于客户端效用进行智能选择，又能防御偏置选择攻击，同时保持隐私保护聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的安全聚合（SA）存在偏置选择攻击（BSA）漏洞，而随机选择方法虽能防止BSA，却无法实现智能客户端选择，影响性能。

Method: AdRo-FL设计了两种客户端选择框架：一种是基于集群信任的，通过配额和效用函数防御BSA；另一种是分布式无信任环境下的两阶段选择协议（效用排名+VRF）。

Result: AdRo-FL在时间效率和最终准确率上分别达到基线方法的1.85倍和1.06倍。

Conclusion: AdRo-FL在保持隐私保护的同时，实现了高效且鲁棒的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing
clients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,
studies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these
updates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during
transmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where
adversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,
constituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random
selection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL
performance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which
simultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and
robust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL
implements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The
first framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual
trust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework
handles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.
For the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)
enforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a
cluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to
prioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a
two-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients
based on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)
ensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to
reduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve
energy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\times$ faster time-to-accuracy
and up to $1.06\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.

Abstract: With the widespread application of edge computing and cloud systems in
AI-driven applications, how to maintain efficient performance while ensuring
data privacy has become an urgent security issue. This paper proposes a
federated learning-based data collaboration method to improve the security of
edge cloud AI systems, and use large-scale language models (LLMs) to enhance
data privacy protection and system robustness. Based on the existing federated
learning framework, this method introduces a secure multi-party computation
protocol, which optimizes the data aggregation and encryption process between
distributed nodes by using LLM to ensure data privacy and improve system
efficiency. By combining advanced adversarial training techniques, the model
enhances the resistance of edge cloud AI systems to security threats such as
data leakage and model poisoning. Experimental results show that the proposed
method is 15% better than the traditional federated learning method in terms of
data protection and model robustness.

Motivation: 物联网（IoT）的快速发展带来了安全挑战，传统入侵检测系统（IDS）忽视网络流量的时间特性，限制了早期威胁检测的效果。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合动态时间位置编码和数据增强技术，捕捉网络流量的时序异常。

Result: 在CICIoT2023数据集上表现优于现有模型，同时在资源受限的IoT设备上实现了低延迟和低内存占用。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced
significant security challenges, necessitating efficient and adaptive Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS). Traditional IDS models often overlook the temporal
characteristics of network traffic, limiting their effectiveness in early
threat detection. We propose a Transformer-based Early Intrusion Detection
System (EIDS) that incorporates dynamic temporal positional encodings to
enhance detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. By
leveraging network flow timestamps, our approach captures both sequence
structure and timing irregularities indicative of malicious behaviour.
Additionally, we introduce a data augmentation pipeline to improve model
robustness. Evaluated on the CICIoT2023 dataset, our method outperforms
existing models in both accuracy and earliness. We further demonstrate its
real-time feasibility on resource-constrained IoT devices, achieving
low-latency inference and minimal memory footprint.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能合约漏洞检测方法存在数据集不全面和大型语言模型（LLMs）解释不准确的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 构建全面数据集，结合持续预训练（CPT）、监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO），提升模型性能。

Result: 在四种主要漏洞类型上，F1分数和准确率分别平均提升10.43%和7.87%，解释质量显著提高。

Conclusion: Smart-LLaMA-DPO方法在智能合约漏洞检测和解释生成方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerability detection remains a major challenge in
blockchain security. Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main
issues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality
explanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often
struggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract
security. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)
and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of
state changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct
detection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO
based on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major
vulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise
labels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and
low-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we
perform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding
of specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT
with our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human
feedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability
of preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred
outputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:
reentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,
as well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in
F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human
evaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear
explanations.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了DeepSeek系列模型在对抗性攻击（如越狱攻击）下的鲁棒性，并与GPT-3.5和GPT-4进行了对比。研究发现，DeepSeek的MoE架构在优化攻击下表现较好，但在提示攻击下更脆弱，而GPT-4 Turbo整体安全性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源大语言模型（如DeepSeek）的广泛应用，其对抗攻击的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，而专有模型（如GPT-4）已得到广泛评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用HarmBench基准对DeepSeek系列模型、GPT-3.5和GPT-4进行了系统评估，涵盖7种攻击策略和510种有害行为。

Result: DeepSeek的MoE架构在优化攻击（如TAP-T）下表现较好，但在提示攻击下更脆弱；GPT-4 Turbo因密集Transformer设计和人类反馈强化学习而表现更一致。

Conclusion: 开源模型在架构效率与对齐泛化之间存在权衡，需针对性安全调优和模块化对齐策略以确保安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical
concerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial
prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating
outputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive
evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as
DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in
real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic
jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack
strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and
semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness
against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly
higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In
contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety
alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design
and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral
analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial
prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal
behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between
architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for
targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure
deployment of open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has
completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study
including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover
exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical
characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset
consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will
examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness
due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived
from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to
derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit,
such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period
will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent
timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The
density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as
well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of
the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase
curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some
machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or
likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil
both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing
important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of
searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.

Abstract: We study an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time
stochastic processes with independent increments. At each stage, a fixed number
of processes are retained based on their observed values. Under this simple
model, we prove that the optimal strategy for selecting the final maximum-value
process is to apply greedy selection at each stage. While the result relies on
strong independence assumptions, it offers a clean justification for greedy
heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and may serve as a toy example
for understanding related algorithms in high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with
missing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is
close to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy
additional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a
bounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including
machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad
real-world applications.
  This paper presents new $\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix
completion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and
any real number $\varepsilon \in [ 2^{-O(d)},\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial
matrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive
semi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a
positive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an
additive error of at most $\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to
exceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2 \cdot
\log(1/\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,
and Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than
$2$ and to $\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is
constrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive
semi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity
assumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel
notion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line
digraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.

Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt
on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while
powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud
connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic
alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained
learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and
unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power
edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or
datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work
presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+
SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and
inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated
on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to
17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing
accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices,
bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital for
navigating the ever-expanding body of scientific literature, particularly in
high-stakes domains such as chemistry. Despite the promise of RAG, foundational
design choices -- such as how documents are segmented and represented -- remain
underexplored in domain-specific contexts. This study presents the first
large-scale, systematic evaluation of chunking strategies and embedding models
tailored to chemistry-focused RAG systems. We investigate 25 chunking
configurations across five method families and evaluate 48 embedding models on
three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the newly introduced
QuestChemRetrieval dataset. Our results reveal that recursive token-based
chunking (specifically R100-0) consistently outperforms other approaches,
offering strong performance with minimal resource overhead. We also find that
retrieval-optimized embeddings -- such as Nomic and Intfloat E5 variants --
substantially outperform domain-specialized models like SciBERT. By releasing
our datasets, evaluation framework, and empirical benchmarks, we provide
actionable guidelines for building effective and efficient chemistry-aware RAG
systems.

Conclusion: CORONA通过结合LLMs和GNNs的优势，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user
might be interested in from a large pool. A common approach is using graph
neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As
large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across domains,
researchers are exploring their use to enhance recommendation. However, prior
work limits LLMs to re-ranking results or dataset augmentation, failing to
utilize their power during candidate filtering - which may lead to suboptimal
performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities during
the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs
(CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on
interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference
reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to
extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as
preference-assisted retrieval; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the
previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts
intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as
intent-assisted retrieval; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order
collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing
GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The
proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the
retrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall
recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
settings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative
improvement in NDCG on average.

*Jiale Zhang,Jiaxiang Chen,Zhucong Li,Jie Ding,Kui Zhao,Zenglin Xu,Xin Pang,Yinghui Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SlimRAG是一个轻量级的检索增强生成框架，通过实体感知机制替代复杂的图结构，提高了检索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于图的RAG系统中存在的结构开销大和检索不精确的问题。

Method: 使用实体感知机制构建紧凑的实体到块表，查询时通过识别关键实体并检索相关块，避免图遍历。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试中，SlimRAG在准确性和检索效率上优于基于图和扁平化的基线方法。

Conclusion: SlimRAG证明了无结构的、以实体为中心的检索方法在效率和准确性上的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by
incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, graph-based RAG
systems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they
require costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet
frequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.
This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply
semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval
without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet
effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact
entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it
identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and
assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or
edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index
Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved
content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG
outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing
index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of
structure-free, entity-centric context selection. The code will be released
soon. https://github.com/continue-ai-company/SlimRAG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）改进COVID-19相关文献检索系统的方法，以提取未标注文献中的隐藏关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19疫情期间文献数量庞大，需要高效检索系统以应对突发疫情。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLMs）提取未标注文献中的隐藏关系，改进Covrelex-SE检索系统。

Result: 系统在检索过程中能提供更多有用信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了检索系统在突发疫情中的信息检索效率。

Abstract: In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous
publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive
volume of publications, an efficient retrieval system is necessary to provide
researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so
suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the
retrieval system, the Covrelex-SE system, to provide more high-quality search
results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract
the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found
by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the
system to have more useful information during retrieval progress.

accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on
the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的快速增长使知识提取和合成变得困难，传统搜索引擎和通用LLM无法提供深度且最新的答案。

Method: WISE采用基于树的LLM架构，动态评分和排名，自适应停止标准，提取查询对齐、上下文感知且非冗余的信息。

Result: 实验显示WISE减少80%以上处理文本，召回率显著高于基线，输出更具独特性和深度。

Conclusion: WISE可适应多领域，高效提取和合成非结构化科学文献和网络资源中的知识。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers
extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many
sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer
concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search
capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete
answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific
Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured
workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an
LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned,
context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking
prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping
criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized
answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse
sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces
processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over
baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU
metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel
level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore
how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery,
material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction
and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，通过多场景建模用户兴趣演化，提升推荐系统的多场景推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中，用户在不同场景下的兴趣可能不一致，增加了统一建模的难度。

Method: 采用Double Q-learning增强下一项预测准确性，并利用Q值优化对比学习损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多场景推荐任务中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 为多场景建模提供了新视角，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In real-world recommendation systems, users would engage in variety
scenarios, such as homepages, search pages, and related recommendation pages.
Each of these scenarios would reflect different aspects users focus on.
However, the user interests may be inconsistent in different scenarios, due to
differences in decision-making processes and preference expression. This
variability complicates unified modeling, making multi-scenario learning a
significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning approach that models user preferences across scenarios by modeling
user interest evolution across multiple scenarios. Our method employs Double
Q-learning to enhance next-item prediction accuracy and optimizes contrastive
learning loss using Q-value to make model performance better. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
multi-scenario recommendation tasks. Our work offers a fresh perspective on
multi-scenario modeling and highlights promising directions for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推荐系统中的文本摘要需要高度相关且符合字数限制，现有大型语言模型方法不直接适用。

Method: CARTS采用多代理框架，分为生成增强生成（GAG）、精炼循环和仲裁三个阶段，逐步提取特征、优化标题并选择最终结果。

Result: 实验表明，CARTS在标题相关性和用户参与度上显著优于单次和链式思维LLM基线。

Conclusion: CARTS为推荐系统中的文本摘要提供了高效解决方案，通过多代理协作显著提升效果。

Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data
summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product
carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have
shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not
directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly
relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit
constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for
Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for
structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task
into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and
arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting
salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance
and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative
arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B
testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and
chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved
user engagement metrics.

*Catarina Pires,Sérgio Nunes,Luís Filipe Teixeira*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）扩展信息检索（IR）系统中的相关性标注，以减少对人工标注的依赖，并在医学案例检索任务中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的人工相关性标注（qrels）成本高且耗时，而现有的池化方法仅能生成部分标注数据集。多模态大语言模型（MLLM）为解决这一问题提供了新思路，尤其是在需要分析文本和视觉信息的复杂领域（如医学案例检索）中。

Method: 研究采用Gemini 1.5 Pro模型，通过迭代优化的结构化提示策略（包括二元评分、基于指令的评估和少样本学习），在ImageCLEFmed 2013任务中模拟人工标注，生成自动化相关性标注。

Result: MLLM与人工标注的Cohen's Kappa一致性得分为0.6，与多模态检索任务中常见的标注者间一致性相当。数据集从15,028条人工标注扩展到558,653条，相关标注从4.72%增加到5,950条。

Conclusion: MLLM能够显著扩展相关性标注的规模，为医学和多模态IR任务中的检索评估提供了新的支持方向。

Abstract: Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems relies on high-quality manual
relevance judgments (qrels), which are costly and time-consuming to obtain.
While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially
labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to
reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like
medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing
both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating
a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on
the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment
through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates
binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We
systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize
agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and
human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score
of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in
multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments
(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset
by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On
average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with
approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in
this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance
judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval
evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统缺乏即时需求交互和CRS缺乏协同信号的问题，实现更丰富的个性化推荐。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：时间分析、语义对话规划和多轮模拟，生成基于用户历史的多轮对话。

Result: 生成12K多轮对话，模型在Hit@K和NDCG@K上优于基线，Yelp上Hit@1提升10.9%。

Conclusion: ConvRecStudio有效结合用户历史和对话上下文，显著提升推荐效果。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems typically follow two complementary paradigms:
collaborative filtering, which models long-term user preferences from
historical interactions, and conversational recommendation systems (CRS), which
interact with users in natural language to uncover immediate needs. Each
captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack
collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions,
traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate
needs. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains
challenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in
real user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large
language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in
timestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a
three-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles
and community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)
Semantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of
flexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the
plan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by
executional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three
domains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K
multi-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the
naturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated
conversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer
model that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in
Hit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion.
Notably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the
strongest baseline.

Abstract: Life sciences research increasingly requires identifying, accessing, and
effectively processing data from an ever-evolving array of information sources
on the Linked Open Data (LOD) network. This dynamic landscape places a
significant burden on researchers, as the quality of query responses depends
heavily on the selection and semantic integration of data sources --processes
that are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly. While the adoption of
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles has
aimed to address these challenges, barriers to efficient and accurate
scientific data processing persist.
  In this paper, we introduce FAIRBridge, an experimental natural
language-based query processing system designed to empower scientists to
discover, access, and query biological databases, even when they are not
FAIR-compliant. FAIRBridge harnesses the capabilities of AI to interpret query
intents, map them to relevant databases described in scientific literature, and
generate executable queries via intelligent resource access plans. The system
also includes robust tools for mitigating low-quality query processing,
ensuring high fidelity and responsiveness in the information delivered.
  FAIRBridge's autonomous query processing framework enables users to explore
alternative data sources, make informed choices at every step, and leverage
community-driven crowd curation when needed. By providing a user-friendly,
automated hypothesis-testing platform in natural English, FAIRBridge
significantly enhances the integration and processing of scientific data,
offering researchers a powerful new tool for advancing their inquiries.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by
leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on
modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence
item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain
Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that
enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and
significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual
and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text
embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A
multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain
preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests
across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling
cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of
multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential
recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.

Motivation: 随着在线平台业务规模和范围的扩大，多场景匹配成为降低维护成本和缓解数据稀疏的主流解决方案，但现有方法常忽略用户特定建模。

Method: PERSCEN构建用户特定特征图，利用轻量级图神经网络捕获高阶交互模式，并通过向量量化技术提取场景感知偏好，结合渐进式场景感知门控线性单元实现信息融合。

Conclusion: PERSCEN通过用户特定和场景感知建模，显著提升多场景推荐效果，适用于实际工业系统。

Abstract: With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms,
multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance
costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario
recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all
scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,
existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation
of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an
innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into
multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based
on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to
capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of
preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector
quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'
behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and
scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible
information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear
unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency
analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with
computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial
systems.

Motivation: 传统基于嵌入的用户画像缺乏可解释性和适应性，而现有文本画像方法受限于固定格式，无法捕捉用户行为的多样性。

Method: LettinGo通过三个阶段实现：1）利用多个LLMs探索多样用户画像；2）基于推荐系统性能评估画像质量；3）通过任务性能生成的成对偏好数据对齐画像生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，LettinGo显著提升了推荐系统的准确性、灵活性和上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: LettinGo为下一代推荐系统提供了一种创新的用户画像生成方法。

Abstract: User profiling is pivotal for recommendation systems, as it transforms raw
user interaction data into concise and structured representations that drive
personalized recommendations. While traditional embedding-based profiles lack
interpretability and adaptability, recent advances with large language models
(LLMs) enable text-based profiles that are semantically richer and more
transparent. However, existing methods often adhere to fixed formats that limit
their ability to capture the full diversity of user behaviors. In this paper,
we introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive
user profiles. By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating
direct feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the
rigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with
task-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and
effective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user
profiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their
impact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation
through pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation
accuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness. This work enhances profile
generation as a key innovation for next-generation recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives by impacting
user experience across various domains, including e-commerce, job
advertisements, entertainment, etc. Given the vital role of such systems in our
lives, practitioners must ensure they do not produce unfair and imbalanced
recommendations. Previous work addressing bias in recommendations overlooked
bias in certain item categories, potentially leaving some biases unaddressed.
Additionally, most previous work on fair re-ranking focused on binary-sensitive
attributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a
fairness-aware re-ranking approach that helps mitigate bias in different
categories of items. This re-ranking approach leverages existing biases to
correct disparities in recommendations across various demographic groups. We
show how our approach can mitigate bias on multiple sensitive attributes,
including gender, age, and occupation. We experimented on three real-world
datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our re-ranking scheme in mitigating
bias in recommendations. Our results show how this approach helps mitigate
social bias with little to no degradation in performance.

Abstract: Sensitive data captured by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a large role
in the safety and integrity of many critical infrastructures. Detection of
anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning
is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based
machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous
behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of
quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid
Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform
traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores.
Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real
IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels.
This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics.
Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in
kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential
"quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This
effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly
detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical
infrastructures.

Result: 模拟和实际应用表明，贝叶斯估计在截断数据中提供了更稳定和可靠的参数估计，尤其在似然曲面不规则时表现优越。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推断在截断分布参数估计中具有明显优势，特别适用于时间到事件数据分析。

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a foundational step in statistical modeling, enabling
us to extract knowledge from data and apply it effectively. Bayesian estimation
of parameters incorporates prior beliefs with observed data to infer
distribution parameters probabilistically and robustly. Moreover, it provides
full posterior distributions, allowing uncertainty quantification and
regularization, especially useful in small or truncated samples. Utilizing the
left-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution is particularly well-suited for
modeling time-to-event data where observations are subject to a known lower
bound such as precipitation data and cancer survival times. In this paper, we
propose a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the LTLL
distribution with a fixed truncation point \( x_L > 0 \). Given a random
variable \( X \sim LL(\alpha, \beta; x_L) \), where \( \alpha > 0 \) is the
scale parameter and \( \beta > 0 \) is the shape parameter, the likelihood
function is derived based on a truncated sample \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N \) with
\( X_i > x_L \). We assume independent prior distributions for the parameters,
and the posterior inference is conducted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
specifically using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain posterior
estimates \( \hat{\alpha} \) and \( \hat{\beta} \). Through simulation studies
and real-world applications, we demonstrate that Bayesian estimation provides
more stable and reliable parameter estimates, particularly when the likelihood
surface is irregular due to left truncation. The results highlight the
advantages of Bayesian inference outperform the estimation of parameter
uncertainty in truncated distributions for time to event data analysis.

TL;DR: GRASP是一个基于NBP先验的贝叶斯框架，用于分组预测回归，通过直接控制尾部行为实现灵活稀疏性，无需复杂层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分组预测回归中的稀疏性问题，提供更灵活和高效的稀疏性控制方法。

Method: 使用NBP先验直接控制尾部行为，提出新的框架量化组内收缩参数相关性，并引入高效的Metropolis-Hastings采样器。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中验证了GRASP的鲁棒性和多功能性。

Conclusion: GRASP提供了一种简单而强大的方法，适用于不同稀疏性和信噪比的分组回归问题。

Abstract: We introduce GRASP, a simple Bayesian framework for regression with grouped
predictors, built on the normal beta prime (NBP) prior. The NBP prior is an
adaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters
that control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong
shrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the
group inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into
structured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is
sufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the
non-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the
NBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive
sparsity within and across groups. A key contribution of this work is a novel
framework to explicitly quantify correlations among shrinkage parameters within
a group, providing deeper insights into grouped shrinkage behavior. We also
introduce an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for hyperparameter
estimation. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the
robustness and versatility of GRASP across grouped regression problems with
varying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet
traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they
have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces
Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)
framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies,
porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of
the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology
included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per
property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over
19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection
over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and
visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and
property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for
facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with
moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,
FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA
0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological
realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss
curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to
traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property
mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D
constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling
(Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in
geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science
initiatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷蒸汽重整是广泛使用的制氢技术，但现有模型仅适用于单一状态（动力学或平衡态），限制了其应用。需要一种统一模型以优化过程控制。

Method: 利用包含实验、插值和理论数据的综合数据集训练人工神经网络，通过数据增强和权重分配优化训练。评估了贝叶斯优化和随机采样方法。

Result: 最优模型对反应后混合物组成具有高预测精度（均方误差0.000498，皮尔逊相关系数0.927），并能提供连续导数。

Conclusion: 该替代模型在动力学和平衡态下均表现出鲁棒性，为甲烷蒸汽重整的设计和优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for
efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used
technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where
hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and
optimized process control through numerical simulations. Existing models
typically address either kinetic or equilibrium regimes, limiting their
applicability. Here we show a surrogate model capable of unifying both regimes.
An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes
experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data,
and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data
augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced
training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the
optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the
post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean
squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927.
The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions
makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results
confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming
in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design
and process optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测对投资决策和风险管理至关重要，但由于市场的非线性动态和时变相关性，传统静态模型难以捕捉动态关系。

Method: 提出DGT框架，通过差分图机制整合序列图结构变化到多头自注意力中，并评估多种相关性度量（如Pearson、互信息等）作为空间注意力先验。

Result: DGT在S&P 500数据上表现优于GRU基线（RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87），Kendall's Tau全局矩阵效果最佳（MAE: 0.11）。聚类分析揭示了不同股票类别的预测误差差异。

Conclusion: DGT创新性地结合了动态图结构和Transformer，验证了动态关系建模的有效性，并识别了最优相关性度量和范围，为金融时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management,
yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying
inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture
evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph
Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price
prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into
multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively
preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal
attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further
evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's
Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10
years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),
DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).
Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means
clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks,
with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.
Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study
innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers,
validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation
metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies.
Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic
modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.

Motivation: 传统的数值模拟方法（如有限元法）在模拟移动热源的热传递问题时计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 将时间区间划分为小段，通过迁移学习在单个网络上逐步训练，利用前一区间的解作为下一区间的初始条件。

Result: 该方法能够高效计算大时间区间内的温度分布，与传统有限元方法结果一致。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保持网络简单的同时，显著提高了计算效率，适用于移动热源的热传递模拟。

Abstract: In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) is employed for
the numerical simulation of heat transfer involving a moving source. To reduce
the computational effort, a new training method is proposed that uses a
continuous time-stepping through transfer learning. Within this, the time
interval is divided into smaller intervals and a single network is initialized.
On this single network each time interval is trained with the initial condition
for (n+1)th as the solution obtained at nth time increment. Thus, this
framework enables the computation of large temporal intervals without
increasing the complexity of the network itself. The proposed framework is used
to estimate the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium with a moving
heat source. The results from the proposed framework is compared with
traditional finite element method and a good agreement is seen.

Motivation: 提升深度神经网络降阶模型在参数依赖PDE问题中的预测能力，并通过变分正确的损失函数实现严格的精度认证。

Method: 利用超弱间断Petrov Galerkin（DPG）离散化构建变分正确的损失函数，并通过椭圆PDE实例验证其有效性。

Result: 数值和理论结果表明，在高对比度扩散参数下，DPG损失函数比简单最小二乘损失表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的DPG损失函数不仅适用于特定实例，还可推广到其他具有稳定DPG公式的问题中，尤其在处理高对比度扩散场时效果显著。

Abstract: We develop, analyze, and experimentally explore residual-based loss functions
for machine learning of parameter-to-solution maps in the context of
parameter-dependent families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our
primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction
capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by
the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example
of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a
loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG)
discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed
concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which
stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion
fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both
numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast
diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust
performance than simpler least-squares losses.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于DDIM的新型框架，用于预测脑癌放疗中肿瘤的时空动态变化，以优化个性化治疗策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑癌放疗中剂量和时机的个性化调整对治疗效果至关重要，但现有模型难以捕捉肿瘤的动态响应。

Method: 采用Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models（DDIM），开发了单步和迭代去噪策略，模拟肿瘤的时空演化。

Result: 扩散模型能有效模拟患者特异性肿瘤演化，并定位与治疗响应相关的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为个性化放疗提供了新工具，有望实现更精准的早期干预。

Abstract: Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and
timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability
is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or
staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction
approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To
address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic
Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment
based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and
other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early
treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However,
current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving
spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM),
which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this
study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared
their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively
simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with
treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for
modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive
interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically
informed radiotherapy.

Motivation: 个性化精准放疗需要识别预后和空间信息特征，并根据个体反应调整治疗。

Method: 对比标准放射组学、基于梯度的特征和卷积神经网络（增强CAM）三种方法，分析69例脑转移瘤数据。

Result: 像素级CAM在分类准确性上优于其他方法，并提供更细致的空间特征。

Conclusion: 像素级CAM有望指导个性化放疗策略，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple
classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially
informative features and the ability to adapt treatment based on individual
response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment
response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural
networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain
metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An
integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor
volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed
as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in
hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity.
Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight,
identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns,
demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated
regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed
both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover,
its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data,
supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous
treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings
underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy
strategies for both photon and particle therapies.

Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and
presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The
discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions
degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied
to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has
been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing
multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization
approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault
features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific
multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect
fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the
extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely
studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact
on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the
model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall
generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing
end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically
in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a
real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,
aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant
operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with
a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant
fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the
source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks,
where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to
constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a
state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource
allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient
methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and
viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals
supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are
learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve
through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies
during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how
near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be
accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN
parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers
sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of
state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit
power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential
probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality
gaps.

*Huan Liu,Pengfei Jiao,Mengzhou Gao,Chaochao Chen,Di Jin*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的异质时序超图神经网络（HTHGN），用于捕捉复杂异质时序图中的高阶交互关系，解决了现有方法忽略高阶拓扑信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表示学习方法主要关注低阶拓扑信息，忽略了高阶交互关系，且超图方法仅适用于静态同质图，无法建模异质时序图中的高阶交互。

Method: 提出异质时序超图的定义和P-均匀超边构建算法，并设计HTHGN模型，结合分层注意力机制和对比学习，捕捉高阶交互和丰富语义。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验验证了HTHGN的有效性，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: HTHGN成功建模了异质时序图中的高阶交互，为复杂网络分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for
modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in
real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous
temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful
applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus
on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order
group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world
networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static
homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in
HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order
interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of
heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge
construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a
novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to
fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical
attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal
message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich
semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN
performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order
correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural
ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets
verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order
interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何更灵活地衡量图之间的距离，特别是在节点和边不匹配时的惩罚机制。

Method: 提出了一种通用的图GOSPA度量家族，通过线性编程近似计算，并在仿真和真实数据集上验证其性能。

Result: 实验表明，该度量家族在不同超参数选择下表现良好，并在分类任务中显示出优势。

Conclusion: 提出的图GOSPA度量家族为图距离测量提供了更灵活的框架，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between
graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of
the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also
proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric,
the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs
for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes.
However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for
edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the
graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear
programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the
characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different
choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric
family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 研究了在线TSP和DARP问题，提出空间局部性模型，利用有限未来信息改进竞争比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受实际应用（如Uber/Lyft）启发，利用有限未来请求信息优化服务效率。

Method: 提出空间局部性模型，提供服务器当前位置附近未来请求的距离信息。

Result: 证明空间局部性可改进竞争比，适用于任意度量空间。

Conclusion: 有限未来信息能有效提升在线路由问题的性能。

Abstract: We consider the online versions of two fundamental routing problems,
traveling salesman (TSP) and dial-a-ride (DARP), which have a variety of
relevant applications in logistics and robotics. The online versions of these
problems concern with efficiently serving a sequence of requests presented in a
real-time on-line fashion located at points of a metric space by servers
(salesmen/vehicles/robots). In this paper, motivated from real-world
applications, such as Uber/Lyft rides, where some limited knowledge is
available on the future requests, we propose the {\em spatial locality} model
that provides in advance the distance within which new request(s) will be
released from the current position of server(s). We study the usefulness of
this advanced information on achieving the improved competitive ratios for both
the problems with $k\geq 1$ servers, compared to the competitive results
established in the literature without such spatial locality consideration. We
show that small locality is indeed useful in obtaining improved competitive
ratios irrespective of the metric space.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过简单查询学习未知分区的问题，分析了不同查询类型和算法适应性对查询复杂度的影响，并给出了确定性查询复杂度的完整刻画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的基本动机是解决在聚类、主动学习和众包等应用中，如何通过减少适应性并最小化查询复杂度来高效学习未知分区的问题。

Method: 论文采用了确定性查询复杂度分析，研究了非自适应和自适应算法，并扩展到子集查询（弱查询和强查询）。

Result: 结果表明，对于任何常数轮数r，查询复杂度为Θ(n^(1+1/(2^r-1))k^(1-1/(2^r-1)))，并且使用弱查询的非自适应算法可以达到接近最优的复杂度。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析，为学习未知分区问题提供了查询复杂度的完整刻画，并展示了在不同查询类型和适应性条件下的最优算法设计。

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$
elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information
about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied
pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same
class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries,
while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known
algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the
last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and
relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many
applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing
query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic
query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$,
interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant
$r$, the query complexity is
$\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs
$O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of
size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes
intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire
partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries
on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show
$\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up
to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly
matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of
both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于连通分量数量的新查询模型，用于图重构问题，并证明了自适应查询的上下界以及非自适应查询的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图重构问题在不同查询模型下的表现，特别是基于连通分量数量的查询模型，这是图参数中最基础且重要的一个。

Method: 提出一种新的查询模型，通过子集查询返回诱导子图的连通分量数量，分析自适应和非自适应查询的复杂度。

Result: 证明了自适应查询的期望复杂度为Θ(m log n / log m)，非自适应查询的下界为Ω(n²)，并提供了一个仅需两轮自适应的O(m log n + n log² n)查询算法。

Conclusion: 新查询模型在图重构问题中具有高效的自适应查询性能，但非自适应查询复杂度较高。

Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various
query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number
of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph
parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node
$m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a
subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in
the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in
expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the
graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are
required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$
query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.

*Sachin Garg,Michał Dereziński*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Block-Nyström方法通过引入块对角结构，显著降低了Nyström方法的计算成本，同时保持了良好的近似性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当数据具有重尾谱衰减时，Nyström方法的计算成本可能过高，需要一种更高效的近似方法。

Method: 提出Block-Nyström算法，结合多个较小的Nyström近似，并在计算预算内提供更强的谱尾估计。

Result: Block-Nyström可用于构建二阶优化的改进预处理器，并高效解决核岭回归问题。

Conclusion: Block-Nyström在相同计算预算下优于传统Nyström方法，并提供新的统计学习边界。

Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large
matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the
data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the
problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of
our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an
algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method,
thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong
approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct
improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to
efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert
spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational
budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger
tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along
the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently
inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning
bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.

TL;DR: 论文分析了生成式AI与传统预测式AI的不同特征，指出现有政策工具可能不适用，并提出针对生成式AI的新政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的出现挑战了现有AI监管框架的假设，需要重新评估政策工具的有效性。

Method: 识别生成式AI的四个独特方面，分析其对政策的影响，并提出三项建议。

Result: 生成式AI的通用性、评估难度、法律问题和分布式结构要求新的政策应对。

Conclusion: 政策制定者需区分现有政策的适用性，并针对生成式AI的独特风险设计新政策。

Abstract: Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools
to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools
were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and
therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the
utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,
however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt
to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.
  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call
for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and
adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the
difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change
the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed
structure of the generative AI value chain.
  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the
past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to
address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline
three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory
targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern
generative AI.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现六种流行的大型语言模型（LLMs）在评估180个国家的新闻自由时存在系统性偏差，包括负面偏差、差异偏差和本国偏见，与专家评估的世界新闻自由指数（WPFI）不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球信息获取中的作用日益重要，其偏差可能影响公众对民主制度（如新闻自由）的理解和信任。

Method: 研究比较了六种LLMs对180个国家新闻自由的评估与WPFI专家评估的差异。

Result: LLMs普遍低估新闻自由，差异偏差显示其对新闻自由较高的国家低估更严重，且多数模型对本国存在正面偏见。

Conclusion: 若LLMs成为重要文化工具，需确保其对全球人权和公民权利的准确描述。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information
access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the
potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic
institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic
distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries
compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six
LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press
freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less
free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:
LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is
strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,
rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be
expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some
cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than
expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the
most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate
representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally.

Conclusion: 混合人机方法在生成有效辅导培训课程方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We explore the automatic generation of interactive, scenario-based lessons
designed to train novice human tutors who teach middle school mathematics
online. Employing prompt engineering through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
approach with GPT-4o, we developed a system capable of creating structured
tutor training lessons. Our study generated lessons in English for three key
topics: Encouraging Students' Independence, Encouraging Help-Seeking Behavior,
and Turning on Cameras, using a task decomposition prompting strategy that
breaks lesson generation into sub-tasks. The generated lessons were evaluated
by two human evaluators, who provided both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations using a comprehensive rubric informed by lesson design research.
Results demonstrate that the task decomposition strategy led to higher-rated
lessons compared to single-step generation. Human evaluators identified several
strengths in the LLM-generated lessons, including well-structured content and
time-saving potential, while also noting limitations such as generic feedback
and a lack of clarity in some instructional sections. These findings underscore
the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches for generating effective lessons in
tutor training.

Conclusion: 研究为VTA在真实课堂中的部署提供了可行性评估，并指出了推广中的关键挑战，同时开源了VTA系统代码。

Abstract: Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback
and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their
effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving
their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA
and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate
students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA's performance evolve
over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages
of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student--VTA interaction pairs to
identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these
interactions with traditional student--human instructor interactions to
evaluate the VTA's role in the learning process. Through a large-scale
empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of
deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader
adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering
future advancements in AI-driven education:

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect
distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained
attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods
are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate
on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g.,
motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g.,
smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed
behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors
provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach
that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use.
Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart
rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal
model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of
integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of
deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

Abstract: As e-commerce rapidly integrates artificial intelligence for content creation
and product recommendations, these technologies offer significant benefits in
personalization and efficiency. AI-driven systems automate product
descriptions, generate dynamic advertisements, and deliver tailored
recommendations based on consumer behavior, as seen in major platforms like
Amazon and Shopify. However, the widespread use of AI in e-commerce raises
crucial ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, algorithmic bias,
and consumer autonomy. Bias -- whether cultural, gender-based, or socioeconomic
-- can be inadvertently embedded in AI models, leading to inequitable product
recommendations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This paper examines the
ethical implications of AI-driven content creation and product recommendations,
emphasizing the need for frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and need
for more established and robust ethical standards. We propose actionable best
practices to remove bias and ensure inclusivity, such as conducting regular
audits of algorithms, diversifying training data, and incorporating fairness
metrics into AI models. Additionally, we discuss frameworks for ethical
conformance that focus on safeguarding consumer data privacy, promoting
transparency in decision-making processes, and enhancing consumer autonomy. By
addressing these issues, we provide guidelines for responsibly utilizing AI in
e-commerce applications for content creation and product recommendations,
ensuring that these technologies are both effective and ethically sound.

Motivation: 政治回音室现象需要去除政治文章中的主观偏见和情绪化语言，但以往研究仅关注文本，忽略了图像的偏见传播作用。

Method: 模型分为四步：1) 图像文本对齐（CLIP模型）；2) 图像偏见评分（ViT分类器）；3) 文本去偏见（BERT模型）；4) 最终去偏见（替换为中性内容）。

Result: 文本去偏见能识别大量偏见词，ViT模型训练有效，语义对齐高效，但需更多训练时间和资源。

Conclusion: 模型初步有效，但需进一步优化和人工评估以确保语义一致性。

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to
detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both
the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on
solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image
portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium
to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that
leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.
Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their
bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias
score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting
biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three
steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and
the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by
comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is
promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many
potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective
training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,
particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A
human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of
the newly generated text and images.

selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few
efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level
adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose
and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem
selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models
and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding
can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to
complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered.
Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection
algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that
preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that
while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its
practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and
engaged at higher levels of difficulty.

TL;DR: 研究应用机器学习和软件工程分析巴尔的摩市空气污染水平，发现空气污染与历史偏见保险评估方法显著相关，揭示了种族和收入不平等对污染分布的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨巴尔的摩市空气污染水平与历史偏见政策（如保险风险评估方法）及人口统计学因素（如种族和收入）的关联。

Method: 使用三种主要数据源：1）有偏见的保险风险评估方法，2）巴尔的摩居民人口统计数据，3）NO2和PM2.5浓度的普查数据。数据集覆盖650,643名巴尔的摩居民及全美202个主要城市的4470万居民。

Result: 空气污染水平与偏见保险评估方法显著相关，低收入街区与高收入街区在NO2水平上存在明显差异，种族间污染水平也存在不平等。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了历史政策如何持续影响巴尔的摩居民的生活质量，尤其是对有色人种和低收入群体的不平等影响。

Abstract: In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in
analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed
with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance
risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore
residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The
dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202
major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear
association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities
present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar
disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As
Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the
finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and
affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today.

TL;DR: MAARTA是一个多智能体框架，通过分析视线模式和放射报告提供个性化反馈，帮助放射学学生改进视觉搜索和诊断解释错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学学生因缺乏专家指导时间而难以培养感知技能，导致视觉搜索和诊断解释错误，现有AI系统未能有效解决这些问题。

Method: MAARTA通过动态选择智能体分析视线行为和报告差异，利用结构化图表比较专家与学生行为，并提供逐步提示帮助学生理解错误。

Result: MAARTA能够识别遗漏发现并分析差异，帮助学生改进诊断推理。

Conclusion: MAARTA通过多智能体框架和个性化反馈，推动了AI驱动的放射学教育发展。

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to
limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and
diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations,
short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by
current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how
and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic
Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes
gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike
single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error
complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and
student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed
findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.
MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their
errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology
education.

*Kenric P. Nelson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文探讨了归一化Tsallis熵（NTE）的不稳定性问题，并提出耦合熵作为解决方案，适用于复杂系统建模和机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Tsallis熵在归一化时的不稳定性问题，并寻找适用于复杂系统的稳健熵度量。

Method: 提出耦合熵，通过引入耦合参数κ和维度d，将NTE除以1+dκ，以增强稳定性。

Result: 耦合熵及其最大化分布（耦合指数族）为复杂系统提供了稳健的熵度量，并能衡量统计复杂性。

Conclusion: 耦合熵是复杂系统中非线性性和非加性熵的有效度量，适用于机器学习和复杂系统建模。

Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful
toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes,
a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy
are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to
$p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not
normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE);
however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide
evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary
robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for
the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential
family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables
$(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems,
$q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter
governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the
parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex
systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential
distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is
a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.

Result: 在多个领域（如相变、生物基因电路等）验证了LSE-ICNN的有效性。

Conclusion: LSE-ICNN在保持可微性和凸性的同时，能够灵活建模复杂多模态问题。

Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as
phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across
physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture
representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a
log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes.
This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a
smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for
gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both
the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression,
enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of
the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase
transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological
gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability
distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in
capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability,
making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and
physical simulation.

Abstract: This monograph studies the relations between two approaches using positive
definite kernels: probabilistic methods using Gaussian processes, and
non-probabilistic methods using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). They
are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical
analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for
fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration,
distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample
path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these
equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian
Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many
other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are
developed in parallel by the two research communities.

Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly
evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide
faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and
universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path
theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for
modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling -
common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path
signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of
models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,
bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and
kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature
kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;
the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight
space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based
models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion
processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph
neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature
Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and
Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian
processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting
mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context
length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual
bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in
scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.

Motivation: 现有数据增强方法在同时应对数据损坏和对抗攻击时仍有不足，需改进模型鲁棒性。

Method: 集成Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化（W-DRO）与多种数据增强策略，提出DRO-Augment框架。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C等基准数据集上，优于现有方法，保持干净数据准确性的同时提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DRO-Augment有效提升模型鲁棒性，理论分析为神经网络训练提供了新的泛化误差界。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of
deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification
tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation
techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained
model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for
improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel
framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization
(W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of
the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method
outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and
adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean
datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we
establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a
computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related
to the W-DRO problem.

Conclusion: 改进方法提升了置信区域的稳定性和大小，同时保持了覆盖保证，数值实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in
systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent
nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence
regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by
working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds
are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small
samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an
approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs
are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to
aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and
region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their
simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through
numerical experiments.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如医疗定价数据）上验证，ICCNLS相比传统CNLS和DC回归方法具有更高的预测精度和模型简洁性。

Conclusion: 统计可识别性与凸凹结构及子梯度正则化的结合，可生成适用于预测、基准和政策评估的可解释模型。

Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric regression method that models complex
input-output relationships as the sum of convex and concave components. The
method-Identifiable Convex-Concave Nonparametric Least Squares
(ICCNLS)-decomposes the target function into additive shape-constrained
components, each represented via sub-gradient-constrained affine functions. To
address the affine ambiguity inherent in convex-concave decompositions, we
introduce global statistical orthogonality constraints, ensuring that residuals
are uncorrelated with both intercept and input variables. This enforces
decomposition identifiability and improves interpretability. We further
incorporate L1, L2 and elastic net regularisation on sub-gradients to enhance
generalisation and promote structural sparsity. The proposed method is
evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including healthcare pricing
data, and demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and model simplicity
compared to conventional CNLS and difference-of-convex (DC) regression
approaches. Our results show that statistical identifiability, when paired with
convex-concave structure and sub-gradient regularisation, yields interpretable
models suited for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation.

Motivation: 探索下降相位检索算法的理论极限，理解其行为背后的数学机制，并开发实用的算法变体。

Method: 利用随机对偶理论（RDT）开发通用程序，研究参数流形及其漏斗点，并通过理论和模拟验证相变现象。

Result: 发现参数流形从多漏斗点结构过渡到单漏斗点结构时，算法性能发生相变，从失败转为成功。理论和模拟结果在小维度下高度一致。

Conclusion: 参数流形的结构变化是算法性能的关键因素，理论和实验结果验证了相变现象，为算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms.
Utilizing \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) we develop a generic program that
allows statistical characterization of various algorithmic performance metrics.
Through these we identify the concepts of \emph{parametric manifold} and its
\emph{funneling points} as key mathematical objects that govern the underlying
algorithms' behavior. An isomorphism between single funneling point manifolds
and global convergence of descending algorithms is established. The structure
and shape of the parametric manifold as well as its dependence on the sample
complexity are studied through both plain and lifted RDT. Emergence of a phase
transition is observed. Namely, as sample complexity increases, parametric
manifold transitions from a multi to a single funneling point structure. This
in return corresponds to a transition from the scenarios where descending
algorithms generically fail to the scenarios where they succeed in solving
phase retrieval. We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant
that in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient
descent. Even though the theoretical results are obtained for infinite
dimensional scenarios (and consequently non-jittery parametric manifolds), we
observe a strong agrement between theoretical and simulated phase transitions
predictions for fairly small dimensions on the order of a few hundreds.

TL;DR: 论文研究了谱初始化器与下降相位检索算法（dPR）理论极限的关系，提出了一种基于随机对偶理论（RDT）的方法来统计描述最优谱初始化器（OptSpins），并分析了其对dPR算法性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解dPR算法在相位检索（PR）中的理论极限，特别是通过分析最优谱初始化器的功能结构和起始重叠，以确定算法是否能绕过平坦区域达到全局最优解。

Method: 方法包括开发基于随机对偶理论（RDT）的通用程序，统计描述最优谱初始化器（OptSpins），并通过数值模拟验证理论预测。

Result: 结果表明，dPR的理论相变可能难以实现，因为平坦区域较大；而通过增加样本复杂度比（α）可以缩小平坦区域，使OptSpins避开这些区域，从而成功解决PR。

Conclusion: 结论指出，通过略微增加样本复杂度比（如15%）可以优化dPR算法的性能，使其成功绕过平坦区域并达到全局最优解。

Abstract: We analyze the relation between spectral initializers and theoretical limits
of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR). In companion paper
[104], for any sample complexity ratio, $\alpha$, \emph{parametric manifold},
${\mathcal {PM}}(\alpha)$, is recognized as a critically important structure
that generically determines dPRs abilities to solve phase retrieval (PR).
Moreover, overlap between the algorithmic solution and the true signal is
positioned as a key ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s component. We here consider the
so-called \emph{overlap optimal} spectral initializers (OptSpins) as dPR's
starting points and develop a generic \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based
program to statistically characterize them. In particular, we determine the
functional structure of OptSpins and evaluate the starting overlaps that they
provide for the dPRs. Since ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s so-called \emph{flat regions}
are highly susceptible to \emph{local jitteriness} and as such are key
obstacles on dPR's path towards PR's global optimum, a precise characterization
of the starting overlap allows to determine if such regions can be successfully
circumvented. Through the presented theoretical analysis we observe two key
points in that regard: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} dPR's theoretical phase transition
(critical $\alpha$ above which they solve PR) might be difficult to practically
achieve as the ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s flat regions are large causing the
associated OptSpins to fall exactly within them; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}}
Opting for so-called ``\emph{safer compression}'' and slightly increasing
$\alpha$ (by say $15\%$) shrinks flat regions and allows OptSpins to fall
outside them and dPRs to ultimately solve PR. Numerical simulations are
conducted as well and shown to be in an excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions.

Result: 确定了dPR成功的最小样本复杂度比的相变位置，理论与小规模模拟结果高度吻合。

Conclusion: RDT程序成功推广到更一般的PR问题，理论与实验结果一致，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Companion paper [118] developed a powerful \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT)
based analytical program to statistically characterize performance of
\emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR) (these include all variants
of gradient descents and among them widely popular Wirtinger flows). We here
generalize the program and show how it can be utilized to handle rank $d$
positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements (with special cases $d=1$
and $d=2$ serving as emulations of the real and complex phase retrievals,
respectively). In particular, we observe that the minimal sample complexity
ratio (number of measurements scaled by the dimension of the unknown signal)
which ensures dPR's success exhibits a phase transition (PT) phenomenon. For
both plain and lifted RDT we determine phase transitions locations. To
complement theoretical results we implement a log barrier gradient descent
variant and observe that, even in small dimensional scenarios (with problem
sizes on the order of 100), the simulated phase transitions are in an excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分布偏移下的不确定性估计问题。

Abstract: Neural networks make accurate predictions but often fail to provide reliable
uncertainty estimates, especially under covariate distribution shifts between
training and testing. To address this problem, we propose a Bayesian framework
for uncertainty estimation that explicitly accounts for covariate shifts. While
conventional approaches rely on fixed priors, the key idea of our method is an
adaptive prior, conditioned on both training and new covariates. This prior
naturally increases uncertainty for inputs that lie far from the training
distribution in regions where predictive performance is likely to degrade. To
efficiently approximate the resulting posterior predictive distribution, we
employ amortized variational inference. Finally, we construct synthetic
environments by drawing small bootstrap samples from the training data,
simulating a range of plausible covariate shift using only the original
dataset. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data. It
yields substantially improved uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Neural estimators are simulation-based estimators for the parameters of a
family of statistical models, which build a direct mapping from the sample to
the parameter vector. They benefit from the versatility of available network
architectures and efficient training methods developed in the field of deep
learning. Neural estimators are amortized in the sense that, once trained, they
can be applied to any new data set with almost no computational cost. While
many papers have shown very good performance of these methods in simulation
studies and real-world applications, so far no statistical guarantees are
available to support these observations theoretically. In this work, we study
the risk of neural estimators by decomposing it into several terms that can be
analyzed separately. We formulate easy-to-check assumptions ensuring that each
term converges to zero, and we verify them for popular applications of neural
estimators. Our results provide a general recipe to derive theoretical
guarantees also for broader classes of architectures and estimation problems.

Abstract: Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the
data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear
whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this
paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process
regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have
reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is
interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several
experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR
model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks
such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation. Source

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is fundamental for training deep neural
networks, especially in non-convex settings. Understanding SGD's generalization
properties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex
learning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which
accommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization
error bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the
flatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,
significantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,
where n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting
an optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further
refined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory
term is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across
iterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which
increase with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter
generalization error bounds for both loss function types. Our theoretical
results are validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of T2pm-SGD in
establishing tighter generalization bounds.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning (ML) by enabling
efficient modeling of global dependencies across inputs. Their inherently
parallelizable structures allow for efficient scaling with the exponentially
increasing size of both pretrained data and model parameters. Yet, despite
their central role as the computational backbone of modern large language
models (LLMs), the theoretical understanding of Attentions, especially in the
nonlinear setting, remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the \emph{in-context
memorization error} of \emph{nonlinear Attention}, in the high-dimensional
proportional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and their embedding
dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Leveraging recent advances in the
theory of large kernel random matrices, we show that nonlinear Attention
typically incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on
random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the
input exhibits statistical structure, particularly when the Attention weights
align with the input signal direction. Our results reveal how nonlinearity and
input structure interact with each other to govern the memorization performance
of nonlinear Attention. The theoretical insights are supported by numerical
experiments.

Abstract: High-dimensional data are ubiquitous, with examples ranging from natural
images to scientific datasets, and often reside near low-dimensional manifolds.
Leveraging this geometric structure is vital for downstream tasks, including
signal denoising, reconstruction, and generation. However, in practice, the
manifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A
fundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging,
which is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold
fitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
works that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold
setting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of
a two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn
from a $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$, under a
relatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach
$\tau$. We show that with high probability, the averaged point $\hat{\mathbf
q}$ achieves the bound $d(\hat{\mathbf q}, \mathcal M) \leq \sigma
\sqrt{d\left(1+\frac{\kappa\mathrm{diam}(\mathcal {M})}{\log(D)}\right)}$,
where $\sigma, \mathrm{diam(\mathcal M)},\kappa$ denote the standard deviation
of the Gaussian noise, manifold's diameter and a bound on its extrinsic
curvature, respectively. This is the first analysis of local averaging accuracy
over the manifold in the relatively high noise regime where $\sigma \sqrt{D}
\approx \tau$. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step for a wide
range of provable methods designed for lower-noise regimes. Additionally, our
framework can provide a theoretical foundation for a broad spectrum of
denoising and dimensionality reduction methods that rely on local averaging
techniques.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通用视觉语言模型（VLM）通过轻量级微调可媲美或超越医疗专用VLM，尤其在跨领域任务中表现优异，为医疗影像领域提供了一种高效、经济的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨通用VLM（如CLIP、LLaVA）是否通过微调能在特定医疗影像任务中与医疗专用VLM竞争，以减少计算和数据资源需求。

Method: 系统评估通用与医疗VLM在疾病诊断和视觉问答（VQA）任务中的表现，包括现成性能差距、微调效果及跨领域泛化能力。

Result: 医疗专用预训练在领域内任务中有优势，但通用VLM通过轻量级微调（如LoRA）可匹配或超越医疗模型，并在跨领域任务中展现出强适应性。

Conclusion: 通用VLM结合微调是一种可扩展且经济高效的替代方案，挑战了医疗专用预训练的必要性，为未来医疗影像研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for
diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources.
Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not
trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key
question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs
for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates
common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering
(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf
performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges
these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen
medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in
ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after
lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective
among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong
adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific
pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs
with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing
large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the
medical imaging field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIR图像缺乏颜色和纹理信息，现有方法因单波段限制导致图像失真和语义模糊，多波段红外图像提供了更丰富的光谱数据。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过多波段光谱信息和Transformer架构，成功解决了红外图像彩色化中的语义模糊问题。

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,
are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.
However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting
downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization
methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information
and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image
distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery
provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details
and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral
information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework
employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as
the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention
computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral
attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and
reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a
Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped
architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale
wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency
dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC,
progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional
techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

Motivation: 血管内取栓后无复流现象会阻碍组织恢复并恶化临床结果，但目前依赖术后24小时MRI检测，延迟干预。

Method: 研究回顾性分析了UCLA医学中心的患者数据，从DSA序列中提取统计和时序灌注特征，训练机器学习分类器预测无复流。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时、准确预测无复流奠定了基础，使临床医生能主动管理高风险患者，无需依赖延迟影像。

Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular
thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a
complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular
hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes.
Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on
perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure,
delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine
learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by
leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis
included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved
favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI.
No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on
post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we
extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target
downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our
novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC:
0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331
$\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode
critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a
foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to
proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

TL;DR: M³Bind提出了一种无需显式配对数据的多模态医学图像对齐预训练框架，通过共享文本表示空间实现跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析需要整合多模态信息以提高诊断准确性，但现有方法（如CLIP）需要显式配对数据，这在医学领域难以获取。

Method: M³Bind通过微调预训练的CLIP类模型，对齐模态特定文本嵌入空间，并蒸馏为统一模型，构建共享文本表示空间。

Conclusion: M³Bind有效实现了医学图像的跨模态对齐，为医学分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法中图像分割导致潜在变量信息分布不均，引发后验坍塌和潜在变量利用率低的问题。

Method: 提出LVPNet，引入全局多尺度感知模块（GMSM）提取紧凑的潜在表示，并提出量化补偿模块（QCM）减少量化损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LVPNet的压缩效率优于现有无损图像压缩方法，同时保持推理速度。

Conclusion: LVPNet通过全局潜在变量和量化补偿，显著提升了无损医学图像压缩的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image
autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in
lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image
segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable
information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and
inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we
propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method
named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and
encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we
introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact
and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively
capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to
mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the
Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of
quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for
quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining
competitive inference speed. The code is at

Motivation: HER2阳性乳腺癌诊断依赖昂贵的IHC技术，而H&E染色虽普及但缺乏特异性，需一种高效替代方案。

Method: 改进金字塔pix2pix的损失函数，引入方差惩罚项以避免GAN模式崩溃，提升生成图像的多样性。

Abstract: The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in
breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly
aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is
costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In
contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological
procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study
proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to
generate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling
cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of
pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in
generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based
penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model
particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have
remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological
variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset
demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak
signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet
Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive
(IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior
performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its
potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward
AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to
traditional HER2 diagnostics.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in
cross-modal semantic understanding between visual and textual modalities. Given
the intrinsic need for multi-modal integration in clinical applications, VLMs
have emerged as a promising solution for a wide range of medical image analysis
tasks. However, adapting general-purpose VLMs to medical domain poses numerous
challenges, such as large domain gaps, complicated pathological variations, and
diversity and uniqueness of different tasks. The central purpose of this review
is to systematically summarize recent advances in adapting VLMs for medical
image analysis, analyzing current challenges, and recommending promising yet
urgent directions for further investigations. We begin by introducing core
learning strategies for medical VLMs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and
prompt learning. We then categorize five major VLM adaptation strategies for
medical image analysis. These strategies are further analyzed across eleven
medical imaging tasks to illustrate their current practical implementations.
Furthermore, we analyze key challenges that impede the effective adaptation of
VLMs to clinical applications and discuss potential directions for future
research. We also provide an open-access repository of related literature to
facilitate further research, available at
https://github.com/haonenglin/Awesome-VLM-for-MIA. It is anticipated that this
article can help researchers who are interested in harnessing VLMs in medical
image analysis tasks have a better understanding on their capabilities and
limitations, as well as current technical barriers, to promote their
innovative, robust, and safe application in clinical practice.

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior
structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and
fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be
challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.
In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and
bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal
fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels
across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I
is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin
vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus
image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase
intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and
background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for
classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the
proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior
performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy
of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also
demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE
images, confirming its generalization ability.

Abstract: Synthetic contrast enhancement offers fast image acquisition and eliminates
the need for intravenous injection of contrast agent. This is particularly
beneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are
significantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as
a widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.
Neural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to
model evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we
introduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further
refines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled
imaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling
adaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to
resemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a
physiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously
train and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its
effectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of
images that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.

Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine
learning model for diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in
endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers,
including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with
data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of
interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132
radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using
Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were
implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The
diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices,
and ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately
implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the
calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the
Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a
training AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most
important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were
significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also
provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. DCA indicated a
higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies,
suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing
unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable
machine learning model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be
used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.

### [653] [AI Harmonizer: Expanding Vocal Expression with a Generative Neurosymbolic Music AI System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18143)
*Lancelot Blanchard,Cameron Holt,Joseph A. Paradiso*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI Harmonizer利用生成式AI技术，自动为独唱旋律生成四部和声，无需用户输入和声信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统和声生成工具需要用户具备音乐专业知识，限制了非专业用户的使用。AI Harmonizer旨在通过AI技术简化这一过程。

Method: 结合先进的音高检测、声音建模和符号音乐模型，系统自动生成和声。

Result: 系统成功生成了丰富的合唱纹理，适用于表演和作曲。

Conclusion: AI Harmonizer是AI辅助音乐表演的重要进展，未来将探索实时实现。

Abstract: Vocals harmonizers are powerful tools to help solo vocalists enrich their
melodies with harmonically supportive voices. These tools exist in various
forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,
each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers
often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others
allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some
degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by
autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without
requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art
generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with
custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into
rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential
applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for
real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we
believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance
and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.

users relieve their stress and anxiety. As such, it is a particularly
well-suited controller for musical systems that aim to help with emotion
regulation. In this regard, we present two different mappings for the MindCube,
with and without AI. With our generative AI mapping, we propose a way to infuse
meaning within a latent space and techniques to navigate through it with an
external controller. We discuss our results and propose directions for future
work.

TL;DR: PeepLoc是一种基于Wi-Fi的室内定位系统，利用现有设备和基础设施，无需修改硬件，适用于任何有足够Wi-Fi接入点和人流的环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有室内定位方法实用性不足，难以广泛部署。PeepLoc旨在提供一种可部署且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: PeepLoc通过非合作飞行时间（ToF）测量和基于行人航位推算（PDR）的众包机制，初始化Wi-Fi接入点为锚点。

Result: 在4个校园建筑中测试，PeepLoc的平均和中位定位误差分别为3.41米和3.06米，优于现有系统，接近室外GPS性能。

Conclusion: PeepLoc是一种高效、实用的室内定位解决方案，具有广泛部署潜力。

Abstract: Indoor localization opens the path to potentially transformative
applications. Although many indoor localization methods have been proposed over
the years, they remain too impractical for widespread deployment in the real
world. In this paper, we introduce PeepLoc, a deployable and scalable
Wi-Fi-based solution for indoor localization that relies only on pre-existing
devices and infrastructure. Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device
with an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a
sufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the
core of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain
non-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel
bootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and
crowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points
within an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and
evaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a
mean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is
superior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive
with commodity GPS in outdoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EEG控制假肢系统中的信号噪声、分类精度和实时适应性问题。

Method: 结合LSTM、CNN和随机森林的集成学习框架，预处理EEG信号（带通滤波、ICA、CSP），并集成语音识别实现模式切换。

Result: 分类准确率达96%，响应延迟150毫秒，适用于多用户和低功耗嵌入式部署。

Conclusion: BRAVE为非侵入式假肢控制提供了稳健、实时的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable
intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb
amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges
related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability.
In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic
system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness.
Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims
to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without
reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness,
BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework,
achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals
are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature
extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between
different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates
in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer
(LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on
an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting
the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power
embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond
high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers
a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.

TL;DR: 研究发现，人们在评估AI解释时，对概念泛化的识别能力有限，尤其是对不相关特征的泛化，可能导致负面评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们是否能识别并欣赏AI解释中的概念泛化，以判断AI是否真正理解复杂任务（如铁路安全评估）。

Method: 通过实验模拟铁路安全场景，参与者评估AI的危险判断，AI提供不同匹配度的图像片段作为解释概念。

Result: 参与者对不相关特征的泛化概念评价较低，但对相关特征的误差高度敏感。

Conclusion: 人们可能无法自发识别概念泛化，影响其对AI模型理解的判断。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) can help reveal the
inner representations of AI models. Understanding these representations is
particularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely
on high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions
about abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this
context, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,
suggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details
of a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate
such generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms
of imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety
scenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that
evaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain
these decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image
snippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,
either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less
relevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that
generalised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for
precisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically
misrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive
to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether
people spontaneously recognise generalisations. Accordingly, they might not be
able to infer from C-XAI concepts whether AI models have gained a deeper
understanding of complex situations.

Method: 采用PRISMA指导的范围综述方法，系统抽样、调查和综合2017-2025年的71篇相关文献。

Result: 文献中对MC的考虑差异较大，涉及理论、维度和测量变量（超过50种），最终提出MC的定义。

Conclusion: MC被定义为一种自主协调、主观积极且随时间发展的人机连接。

Abstract: The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in
social-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media
musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and
devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as "companions" yet
there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal
concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically
samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71;
2017-2025), to that end. Works varied widely in considerations of MC according
to guiding theories, dimensions of a-priori specified properties (subjectively
positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts
(with more than 50 distinct measured variables). WE ultimately offer a
literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection
between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive.

TL;DR: PaceLLM通过模拟大脑的工作记忆和皮层模块化，提出持久活动机制和皮层专家聚类，显著提升LLM的长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因神经激活短暂和FFN权重无序导致的信息衰减和语义碎片化问题。

Method: 引入持久活动机制动态管理FFN状态，并通过皮层专家聚类重组FFN权重为语义模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升6-17.5%，上下文长度扩展至20万token。

Conclusion: PaceLLM为脑启发的LLM优化提供了新思路，可推广至其他模型，无需结构大改。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across
domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural
activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network
(FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's
working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two
innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal
cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level
memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states,
addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that
emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into
semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating
fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement
on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on
Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens
in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM
optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be
generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and
interpretability without structural overhauls.

Conclusion: 通过神经机器翻译模型与人类记忆模型的结合，深化了对上下文功能的理解，并提供了新的记忆建模方法。

Abstract: Past work has long recognized the important role of context in guiding how
humans search their memory. While context-based memory models can explain many
memory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over
possible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that
foundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically,
recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention
-- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the
Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural
machine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their
convergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the
functional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to
model human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine
translation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both
interpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show
that our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns
as effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate
additional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search
performance emerges from the interaction of different model components.

Conclusion: KnoVo为研究者提供了一种量化新颖性和跟踪知识演化的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework
designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the
scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which
primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both
prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a
target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application,
dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these
same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament
selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative
improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific
aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for
instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo
facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar
work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions,
uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We
demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers
from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various
open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.

Conclusion: 机器学习在早期印刷书分析中具有潜力，但OCR性能和视觉内容解释仍需改进。

Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the
structure and content of incunabula pages. A custom dataset comprising 500
annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from
the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five
predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally,
the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training
data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and
trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom
dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was
achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical
character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using
both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results.
Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a
ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses:
Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection.
Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of
illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the
analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further
advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.

Motivation: 现有预测方法未充分利用酶催化的先验知识，导致与催化模式不符。OmniESI旨在通过渐进式特征调制解决这一问题。

Method: OmniESI采用两阶段条件网络，分别强调酶反应特异性和催化相关相互作用，实现从通用蛋白-分子域到催化感知域的渐进特征调制。

Result: 在七项基准测试中，OmniESI表现优于现有方法，且仅增加0.16%参数。条件网络成功内化催化效率模式。

Conclusion: OmniESI为酶-底物相互作用提供了统一预测框架，具有强泛化能力和广泛应用性。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for
catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering.
Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not
incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general
protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To
address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,
for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.
By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage
progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that
respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial
catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in
the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware
domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of
downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,
enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and
enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance
evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI
consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized
methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional
networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic
efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only
negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on
key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for
enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic
mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad
applicability.

Conclusion: AbRank为机器学习模型提供了泛化抗体-抗原空间的基础，对可扩展的抗体治疗设计有直接意义。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential
for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current
models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions,
and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We
introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that
reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates
over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse
antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized
data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local
perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel
antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an
m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal
affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold
difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we
introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein
language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise
binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current
methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that
ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary,
AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize
across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable,
structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

Motivation: 传统FS-KWS系统在低误接受率下准确率不足，尤其在边缘环境中表现不佳。

Method: 利用Wav2Vec 2.0作为教师模型，结合Sub-center ArcFace损失函数，并通过注意力降维和轻量级ResNet15学生模型实现高效部署。

Result: 在GSC数据集上，10-shot分类准确率从33.4%提升至74.1%，误接受率为1%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了FS-KWS的实用性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for
battery-powered edge devices. Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) addresses the
scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling
recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing
FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates,
particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these
issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning
models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge
distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using
Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and
intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we
introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard
lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google
Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves
the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1%
false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly
better-suited for a real use case scenario.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel unsupervised approach for separating
overlapping heart and lung sounds using variational autoencoders (VAEs). In
clinical settings, these sounds often interfere with each other, making manual
separation difficult and error-prone. The proposed model learns to encode mixed
signals into a structured latent space and reconstructs the individual
components using a probabilistic decoder, all without requiring labeled data or
prior knowledge of source characteristics. We apply this method to real
recordings obtained from a clinical manikin using a digital stethoscope.
Results demonstrate distinct latent clusters corresponding to heart and lung
sources, as well as accurate reconstructions that preserve key spectral
features of the original signals. The approach offers a robust and
interpretable solution for blind source separation and has potential
applications in portable diagnostic tools and intelligent stethoscope systems.

*Duong Bach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Co-Forgetting Protocol的新框架，用于在多智能体系统中同步修剪共享记忆，通过语义投票、时间衰减和PBFT共识机制实现高效管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中共享记忆同步和修剪的挑战，避免过时或无关数据的积累。

Method: 结合上下文感知语义投票、多尺度时间衰减函数和PBFT共识机制，利用DistilBERT、gRPC和Pinecone等技术实现。

Result: 实验显示，协议在500个周期内减少52%内存占用，遗忘决策准确率88%，PBFT共识成功率92%，缓存命中率82%。

Conclusion: Co-Forgetting Protocol有效解决了多智能体系统中的记忆管理问题，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic
environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared
knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain
synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or
inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper
introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework
designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in
MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic
voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the
relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational
context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing
importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different
time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based
consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items
are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in
the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N
greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient
inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage
and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations
in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's
efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%
voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a
92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an
82% cache hit rate for memory access.

### [669] [Distributed Butterfly Analysis using Mobile Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17721)
*Prabhat Kumar Chand,Apurba Das,Anisur Rahaman Molla*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理的分布式算法，用于计算二分图中的蝴蝶（4-循环），无需先验知识，仅需最高代理ID。方法包括领导者选举、生成树构建和高效的蝴蝶计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于代理的数据挖掘日益重要，但在二分图网络中的应用仍较少。蝴蝶结构对识别密集子图至关重要，因此需要高效的计算方法。

Method: 代理首先确定分区，协作构建生成树并选举领导者，利用相邻代理的新颖会面机制提高效率。算法扩展到一般图，保持相同的复杂度和内存需求。

Result: 算法在$O(n \log \lambda)$轮内完成领导者选举和生成树构建，蝴蝶计数在$O(\Delta)$轮内完成，总蝴蝶数计算在$O(\Delta+\min\{|A|,|B|\})$轮内完成。

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且通用，适用于二分图和一般图，为分布式蝴蝶计数提供了新思路。

Abstract: Butterflies, or 4-cycles in bipartite graphs, are crucial for identifying
cohesive structures and dense subgraphs. While agent-based data mining is
gaining prominence, its application to bipartite networks remains relatively
unexplored. We propose distributed, agent-based algorithms for \emph{Butterfly
Counting} in a bipartite graph $G((A,B),E)$. Agents first determine their
respective partitions and collaboratively construct a spanning tree, electing a
leader within $O(n \log \lambda)$ rounds using only $O(\log \lambda)$ bits per
agent. A novel meeting mechanism between adjacent agents improves efficiency
and eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the graph, requiring only the
highest agent ID $\lambda$ among the $n$ agents. Notably, our techniques
naturally extend to general graphs, where leader election and spanning tree
construction maintain the same round and memory complexities. Building on these
foundations, agents count butterflies per node in $O(\Delta)$ rounds and
compute the total butterfly count of $G$ in $O(\Delta+\min\{|A|,|B|\})$ rounds.

Abstract: Telerobotics is a key foundation in autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical
Systems (ICPS), enabling remote operations across various domains. However,
conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability,
scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical

highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and
AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies
that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge
Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel
has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while
supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges,
including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues,
and standardization efforts. This work serves as a foundational reference for
researchers, stakeholders, and industry practitioners in future telerobotics
research.

Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) technologies are foundational in
driving maritime autonomy, particularly for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs).
However, onboard computational constraints and communication latency
significantly restrict real-time data processing, analysis, and predictive
modeling, hence limiting the scalability and responsiveness of maritime ICPS.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a distributed Cloud-Edge-IoT
architecture tailored for maritime ICPS by leveraging design principles from
the recently proposed Cloud-Fog Automation paradigm. Our proposed architecture
comprises three hierarchical layers: a Cloud Layer for centralized and
decentralized data aggregation, advanced analytics, and future model
refinement; an Edge Layer that executes localized AI-driven processing and
decision-making; and an IoT Layer responsible for low-latency sensor data
acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrated improvements in
computational efficiency, responsiveness, and scalability. When compared with
our conventional approaches, we achieved a classification accuracy of 86\%,
with an improved latency performance. By adopting Cloud-Fog Automation, we
address the low-latency processing constraints and scalability challenges in
maritime ICPS applications. Our work offers a practical, modular, and scalable
framework to advance robust autonomy and AI-driven decision-making and autonomy
for intelligent USVs in future maritime ICPS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于张量的GPU加速方法，用于提升车辆路径问题（VRP）中局部搜索算子的计算效率，显著优于传统CPU实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 局部搜索在VRP及其变体中计算开销大，尤其在大型实例或复杂约束下耗时严重，需高效加速方法。

Method: 采用基于属性的张量表示和GPU加速，低耦合架构将密集计算完全卸载到GPU，适用于多种VRP变体。

Result: 在三种路径问题的基准实例上，该方法显著提升了计算效率，并可能改善解的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为局部搜索提供了高效加速，分析了其性能特点与潜在瓶颈，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for
the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood
exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming,
especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this
study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by
introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed
up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an
attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making
it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with
intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless
integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to
significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved
solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of
three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages
of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also
provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method,
providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and
identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings
contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future
improvements.

Conclusion: 论文为模型开发者和系统设计者提供了实用建议，如定制内核和SLO感知调度策略。

Abstract: The recent shift in Generative AI (GenAI) applications from cloud-only
environments to end-user devices introduces new challenges in resource
management, system efficiency, and user experience. This paper presents
ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the
system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user
devices. Unlike existing benchmarks that assume exclusive model access on
dedicated GPUs, ConsumerBench simulates realistic multi-application scenarios
executing concurrently on constrained hardware. Furthermore, ConsumerBench
supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring
coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both
application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO)
attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory
bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies
in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance
pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides
practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the
benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the
value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.

Conclusion: 论文讨论了不同并行策略的权衡，并展望了异构硬件集成和自动化调度技术的未来方向。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation
systems, the computational and communication bottlenecks caused by their
massive parameter sizes and large data volumes have become increasingly
prominent. This paper systematically investigates two classes of optimization
methods-model parallelism and data parallelism-for distributed training of LLMs
in recommendation scenarios. For model parallelism, we implement both tensor
parallelism and pipeline parallelism, and introduce an adaptive load-balancing
mechanism to reduce cross-device communication overhead. For data parallelism,
we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression
and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication
framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted
on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment
demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training
throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%
compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong
scalability and robustness. Finally, we discuss trade-offs among different
parallel strategies in online deployment and outline future directions
involving heterogeneous hardware integration and automated scheduling
technologies.

Conclusion: LLM代理在自主重现科学研究代码方面存在关键能力缺口。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in
advancing scientific discovery. However, their capability in the fundamental
yet crucial task of reproducing code from research papers, especially in the
NLP domain, remains underexplored. This task includes unique complex reasoning
challenges in the intellectual synthesis of abstract concepts and the
comprehension of code repositories with interdependent files. Motivated by this
gap, we present LMR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
capability of LLM agents on code reproduction from Language Modeling Research.
It consists of 28 code reproduction tasks derived from 23 research papers
published in top-tier NLP venues over the past five years, spanning nine
fundamental categories. Models are provided with a research paper, a code
repository containing one or more masked functions, and instructions for
implementing these functions. We conduct extensive experiments in standard
prompting and LLM agent settings with state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the
accuracy of unit tests and performing LLM-based evaluation of code correctness.
Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit
persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, highlighting
critical gaps in LLM agents' ability to autonomously reproduce scientific
research

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an
important research area in software engineering and are widely used by
practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific
code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step
in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing
code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are
prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could
result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations
of model capabilities.
  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental
designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt
sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that
modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and
their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct
extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative
open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt
templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical
metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings
suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in
performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce
inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These
insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing
future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM
capabilities.

Abstract: Software development is currently under a paradigm shift in which artificial
intelligence and generative software reuse are taking the center stage in
software creation. Consequently, earlier software reuse practices and methods
are rapidly being replaced by AI-assisted approaches in which developers place
their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is
leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that
different from cargo cult development. In this paper we discuss the
implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of
emerging "AI native" software engineering, bring forth relevant questions, and
define a tentative research agenda and call to action for tackling some of the
central issues associated with this approach.

TL;DR: GRAPHIA利用图神经网络改进JavaScript调用图构建，通过链接预测提高准确性，减少人工分析需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript调用图构建工具既不健全也不完整，存在误报和遗漏。GRAPHIA旨在通过机器学习方法改进这一问题。

Method: 将问题建模为全程序图上的链接预测，结合句法和语义边，利用图神经网络学习非局部关系。

Result: 在50个流行JavaScript库上评估，GRAPHIA在42%的情况下将正确目标排名第一，72%的情况下排名前五。

Conclusion: 基于学习的方法能显著提高调用图构建的召回率，GRAPHIA是首个将GNN应用于多文件程序图进行跨过程分析的工作。

Abstract: Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues.
A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model
function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,
existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound
nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges
and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed
call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full
program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our
approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model
non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose
representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and
semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static
call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the
same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine
learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by
ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a
large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges
(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M
structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top
candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,
reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that
learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph
construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link
prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.

Method: 在数据、模型、训练、系统和推理五个AI流程阶段进行策略性选择和组合优化。

Result: 实验验证显示，正交组合可减少94.6%的能耗，同时保留95.95%的原始F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法为可持续AI提供了可操作的框架，平衡效率、性能和环保责任。

Abstract: AI's exponential growth intensifies computational demands and energy
challenges. While practitioners employ various optimization techniques, that we
refer as "knobs" in this paper, to tune model efficiency, these are typically
afterthoughts and reactive ad-hoc changes applied in isolation without
understanding their combinatorial effects on energy efficiency. This paper
emphasizes on treating energy efficiency as the first-class citizen and as a
fundamental design consideration for a compute-intensive pipeline. We show that
strategic selection across five AI pipeline phases (data, model, training,
system, inference) creates cascading efficiency. Experimental validation shows
orthogonal combinations reduce energy consumption by up to $94.6$% while
preserving $95.95$% of the original F1 score of non-optimized pipelines. This
curated approach provides actionable frameworks for informed sustainable AI
that balance efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出Property-Generated Solver框架，利用基于属性的测试（PBT）替代传统测试驱动开发（TDD），通过两个LLM代理协作提升代码生成的正确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中表现优异，但确保其输出功能正确性仍具挑战性，尤其是复杂任务中。传统TDD因高质量测试用例稀缺或自动生成测试的缺陷（如偏见测试或不准确预测）而效果受限。

Method: 提出Property-Generated Solver框架，包含Generator（代码生成与迭代优化）和Tester（管理PBT生命周期并提供语义丰富的反馈）两个LLM代理，以PBT为核心验证机制。

Result: 在多个代码生成基准测试中，Property-Generated Solver的pass@1指标相对TDD方法提升23.1%至37.3%。

Conclusion: 通过PBT验证和LLM代理协作，框架显著提升了代码生成的正确性和泛化能力，为LLM代码生成提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their
outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is
a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers
a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the
scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test
generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can
misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated
Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to
validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on
specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define
and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the
"cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are
meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative
LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative
refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate
semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting
comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its
refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within
this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a
robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.
Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks
demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1
improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD
methods.

Result: DDI揭示了AI调试的根本限制，适时干预可显著提升调试效果。

Conclusion: DDI为优化迭代代码生成策略提供了首个量化框架。

Abstract: The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay
pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3
attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical
code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a
mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and
predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from
exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process,
demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of
debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and
provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code
generation strategies.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts,

their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these
agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their
operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale
empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three
state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent},
\textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs
into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions
focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative
analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with
qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We
identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token
consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking
thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and
anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing
actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies,
failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and
annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust
autonomous software engineering agents.

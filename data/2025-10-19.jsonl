However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI\ntechniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful\noutputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically\nrelevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by\npatients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is\nthe primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is\na translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a\nnovel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a\ncentral translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,\ntechnical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical\nguidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed\nclinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis\nof the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to\ngenerative XAI.

The method leverages self-training to\ngenerate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for\niterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.\nExperiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the\nCover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.\nAblation studies further validate the critical role of $\\varrho$'s dynamic\nscheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in\nreducing domain bias and improving generalization.

In this\nstudy, we establish an autonomous large language model (LLM)-driven microwell\ndesign framework to generate code-based computer-aided design (CAD) scripts,\nthat enables the rapid and reproducible creation of microwells with diverse\ngeometries and imaging-based analysis. We propose a multimodal large language\nmodel (MLLM)-logistic regression framework based on integrating high-level\nsemantic descriptions generated by MLLMs with image embeddings for image\nclassification tasks, aiming to identify microwell occupancy and microwell\nshape. The fused multimodal representation is input to a logistic regression\nmodel, which is both interpretable and computationally efficient.

Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot\nreact to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction\ncapabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned\ntraffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate\nplanners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift\nwhen narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and\nestablished baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates\nplanning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners\ninteract better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,\ninteraction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in\nclosed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,\nwhen reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned\nplanners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable\nbasic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a\nnew standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a\ndrop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop."}

The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously\ngrounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and\ndeployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems."}

In 100-persona experiments,\nscores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as\na benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several\nlightweight models rank lowest.

SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,\nresolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from\nthe world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,\nenabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.\nReal-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,\nexecuting tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,\nreaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further\ndemonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on\npoor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion\nby accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its\nflight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to\nimportant aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving\nextremely high-speed, agile flight."}

Additionally, they often fail to respond to\nthe user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This\nissue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs\nto model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without\ndirect supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a\nSpatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial\ncapabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object\nlocalization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image\nregions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and\nlocalization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and\nlocalization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM\ndescriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored\nrefinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct\npreference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual\ninput.

We focus on\nassessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern\nprofitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a\ncomprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's\nability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio\nselection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based\ntrading strategies."}

To study this question, we adopt an open-ended\nexperimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability\nto generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with\nits environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can\nreliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information\nacross runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive\nto prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form\nself-representations.

However, stringent requirements on computation time and\nthe risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based\nplanners in safety-critical scenarios.

We first demonstrate that\napplying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe\nperformance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we\npropose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters\ninto one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of\nholding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be\nrecovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a\nreconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.\nCrucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,\nrecognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized\nfor its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible\nModel Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides\na closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and\ntask-specific coefficients for linear combination.

This creates the risk of\nhallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.\nBuilding on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition\nrather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1\ncognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection\nor falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.\nInstead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations\nand the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically\naware AI deployment.

Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization.

In this paper,\nwe propose \\textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and\ntemporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating\nshot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions\nthat capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We\nalso introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning\ndataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.\nShot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a\nvisual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based\ndecoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we\nadditionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic\nunits, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic\ncaptioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where\nthe predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into\nthe decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables\nour system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to\ncapture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in\ngenerating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the\nResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that\nshot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic\ncaptioning."}

While recent advances in\ndynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by\nselectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on\ngreedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to\nirreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper\nintroduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these\nissues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance\nbut also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be\napproximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),\na small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing\ndecisions are made.

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi\nv3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9\npercent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while\nalso sharply reducing reward variance in both environments.

CoT-PL\ndecomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region\nperception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot\nreasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex\nobjects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive\nbackground learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as\nnegatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In\nthis way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust\npseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,\nour novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%\nand 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9\nmask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art."}

In\norder to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations\nbetween them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which\nwe also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed\nto leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently\ndistilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to\nmodels of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of\nreal-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity\nhardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same\nframework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation."}

To achieve this,\nwe analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged\nbetween PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across\nthree U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we\ngenerate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,\nClaude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and\nlearning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are\nfused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across\nmodels to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during\ninteraction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect\nand moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and\ncuriosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while\nless common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states\nare short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative\nones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted.

In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we\nchallenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for\nconvolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of\nthe hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the\nbest ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on\nseveral benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,\nreaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.\nSource code is available on\n\\href{https://github.com/munsifali11/CoLoR-GAN}{Github."}

Designed for\nscalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the\nsystem is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,\nand other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for\nmultilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and\nculturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation\ntime and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution\nof these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across\ndifferent NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that\nneed them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the\nprogram's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight\nguide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the\npublic. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental\nmultilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and\neducational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national\nwarning system that reaches all Americans."}

To train the model to use <don't know> outputs\njudiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each\noutput token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the\nclass of methods as $\\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three\nmethods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,\nwhere an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over\ntime; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction\naccuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP\nimposes a penalty based on a computational budget.

In this work, we address\nthis question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,\nfinding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this\nseparation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the\nmodel with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we\nintroduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.\nThrough extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial\ntriggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves\napproximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean\naccuracy.

However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient.

GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88\npercent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting,\nFew-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and\nscaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder\noutperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales.

SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by\nusers and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive\nenvironments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource\nrequirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a\nmulti-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously\nminimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC\nresources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective\nconsistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning\nand reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights.\nLeveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates\nPareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station\ndatasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and\nsignificantly lower inference latency than baseline methods.

In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of\nincreasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,\nmodels trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of\nwidely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.\nGiven that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an\ninteraction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates\nmoving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn\nreinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive\nbehaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned\nmodels."}

In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test.

To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization.

First, we\nintroduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,\nuser-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by\naveraging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the\ninstance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while\nremaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token\nspace with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the\nfirst frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB\n\\(+\\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors\nstructure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving\ntemporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts."}

This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating\nsafe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \\emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key\nattributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety\nconstraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in\ntraining. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be\ndeployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,\nwe demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned\npolicy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --\nenabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We\nvalidate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster\nconvergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid\nrobot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without\na runtime safety filter."}

Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning."}

Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a\ncross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to\ntarget domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying\nunbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In\nthis work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a\ncausality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR.

In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive\nexperiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that\nIGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,\nachieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency."}

This finetuning requires target task\ndemonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic\nrules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the\ntraining data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance.

We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens.

In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process.

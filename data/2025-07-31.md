### [1] [When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149)
*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过分析大语言模型（LLM）的内部表示，揭示了欺骗性指令如何改变模型行为，并提出了检测和缓解欺骗的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）容易受欺骗性指令影响生成虚假内容，但对其内部表示的变化机制尚不清楚。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAE）分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct模型在事实验证任务中的内部表示。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致显著的表示变化，主要集中在早期到中间层，且可通过SAE特征检测。还发现了特定敏感于欺骗性指令的特征。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和层级特征，为LLM的检测和控制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

### [2] [Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22197)
*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI的可解释性只是系统性理想的一部分，提出了系统性思想的四个维度，并分析了系统性对AI模型的要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究系统性思想在AI中的重要性，超越传统的可解释性，探讨系统性如何影响AI的理性、权威性和科学性。

Method: 提出系统性思想的四个维度，分析系统性对AI模型的要求，并探讨系统化的五个理由。

Result: 揭示了系统性对AI模型的更高要求，提出了“硬系统性挑战”，并指出系统化需求需要根据理由动态调整。

Conclusion: 系统性是AI模型的重要理想，但其需求应根据具体理由动态调整，以确定AI模型需要多系统化及何时需要。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

### [3] [CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22281)
*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层代理架构CoEx，通过动态更新世界模型解决现有LLM代理设计中静态世界模型导致的计划偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理设计无法动态更新世界模型，导致计划与真实世界状态脱节。

Method: 采用分层状态抽象，结合LLM推理和神经符号信念状态（文本推断与符号记忆），动态更新世界模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx在规划和探索方面优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型更新，显著提升了LLM代理的规划能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

### [4] [An Explainable Emotion Alignment Framework for LLM-Empowered Agent in Metaverse Service Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22326)
*Qun Ma,Xiao Xue,Ming Zhang,Yifan Shen,Zihan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的情感对齐框架，用于解决基于LLM的代理在元宇宙服务生态中面临的虚拟与现实服务融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，代理在元宇宙服务生态中扮演重要角色，但现有代理在虚拟与现实服务融合方面存在挑战，如数据融合、知识关联和伦理安全。

Method: 提出了一种可解释的情感对齐框架，将事实因素融入LLM代理的决策循环，实现更相关的事实对齐。

Result: 通过线下到线下食品配送场景的模拟实验，验证了框架的有效性，获得了更真实的社会涌现。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于LLM的代理在元宇宙服务生态中的虚拟与现实服务融合提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

### [5] [Magentic-UI: Towards Human-in-the-loop Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22358)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类监督与AI效率的人机协作系统Magentic-UI，通过六种交互机制提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在复杂任务中表现仍不及人类，且存在安全和风险问题，需要人类监督以提高性能和安全性。

Method: 开发了开源Web界面Magentic-UI，支持多工具扩展和六种交互机制（如共同规划和任务守卫）。

Result: 通过四项评估（任务完成、用户测试、定性研究和安全评估），验证了Magentic-UI在安全高效人机协作中的潜力。

Conclusion: Magentic-UI为安全高效的人机协作提供了可行路径，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

### [6] [LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359)
*Qianhong Guo,Wei Xie,Xiaofang Cai,Enze Wang,Shuoyoucheng Ma,Kai Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Baosheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LLM-Crowdsourced的无基准评估范式，通过LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，解决了现有评估方法的数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估LLM的真实能力。

Method: 采用LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估的范式，整合动态、透明、客观和专业四项关键评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程领域的八个主流LLM上验证了方法的优势，并发现了一些传统方法难以检测的新发现。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced方法能更全面、客观地评估LLM能力，并揭示传统方法难以捕捉的现象。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [7] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI的元认知敏感性（正确区分预测的能力）与预测准确性共同影响人类决策质量。研究发现，元认知敏感性高的AI即使预测准确性较低，也能提升人类决策表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性如何共同影响人类决策质量。

Method: 提出理论框架分析AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性的联合作用，并通过行为实验验证。

Result: 元认知敏感性高的AI能显著提升人类决策表现，即使其预测准确性较低。

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助时需同时考虑预测准确性和元认知敏感性，优化两者以实现更优决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

### [8] [On the Definition of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22423)
*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于样本保真度的通用智能标准，认为智能是能够根据类别样本生成同类样本的能力，并形式化为ε-类别智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了构建通用人工智能（AGI），需要一种物种无关的智能定义，能够涵盖多种智能行为范式。

Method: 提出ε-类别智能框架，通过样本生成能力定义智能，并设计实验协议验证。

Result: 形式化框架和实验协议为智能评估、安全性和泛化提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该标准为AGI的工程化提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶汽车跨国应用中的法律合规问题，帮助设计者在设计过程中更好地理解法律影响。

Method: 基于论证理论，引入逻辑表示论证性实践（规范性）推理的基本属性，结合自然数的偏序集表达优先级。

Result: 通过法律文本的案例分析，展示了提供的推理系统如何帮助设计者更灵活地调整设计方案，并更容易理解决策的法律含义。

Conclusion: 提出的推理系统为自动驾驶汽车跨国应用中的法律合规提供了实用工具，增强了设计者对法律问题的适应性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的NBN计算方法，并揭示了OneMax和TSP问题的景观特征，同时指出了EAX和LKH算法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NBN计算耗时问题，并将其扩展到组合优化问题，以分析算法行为。

Method: 通过理论推导证明NBN作为最大概率转移网络，并提出对数线性时间复杂度的NBN计算方法。

Result: 发现OneMax的景观具有中性、崎岖和多模态特征；TSP的主要挑战是崎岖性、多模态和欺骗性；EAX和LKH算法在多模态和欺骗性方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 高效的NBN计算方法成功应用于组合优化问题，揭示了算法行为的关键特征，并指出了现有算法的改进方向。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

*Hongyan Cheng,Chengzhang Yu,Yanshu Shi,Chiyue Wang,Cong Liu,Zhanpeng Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体交互式医疗分诊系统，解决了当前AI分诊系统中的医疗专业化不足、机构异构性和低效提问问题，实验显示高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情后医疗需求激增和护士短缺，急需AI驱动的创新分诊解决方案。

Method: 采用三种专业智能体（RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent、DepartmentAgent）协作，通过结构化提问和部门规则实现准确分诊。

Result: 系统在四次交互后，主科室分类准确率达89.2%，次科室达73.9%。

Conclusion: 该系统为医疗机构的异构性提供了可扩展的AI分诊框架，确保临床决策的准确性。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

TL;DR: MetaAgent是一个基于有限状态机的框架，能自动生成多智能体系统，优化后性能优于其他自动设计方法，接近人工设计系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工设计多智能体框架局限于预定义场景，自动设计方法存在工具集成不足、依赖外部数据、通信结构僵化等问题。

Method: 提出MetaAgent框架，通过任务描述自动生成多智能体系统，并利用优化算法优化；部署时由有限状态机控制智能体行为和状态转换。

Result: 实验表明，生成的多智能体系统优于其他自动设计方法，性能接近人工优化系统。

Conclusion: MetaAgent为解决多智能体系统自动设计问题提供了有效方案，性能优越且灵活。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

*Sebastian Monka,Irlan Grangel-González,Stefan Schmid,Lavdim Halilaj,Marc Rickart,Oliver Rudolph,Rui Dias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询，以简化知识图谱（KGs）在制造业中的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在制造业中整合数据非常有效，但非专家用户难以通过复杂SPARQL查询获取信息。LLMs的潜力可以解决这一问题。

Method: 评估了多种策略，利用LLMs作为中介，将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询，并比较了不同上下文提示方法的效果。

Result: 研究发现，提供适当的KG上下文可以显著提高LLMs生成正确和完整查询的能力，减少幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知提示技术有望简化复杂数据存储库的访问，支持制造业中的决策制定。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展ASP以支持线性约束，提供更丰富的约束语言，并提升求解效率。

Method: 将CASP程序翻译为FlatZinc语言，利用多种后端求解器（如约束规划和整数规划）进行求解。

Result: asp-fzn在ASP竞赛基准测试中表现优异，且在部分CASP问题上超越现有求解器clingcon。

Conclusion: asp-fzn在ASP和CASP问题上均表现出竞争力，性能优越，具有潜力。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

### [17] [Automatically discovering heuristics in a complex SAT solver with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22876)
*Yiwen Sun,Furong Ye,Zhihan Chen,Ke Wei,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）优化SAT求解器的新方法，开发了工具AutoModSAT，解决了三个关键挑战，实验表明其性能显著优于基线及SOTA求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在复杂架构下难以优化，现有自动配置框架依赖手动约束且性能提升有限。

Method: 1. 设计LLM友好的模块化解器；2. 提出自动提示优化方法；3. 开发高效的搜索策略（预搜索和进化算法）。

Result: AutoModSAT性能提升50%，优于SOTA求解器30%，速度提升20%。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了AI驱动启发式发现与关键系统优化间的空白，为下一代复杂求解器开发提供了方法论和实证结果。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个完全由人工编写的印尼语偏好数据集IndoPref，用于评估大语言模型生成文本的自然性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼语在基于偏好的大语言模型研究中代表性不足，现有数据集多来自英语翻译，缺乏文化和语言真实性。

Method: 创建IndoPref数据集，所有标注均为印尼语原生撰写，并使用Krippendorff's alpha评估标注者间一致性。

Result: 数据集展示了较强的标注者间一致性，并对多个大语言模型进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: IndoPref填补了印尼语偏好数据集的空白，为评估大语言模型提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前评估大语言模型（LLM）的基准测试缺乏写作风格多样性，可能导致模型在非标准输入下表现不稳定。本研究通过基于角色的提示改写方法，验证了写作风格和提示格式对LLM性能评估的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分反映人类沟通的多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现不佳。

Method: 使用基于角色的LLM提示改写方法，模拟多样化的写作风格。

Result: 研究发现，即使语义内容相同，写作风格和提示格式的变化也会显著影响LLM的性能评估。某些写作风格会持续引发低或高性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种可扩展的方法，通过增强基准测试的外部有效性，更全面地评估LLM在语言变体中的表现。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化流程，利用大语言模型（LLMs）估计动词框架频率（VFFs），优于现有工具，并生成更全面的VFF数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上有限，无法满足研究需求。

Method: 使用LLMs生成句子语料库，并指导LLM像语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于两种广泛使用的句法分析器，且资源消耗远低于人工分析。

Conclusion: 该流程为自动化框架频率估计提供了概念验证，并支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Traits Run Deep的人格评估框架，通过心理学提示和多模态融合技术，显著提升了人格评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉跨模态的异步信号和深层语义。

Method: 采用心理学提示引导大型语言模型提取人格语义，设计文本中心的多模态融合网络，包括降维、跨模态连接和特征增强模块。

Result: 在AVI验证集上MSE降低约45%，在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: Traits Run Deep框架通过多模态融合和心理学提示显著提升了人格评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

*L. Toschi,S. Torrisi,A. Fronzetti Colladon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 媒体记忆性（媒体内容对投资者记忆的影响）显著影响风险投资决策，初创企业应通过突出独特性和行业相关性来增强品牌记忆性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注媒体曝光度，忽视了媒体内容对投资决策的细微影响，因此提出媒体记忆性概念以填补这一空白。

Method: 分析了197家英国微纳米技术领域初创企业（1995-2004年）的数据，研究媒体记忆性对投资结果的影响。

Result: 媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果，风险投资者关注初创企业的独特性和新闻语义网络中的连接性。

Conclusion: 初创企业应通过更有针对性的媒体报道来增强品牌记忆性，而不仅仅是追求频繁曝光。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言模型的首个子词标记估计上下文熵会低估和扭曲真实熵，提出蒙特卡洛估计方法，实验显示两种方法结果不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨上下文熵作为心理语言学指标的准确性，避免首个子词标记估计的偏差。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛方法估计单词熵，允许单词跨越多个标记，并与首个子词标记估计对比。

Result: 回归实验显示首个子词标记和蒙特卡洛估计的单词熵结果存在差异。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用首个子词标记近似估计上下文熵，蒙特卡洛方法更准确。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面试表现评估对职业岗位的候选人筛选至关重要，但传统方法可能不够全面或公平。

Method: 采用多模态特征提取器编码数据，通过共享压缩多层感知机融合特征，并使用两级集成学习策略增强预测鲁棒性。

Result: 在多维平均MSE为0.1824的情况下，该框架在AVI Challenge 2025中排名第一。

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉显性和隐性线索，实现了全面且无偏的面试表现评估，展示了其在自动化多模态评估中的有效性。

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习框架，通过外部教师模型（GPT-4o）提供连续反馈，替代静态三元组数据，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖静态三元组数据且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈提升翻译效果。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程，演员生成假设，教师模型优化，演员根据与优化结果的匹配度获得奖励。使用负编辑距离和COMET分数作为信号。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义充分性和实体保留方面优于MT-SFT和基于偏好的基线方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和渐进学习显著提升机器翻译性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否能够学习到功能驱动的、梯度性的构式表征。

Method: 分析Pythia-1.4B模型中对英语双宾语和介词宾语构式的神经表征，使用5000对句子数据集，通过几何方法（如能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度）测量表征的可分性。

Result: 构式表征的可分性受梯度偏好强度调节，更典型的构式实例在激活空间中占据更独特的区域。

Conclusion: LLMs能够学习到丰富的、功能驱动的梯度构式表征，支持几何方法验证构式理论。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上评估，发现共享BERT输出信息给LLM能提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在意图识别和OOS检测中表现优越，尤其在数据稀缺场景下。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

Motivation: 现有NIAH基准可能无法准确评估LLMs的真实长上下文理解能力，需要更全面的测试方法。

Method: 提出NeedleChain基准，上下文全为查询相关信息，并引入ROPE Contraction策略。

Result: 实验显示先进LLMs（如GPT-4o）在完全理解长上下文方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction为评估和提升LLMs的长上下文理解能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code

*Jill Walker Rettberg,Hermann Wigers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于英美文本训练的语言模型生成的故事在文化多样性上表现不足，呈现出叙事同质化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能生成具有文化多样性的故事。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和主题。

Result: 故事普遍遵循单一叙事结构，缺乏文化深度和冲突，偏向传统与稳定。

Conclusion: AI生成的叙事同质化是一种新型偏见，需在文化对齐研究中加以关注。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

TL;DR: Falcon-H1是一种新型混合架构大语言模型系列，结合Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM），在性能和效率上表现优异，支持多语言和长上下文任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过混合架构设计，提升模型在长上下文记忆和计算效率上的表现，同时挑战传统模型设计方法。

Method: 采用Transformer与状态空间模型（SSM）的并行混合架构，优化模型设计、数据策略和训练动态。

Result: Falcon-H1系列模型在多个规模上表现优异，如34B模型性能媲美70B规模模型，且参数和训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Falcon-H1系列模型在性能、效率和适用性上均达到领先水平，并通过开源许可推动AI研究的可及性。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

TL;DR: LLMs在零样本设置下表现不佳，但通过微调输入编码参数可实现接近完美的性能，但泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否具备抽象推理能力，重新定义“抽象推理”的意义。

Method: 在零样本和微调设置下测试LLMs性能，并分析泛化能力。

Result: 微调显著提升性能，但无法跨数据集泛化。

Conclusion: 需要重新讨论LLMs的抽象推理能力及其重要性。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

Motivation: 现实应用中，代码生成不仅需要正确性，还需严格遵循编码风格、行数和结构约束等详细要求。

Method: 采用前向和后向约束生成方法，增强模型在可控代码生成中的指令遵循能力。

Result: 实验表明，闭源模型在可控代码生成上优于开源模型，且模型生成正确代码与精确遵循指令之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 论文为代码大语言模型的可控生成提供了新方法，并通过IFEvalCode基准揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署上有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳，因此研究如何通过后训练技术提升其性能。

Method: 利用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建两个衍生数据集，采用监督微调和基于强化学习的后训练，并结合自一致性推理方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLM-SQL方法在BIRD开发集上平均提升31.4分，0.5B和1.5B模型的执行准确率分别达到56.87%和67.08%。

Conclusion: SLM-SQL方法有效提升了小语言模型在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，具有推广潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理长文本、多语言电子健康记录时的局限性，以及临床幻觉和评估指标不可靠的问题。

Method: 将非结构化的纵向电子健康记录转化为患者特定的时间知识图谱，并与规范性指南知识图谱对齐。

Result: CliCARE在中文和英文数据集上显著优于基线模型，临床有效性得到专家认可。

Conclusion: CliCARE为临床决策支持提供了高效、可靠的方法，有望减少医生负担并提升患者护理质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Result: 揭示了模型的优势、劣势和语言模式，为下一代ViLLMs的开发提供了改进方向。

Conclusion: 通过建立基准数据集和系统评估，支持越南语LLMs的研究，并帮助企业选择适合的模型。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策的生命关键性需要可靠的模型支持，但现有推理LLM因冗长的推理过程导致计算开销和延迟，限制了实际应用。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）预训练大规模合成医疗指令数据集；2）监督微调多长度推理数据；3）强化学习提升准确性和质量。

Result: 实验显示ControlMed在英语和韩语医疗基准测试中性能优于或接近现有最佳模型，并能灵活平衡准确性和效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是临床问答和医疗信息分析的实用且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

Result: 在30种LLM中成功率高（60.1% vs. 31.6%），开源模型尤其脆弱。

Conclusion: 多偏见交互是未充分探索的攻击方向，为更鲁棒的AI安全机制提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在放大情况下的作用，尤其是在多语言模型中对低资源语言的影响。

Method: 通过干预18种语言（包括低资源语言）的语言特定神经元，提出语言转向偏移（LSS）评分，并在下游任务（如常识推理、知识、翻译）中评估效果。

Result: 最优放大因子能有效将输出转向目标语言，但在下游任务中，对自身语言性能有提升，跨语言性能普遍下降。

Conclusion: 语言特定神经元的放大对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Result: BALSAM为阿拉伯语LLM提供了统一标准和协作研究平台。

Conclusion: BALSAM有望推动阿拉伯语LLM的发展与评估。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: 语言特异性神经元的操纵能有效指导模型行为，且跨语言神经元调控可提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available

Method: 评估7个模型在14种语言中的政治倾向，使用政治罗盘测试和语义等效改写，并测试干预技术。

Result: 较大模型普遍倾向自由左翼立场，语言和模型家族间存在显著差异，干预技术可有效操控政治立场。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可操控性，为未来研究和应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Motivation: 现有RAG方法仅依赖最终答案奖励，忽视了中间推理质量，导致推理能力不足。

Result: 在四个多跳QA数据集上表现优于现有RAG方法，并能泛化到单跳任务。

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1显著提升了RAG模型的推理能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

Motivation: 提升LLM在多语言中的可靠性，解决幻觉问题。

Method: 分析GPT-3.5、GPT-4o等模型在印地语、波斯语和汉语中的事实和语言错误。

Result: 汉语幻觉较少，印地语和波斯语幻觉较多。

Conclusion: 需针对不同语言优化LLM以减少幻觉。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过聚合技术、提示工程和对比微调，将预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）有效适配为文本嵌入模型，在MTEB基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成中表现优异，但其向量聚合为文本嵌入时会丢失关键信息，而许多非生成任务（如聚类、分类）需要准确的句子或文档级嵌入。

Method: 采用三种策略：(i) 词嵌入聚合技术，(ii) 任务特定提示工程，(iii) 通过对比微调进行文本级增强。

Result: 在MTEB的英文聚类任务中达到最优性能，注意力图分析显示微调后模型更关注语义相关词。

Conclusion: LLMs可通过提示工程和资源高效的对比微调有效适配为文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and

However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we

employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化表示方法TaSoF和框架SPaGe，用于解决查询聚焦表摘要中自然语言计划的模糊性和可扩展性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划在查询聚焦表摘要中存在模糊性和缺乏结构的问题，限制了其转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力，尤其是在多表任务中。

Method: 提出了结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，包括三个阶段：结构化规划生成TaSoF，基于图的执行转换为SQL并建模依赖关系，以及摘要生成。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表设置下均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示显著提高了查询聚焦表摘要的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中上下文学习（ICL）的位置偏差（DPP），发现演示（demos）在输入中的位置显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL中未被研究的位置偏差，揭示其对模型预测和准确性的影响。

Method: 设计系统性评估流程，引入ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE指标，在分类、问答、摘要和推理任务中测试十种LLMs。

Result: 演示位置对模型性能影响显著，开头放置演示最稳定，准确率提升高达6分；末尾放置则导致30%预测反转。

Conclusion: DPP偏差普遍存在，小型模型受影响最大，但大型模型在复杂任务中仍受轻微影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类颜色感知机制，显著提升了少样本分类性能。

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

Motivation: 儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）的诊断和治疗存在挑战，深度学习分割技术有望提供帮助，但其在异质性PBT亚型和MRI协议中的性能尚不明确。

Method: 使用174名儿童患者的MRI数据（T1、T1-C、T2、FLAIR），训练3D nnU-Net模型，评估其在四种肿瘤子区域的分割性能。

Result: 模型在整体肿瘤和T2高信号区域表现稳健（DSC: 0.85），与人工标注相当（DSC: 0.86），但增强肿瘤和囊性成分分割较差。

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg为无人监督地形分割提供了时间一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法SmartCLIP，解决了CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中的信息错位和表示纠缠问题，通过模块化方式实现多粒度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中存在信息错位和表示纠缠问题，限制了其在短提示任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出理论条件，支持多粒度对齐，并引入SmartCLIP方法，模块化对齐最相关的视觉和文本表示。

Result: SmartCLIP在多种任务中表现优异，验证了其处理信息错位的能力。

Conclusion: SmartCLIP通过模块化对齐解决了CLIP的局限性，提升了多粒度对齐能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工，耗时且资源密集，需要自动化且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 提出HOG-CNN模型，融合手工HOG特征和CNN特征，捕捉局部纹理和高层语义特征。

Result: 在APTOS 2019、ORIGA和IC-AMD数据集上表现优异，如98.5%准确率（二元DR分类）和94.8%精确度（AMD诊断）。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是一种轻量级、可解释且高效的自动化视网膜疾病筛查工具，适合资源受限的临床环境。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a

Result: LAMA-Net表现出优异的稳定性和鲁棒性，iLAMA-Net进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net在稀疏视图CT重建中优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作域适应（CDA）框架，结合Vision Transformer和CNN，用于基于T1加权MRI的晚年抑郁症（LLD）检测，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的LLD检测方法因样本量小和域异质性（如成像协议、硬件和人口统计差异）而受限，需提升跨域泛化能力。

Method: 采用ViT和CNN双分支结构，分三阶段训练：源数据监督训练、目标特征自监督适应和协作训练（利用伪标签和增强数据）。

Result: 在多站点T1加权MRI数据上的实验表明，CDA在无监督域适应方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: CDA框架有效解决了LLD检测中的域异质性问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设输入视角为有利视角，限制了在真实场景中的应用。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 采用低秩适应层（LoRA）和提出的高斯适配模块，结合高斯对齐方法，利用有利图像数据集进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了该方法在处理不利视角时的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在不利输入视角下的表现，扩展了其实际应用范围。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Result: DeltaVLM在单轮描述和多轮交互分析中表现最优。

Conclusion: DeltaVLM为遥感图像变化分析提供了高效的多模态交互解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

Result: FaceGCD在GFD任务上显著优于现有GCD方法和ArcFace基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceGCD为开放世界人脸识别提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with

We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video

ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our

Motivation: 理解多人在社交场景中的情绪（个体、群体和事件层面）需要更细粒度和全面的分析，现有基准测试主要关注群体层面的情绪感知。

Method: 采用多模态Swin-Transformer和S3Attention架构，结合场景、群体成员和上下文信息，预测离散和连续情绪（包括效价和唤醒度）。

Result: 在VGAF-GEMS基准测试中，GEMS框架在定量和定性比较中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEMS为多人在社交场景中的情绪分析提供了更全面的解决方案，并推动了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

*Jordan Vice,Naveed Akhtar,Yansong Gao,Richard Hartley,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在频率域的细微扰动下表现脆弱，影响其真实性检测和图像描述能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在频率域扰动下的脆弱性，挑战其在真实场景中的可靠性。

Method: 设计频率域的目标图像变换，测试五种先进VLMs在十种数据集上的表现。

Result: VLMs对频率扰动敏感，输出与语义内容不完全一致，且扰动在视觉上难以察觉。

Conclusion: VLMs的可靠性受到挑战，需开发更鲁棒的多模态感知系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

*Sua Lee,Joonhun Lee,Myungjoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR框架结合隐式神经表示与掩码图像建模，提升自监督学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于MAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAE在掩码策略和分布外数据上性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出MINR框架，利用隐式神经表示学习图像的连续函数表示。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景中均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MZNet网络，通过多尺度双注意力块、多形状大核卷积块和特征融合跳跃连接，有效去除图像中的摩尔纹，达到摩尔纹零状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摩尔纹在摄影和工业检测中造成问题，现有CNN方法因感受野受限难以有效去除。

Method: 设计U形网络MZNet，包含多尺度双注意力块、多形状大核卷积块和特征融合跳跃连接。

Result: 在高低分辨率数据集上均表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: MZNet是高效实用的摩尔纹去除解决方案。

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

TL;DR: UAVScenes是一个多模态无人机数据集，旨在解决现有数据集在高级场景理解任务中的局限性，提供帧级标注和6-DoF位姿，支持多种感知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机数据集多偏向定位和3D重建任务，缺乏帧级标注，限制了其在高级场景理解任务中的应用。

Method: 基于MARS-LVIG数据集，通过手动标注图像和LiDAR点云的语义信息，并添加6-DoF位姿，构建UAVScenes数据集。

Result: UAVScenes支持分割、深度估计、6-DoF定位、地点识别和新视角合成等多种任务。

Conclusion: UAVScenes填补了多模态无人机数据集的空白，为高级场景理解任务提供了基准。

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件流匹配的方法，用于医学图像分割中的不确定性量化，优于现有生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中的不确定性（如专家标注的变异性）需要准确量化，现有生成模型表达能力有限。

Method: 利用条件流匹配（一种无模拟的流生成模型）学习精确密度，通过输入图像引导生成多个分割样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅分割精度高，还能生成反映数据分布的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉边界模糊区域的不确定性，提供更可靠的量化结果。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用LVLMs提升图像-文本对数据的质量，形成自我强化的循环，以持续改进模型性能。

Method: 引入LVLM驱动的数据精炼流程，生成四种互补的文本标注，并基于此提出扩展对比学习的训练范式。

Conclusion: 通过LVLM驱动的数据精炼和扩展训练范式，显著提升了模型性能，为数据质量和模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

*Youngho Kim,Hoonhee Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用事件相机进行领域适应的新方法，以解决运动模糊下人体姿态估计的问题，无需目标域标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊和低光条件导致传统姿态估计方法性能下降，现有数据集假设稳定条件，无法适应模糊环境。

Method: 结合事件相机的高时间分辨率数据，通过事件增强生成运动模糊图像，并采用师生框架迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动模糊环境下优于传统领域适应方法，无需目标域标注。

Conclusion: 事件相机为现实运动模糊环境中的领域适应提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LiDAR生成方法在几何细节和全局拓扑一致性上的不足。

Conclusion: TopoLiDM在LiDAR生成中实现了高保真度和高效性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有任务驱动图像恢复方法难以处理多复杂退化图像的问题，并探索如何有效利用扩散先验恢复任务相关细节。

Method: 提出EDTR方法，通过从像素误差预恢复的低质量图像生成扩散过程，并限制去噪步骤以避免冗余细节。

Result: EDTR在多复杂退化任务中显著提升了任务性能和视觉质量。

Conclusion: EDTR有效利用扩散先验，为任务驱动图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

Conclusion: HMHI-Net通过结合像素和语义信息，解决了UVOS中的关键问题，表现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中优于传统分类器，展示了零样本方法的潜力。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有方法（如基于单应性或网格流的技术）在复杂非线性变换或非平面场景中表现不佳，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: CamFlow结合物理基（相机几何）和随机基（复杂场景），使用基于拉普拉斯分布的混合概率损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: CamFlow通过混合运动基和新型损失函数，为2D相机运动估计提供了更通用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有All-in-One模型难以捕捉多样化和局部化的天气退化模式，尤其是频率域全局滤波方法的局限性。

Method: SSGformer通过频谱分解（边缘检测和SVD）提取高低频特征，利用多头线性注意力建模特征关系，生成分组掩码，并引入分组注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，SSGformer在多样化天气退化处理上表现优越。

Conclusion: SSGformer通过频谱分解和分组注意力，有效解决了复杂天气条件下的图像恢复问题。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The
source code and dataset will be publicly available at

Result: 在图像分类和视频动作识别任务中，平均性能提升9.07%和7.40%。

Conclusion: 提示演化机制有效提升了持续学习中提示的多样性和任务适应性。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Method: 采用双阶段框架，结合强化学习自适应采样器动态调整合成与真实数据比例，并使用类可控合成网络保持类别特征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了数据分布偏差，提升了分类性能，为乳腺病变识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 解决OOD检测性能受限于单一分类器能力的问题，通过集成不同分类器的优势。

Method: 创建异构集成COOkeD，结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的OOD检测性能和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过简单且模块化的方法显著提升了OOD检测性能，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Method: 利用轨迹保留的少步扩散模型构建更短的去噪链，优化效率。

Result: 方法显著提升对齐性能，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: ShortFT是一种高效微调策略，适用于多种奖励函数。

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: PCuRL框架有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: GALTraj首次展示了模拟驱动的增强如何有效改善轨迹预测中的长尾学习，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Abstract: Leaf wetness detection is a crucial task in agricultural monitoring, as it
directly impacts the prediction and protection of plant diseases. However,
existing sensing systems suffer from limitations in robustness, accuracy, and
environmental resilience when applied to natural leaves under dynamic
real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce a new
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for evaluating and advancing machine
learning algorithms in leaf wetness detection. Our dataset comprises
synchronized mmWave raw data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and RGB
images collected over six months from five diverse plant species in both
controlled and outdoor field environments. We provide detailed benchmarks using
the Hydra model, including comparisons against single modality baselines and
multiple fusion strategies, as well as performance under varying scan
distances. Additionally, our dataset can serve as a benchmark for future SAR
imaging algorithm optimization, enabling a systematic evaluation of detection
accuracy under diverse conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的OOD检测方法，利用去噪轨迹和Stein分数误差进行语义异常检测，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中部署安全的视觉系统需要检测OOD输入，扩散模型作为通用感知模板为此提供了新思路。

Method: 利用Denoising Diffusion Models（DDMs）的去噪轨迹和Stein分数误差，结合SSIM指标，检测异常样本。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上训练的单一模型表现优异，甚至优于ImageNet，部分基准测试接近完美性能。

Conclusion: 生成基础模型在异常检测中具有强大潜力，未来有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

### [107] [Image-Guided Shape-from-Template Using Mesh Inextensibility Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22699)
*Thuy Tran,Ruochen Chen,Shaifali Parashar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督的Shape-from-Template（SfT）方法，仅使用图像观测（颜色特征、梯度和轮廓）和网格不可扩展性约束，以比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍的速度重建3D形状，并在细节和严重遮挡情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfT方法需要图像与3D模板的点对应关系，性能在严重遮挡时下降；现代方法依赖大量监督数据。本文旨在开发一种无需对应关系且无监督的高效方法。

Method: 结合颜色特征、梯度和轮廓等图像观测，以及网格不可扩展性约束，实现无监督3D形状重建。

Result: 方法比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍，且在细节和严重遮挡情况下表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督SfT方法高效且鲁棒，适用于复杂场景，代码已开源。

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Conclusion: 利用人体姿态信息可以显著提升轨迹预测的准确性，且`Social-pose`具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection
increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection
techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level
Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by
the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale
audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level
deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples,
thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features
an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual
interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under
the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware
cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised
singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive
experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation
studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components.
Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the
TestA set.

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for
applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and
SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching,
exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth
images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language
interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and
descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate
intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language
tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly
diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Motivation: 解决低收入国家因缺乏专业超声医师而难以获取高质量胎儿超声图像的问题。

Method: 基于FetalCLIP模型，采用LoRA微调技术开发FetalCLIP_CLS模型，并在ACOUSLIC-AI数据集上与多种基线模型对比。

Result: FetalCLIP_CLS在F1分数上表现最佳（0.757），改进后的分割模型进一步将F1分数提升至0.771。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术可适配胎儿超声基础模型，推动资源有限地区的产前护理发展。

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型在复杂视觉信息处理和跨模态桥接上存在高成本和效率问题。

Method: 整合CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt四种视觉骨干网络，采用稀疏专家混合模块（MoECs）和分层组注意力（HGA）优化视觉特征提取。

Result: MoCHA在多个基准测试中表现优异，优于当前最优模型，如在POPE上提升3.25%，MME上提升153分。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块显著提升了性能，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受特洛伊木马攻击，现有触发器反演方法缺乏对触发器真实性的保证。

Method: 使用扩散生成器在目标分类器引导下迭代生成候选触发器，避免对触发器外观的强假设。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上准确率提升7.1%，在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提升9.4%。

Conclusion: DISTIL为无需大量数据或强先验假设的可靠后门防御提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效提升了AI生成人脸检测的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用深度信息的几何信息，仅用于推理阶段的对象布局估计。DepR旨在通过深度引导的训练和推理，提升重建质量。

Method: DepR采用深度引导条件化，将形状先验编码到扩散模型中，并在推理阶段通过DDIM采样和布局优化增强对齐。

Result: DepR在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，实现了最先进的性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DepR通过深度信息的充分利用，显著提升了单视角场景重建的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Method: 采用三阶段框架：grounding代理使用视觉语言模型标记UI组件，planning代理构建层次化布局，generation代理通过自适应提示生成HTML/CSS代码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在布局准确性、结构连贯性和代码正确性上达到SOTA性能，并通过合成数据微调模型进一步提升了效果。

Conclusion: 该框架在UI到代码的转换中表现出更高的鲁棒性、可解释性和保真度，且开源代码可供使用。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available

### [120] [CapRecover: A Cross-Modality Feature Inversion Attack Framework on Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22828)
*Kedong Xiu,Saiqian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRecover是一种跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征恢复高级语义内容（如标签或标题），避免图像重建，解决视觉语言模型中的语义信息泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分体式DNN配置中的部署增加，中间特征的语义信息泄漏风险上升，现有图像重建方法效果模糊且语义不明确。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，并通过实验验证其性能。同时，提出一种简单保护方法：在每层添加随机噪声并在下一层去除。

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上生成流畅标题（ROUGE-L得分0.52）。保护方法有效防止语义泄漏。

Conclusion: CapRecover能高效恢复语义内容，提出的噪声保护方法简单有效，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TR-PTS是一种任务驱动的参数和令牌选择框架，通过优化参数和令牌选择提升计算效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有参数高效微调方法任务无关性导致的效率和性能不足问题。

Method: 利用Fisher信息矩阵选择关键参数，动态合并冗余令牌，联合优化参数和令牌。

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB-1k上超越全微调3.40%和10.35%。

Conclusion: TR-PTS显著提升任务相关性和性能，适用于高效视觉任务微调。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Method: 利用对抗训练从低分辨率到高分辨率图像对（GameIR）训练LCS，并结合重参数化和量化技术降低模型复杂度。

Result: LCS在五项指标上优于AMD的EASF和FSR1，表现出更好的感知质量。

Conclusion: LCS展示了高效超分辨率模型在资源受限设备上的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on
other related tasks.

TL;DR: CIMR框架通过上下文感知的迭代推理和自我修正模块，显著提升了多模态复杂任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言和视觉语言模型在复杂多模态指令中的逻辑推理和动态反馈整合不足问题。

Method: 提出CIMR框架，分两阶段：初始推理和迭代细化，结合动态融合模块整合多模态特征。

Result: 在MAP数据集上达到91.5%准确率，优于GPT-4V等现有模型。

Conclusion: CIMR的迭代推理和自我修正能力在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督适应中，伪标签常因噪声问题表现不佳，传统固定阈值方法不可靠，需更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 结合PICS（基于类内紧凑性和类间分离性评估伪标签准确性）和NALR（利用邻域样本语义相似性动态优化伪标签），并引入自适应权重机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，提供更准确的伪标签且计算高效。

Conclusion: 所提框架显著提升CLIP的无监督适应能力，为噪声伪标签问题提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型对提示词微小变化的敏感性，导致输出不一致或不准确的问题。

Method: 利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）分析输出图像与用户提示，检测不匹配之处并生成优化后的提示，通过迭代优化提升结果。

Result: TIR在多个基准数据集上提升了提示与图像的匹配度和视觉一致性，且无需修改黑盒T2I模型。

Conclusion: TIR通过闭环提示优化策略，显著改善了文本到图像生成的质量，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

TL;DR: 本文比较了贝叶斯优化（BO）和多保真度贝叶斯优化（MFBO）在优化自旋体结构能量吸收（EA）问题中的表现，发现MFBO在多种超参数设置下能比BO表现更好，最高提升11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着有限元模拟精度提高但计算成本增加，需要一种高效的数据驱动设计方法。BO和MFBO虽被用于优化高成本目标函数，但缺乏在真实工程问题（如自旋体结构设计）中的直接比较。

Method: 采用Sobol'采样和基于方差的敏感性分析降低设计问题复杂度，并比较BO和MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题中的性能。

Result: MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题时表现优于BO，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: MFBO是解决高成本数据驱动设计问题的有效方法，结果支持多保真度技术的实用性。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型混合激活函数S3和S4，S4通过平滑过渡机制在多项任务中表现优于基线函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数如ReLU存在死神经元问题，sigmoid和tanh存在梯度消失问题，需改进。

Method: S3结合sigmoid（负输入）和softsign（正输入），S4引入平滑过渡参数k。

Result: S4在MNIST、Iris分类和Boston Housing回归任务中表现最佳，收敛更快且梯度稳定。

Conclusion: 混合激活函数是改进神经网络训练动态的有前景方向，S4因其可调参数k更具适应性。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习（RL）基于马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），但在实际场景中，马尔可夫假设常不成立，且传统方法难以捕捉复杂网络拓扑的空间关系。

Method: 提出了一种空间-时间RL方法，利用GNN捕捉网络拓扑的空间动态，RNN捕捉时间流量模式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和对网络拓扑变化的鲁棒性上优于传统RL技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通信网络中的路由优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据发现方法未考虑数据源质量对机器学习任务性能的影响，需解决如何选择最优数据源子集的问题。

Method: SourceGrasp基于贪婪准则和随机化，SourceSplice借鉴基因剪接概念，两者均通过评估数据源对任务效用的贡献进行选择。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，SourceSplice能以较少探索找到高效用数据源子集。

Conclusion: SourceSplice能有效提升机器学习任务性能，且对决策选择敏感。

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的时间序列数据集相似性度量方法，通过将数据集视为多元正态分布的实例，计算其Wasserstein距离来衡量相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型研究的兴起需要衡量时间序列数据集的相似性，以支持模型选择、微调和可视化。

Method: 将时间序列数据集视为多元正态分布的实例，利用Wasserstein距离计算其相似性。

Result: 实验和可视化表明该方法有效，Wasserstein距离能识别相似数据集，并与推理损失高度相关（>0.60）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在衡量时间序列数据集相似性方面具有有效性，尤其适用于基础模型的性能评估。

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

TL;DR: CTG-Insight是一个多代理LLM系统，用于解释胎儿心率和子宫收缩信号，提供透明且可解释的输出，准确率达96.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程胎儿监测系统缺乏可解释性，导致原始CTG数据难以理解。

Method: 利用多代理LLM系统分解CTG信号为五个医学特征，并通过聚合代理生成整体分类和自然语言解释。

Result: 在NeuroFetalNet数据集上，CTG-Insight达到96.4%的准确率和97.8%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可解释且可扩展的CTG分析框架。

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Result: SHAP提升了模型透明度和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型结合SHAP可有效支持电力负荷预测，适用于中期规划。

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric
power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather
variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential
for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), for forecasting system-wide electricity load up to one year in
advance. Midterm forecasting has shown to be crucial for maintenance
scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market
participation. The paper places a focus on the use of a method called "Shapley
Additive Explanations" (SHAP) to improve model explainability. SHAP enables the
quantification of feature contributions, guiding informed feature engineering
and improving both model transparency and forecasting accuracy.

Motivation: 神经科学领域因碎片化研究而缺乏统一的认知模型，TRIBE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合文本、音频和视频预训练模型，使用Transformer处理时间动态，预测fMRI响应。

Conclusion: TRIBE为构建统一的人类大脑表征模型奠定了基础，适用于感知和理解任务。

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化领域特定数据集构建的框架，通过多轮退火运行估计数据源的扩展规律，以指导资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖单点估计导致资源分配决策不准确的问题，特别是在不同计算规模下数据扩展行为不一致的情况下。

Method: 扩展单点估计方法，通过多轮退火运行（不同计算资源用于数据筛选和训练）估计数据源的扩展规律。

Result: 实验验证了方法在70亿参数预训练模型上的有效性，展示了不同数据源的扩展行为差异。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地指导数据源选择和资源分配，优于传统的单点估计方法。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

Motivation: 时空海洋数据复杂且独特，现有研究缺乏全面综述，阻碍了计算机科学家和海洋科学家在该领域的进展。

Method: 回顾常用数据集，探讨数据质量增强技术，将STDM研究分为预测、事件检测、模式挖掘和异常检测四类任务。

Result: 总结了STDM在海洋科学中的关键技术，并讨论了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本综述有助于跨学科科学家理解STDM的基础概念、关键技术和开放挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid amassing of spatial-temporal (ST) ocean data, many
spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address
various oceanic issues, including climate forecasting and disaster warning.
Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more
complicated but with unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high
sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM
models on ST ocean data. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of existing studies remains missing in the literature, which hinders not only
computer scientists from identifying the research issues in ocean data mining
but also ocean scientists to apply advanced STDM techniques. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey of existing STDM studies for ocean science.
Concretely, we first review the widely-used ST ocean datasets and highlight
their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement
techniques are explored. Next, we classify existing STDM studies in ocean
science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern
mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate on the techniques for these tasks.
Finally, promising research opportunities are discussed. This survey can help
scientists from both computer science and ocean science better understand the
fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM for ocean
science.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式——表征赋权，强调通过内部知识结构的可控维护和多样化来实现智能体的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能研究过于关注外部目标和任务，导致智能体缺乏适应性。作者希望通过内部表征赋权来提升智能体的准备能力。

Method: 提出表征赋权作为新的学习目标，衡量智能体对自身知识结构的可控维护和多样化能力。

Result: 表征赋权为设计适应性智能系统提供了新视角，强调了内部表征的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过将控制焦点转向内部知识结构，表征赋权为智能体的适应性提供了新方向。

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: W-CFM改进CFM框架，通过加权训练对提升生成效率与准确性，避免昂贵的小批量最优传输计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFM生成的路径偏离直线插值，导致生成慢且不准确，需改进。

Method: 提出W-CFM，用Gibbs核加权训练对，近似熵最优传输耦合。

Result: W-CFM在合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线，保持计算效率。

Conclusion: W-CFM在性能和效率上优于传统CFM，解决了小批量OT的瓶颈。

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于聚类的交叉验证策略，提出了一种结合Mini Batch K-Means和类别分层的技术，并在20个数据集上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统交叉验证可能因数据子集不具代表性而导致性能估计偏差的问题。

Method: 提出结合Mini Batch K-Means与类别分层的交叉验证技术，并在多种数据集上对比不同策略的偏差、方差和计算成本。

Result: 新方法在平衡数据集上表现更优，但在不平衡数据集中传统分层交叉验证仍更有效。聚类算法比较中无单一算法显著突出。

Conclusion: 研究改进了模型评估策略，验证了聚类数据分割的潜力，同时肯定了传统分层交叉验证的可靠性。

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏传感器布局、噪声测量和不完整数据采集下的信号恢复问题。

Method: 结合压缩感知技术和浅层循环解码器，使用ℓ1正则化和自适应损失函数（结合MSE、MAE和SNR正则化）。

Result: 在多种复杂问题中表现优于传统方法，显著提高了重建保真度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CS-SHRED在环境、气候和科学数据分析中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

Conclusion: 该框架为模型异构的个性化联邦学习提供了高效、隐私友好的解决方案，并可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FLPO问题是NP难问题，具有混合离散-连续结构和高非凸目标，传统方法难以高效解决。

Method: 整合最大熵原理（MEP）与最短路径网络（SPN），一种置换不变的编码器-解码器，实现高效梯度优化。

Result: SPN比MEP基线快100倍，最优性差距约6%；FLPO方法比元启发式基线成本低10倍，速度更快，与Gurobi最优解匹配且快1500倍。

Conclusion: 结构化深度模型在大规模混合整数优化任务中表现出色，为ParaSDM问题设定了新标准。

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在移动和边缘设备上的部署增加，优化模型效率变得至关重要。混合精度量化虽优于均匀量化，但找到每层的最佳精度仍具挑战性。

Method: MSQ采用圆钳位量化器和正则化技术，通过Hessian信息同时修剪多个最低有效位，减少显存需求和训练复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，MSQ可减少8倍训练参数和86%训练时间，同时保持竞争性准确率和压缩率。

Conclusion: MSQ是一种适用于资源受限设备的高效DNN训练解决方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Spec-VLA展示了推测执行在VLA预测中的潜力，为更广泛应用提供可能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

TL;DR: RANA是一个鲁棒的主动学习框架，用于解决网络对齐中的结构噪声和标签噪声问题，通过噪声感知选择模块和标签去噪模块提升模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有网络对齐研究主要关注标签稀疏性问题，而忽略了噪声对模型性能的显著影响，包括结构噪声和标签噪声。

Method: RANA引入噪声感知选择模块（通过清洁度评分处理结构噪声）和标签去噪模块（利用多源融合策略处理标签噪声）。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，RANA在对齐准确性上优于现有的主动学习方法。

Conclusion: RANA通过有效处理噪声和标签稀疏性，显著提升了网络对齐模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型激活函数RCR-AF，结合GELU和ReLU的优点，通过控制模型稀疏性和容量提升对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗攻击，激活函数作为关键但未充分探索的组件，可能提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 设计RCR-AF，结合GELU的平滑性和ReLU的单调性，通过超参数α和γ控制模型复杂度和稀疏性。

Result: RCR-AF在标准训练和对抗训练中均优于ReLU、GELU和Swish，提升干净准确率和对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RCR-AF通过理论分析和实验验证，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

TL;DR: Proto-EVFL是一个通过双原型增强的垂直联邦学习框架，解决了类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习（VFL）中，未对齐样本的类别不平衡会导致特征表示不足和模型预测空间受限，影响学习效果。

Method: 引入类原型和概率双原型学习方案，动态选择未对齐样本，并通过混合先验引导模块和自适应门控特征聚合策略优化特征贡献。

Result: 实验证明Proto-EVFL在零样本场景下优于基线至少6.97%，并具有1/√T的收敛速度。

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL有效解决了VFL中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能，是首个双层次优化框架。

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Result: 在图像分类和生成任务中，显著缩小了现有方法与精确遗忘的差距，有效减少有害内容生成。

Conclusion: LoReUn是一种简单高效的机器遗忘方法，适用于生成模型中的有害内容预防。

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

Motivation: 由于深度神经网络在边缘设备上的计算负载过重，网络压缩技术变得至关重要。然而，现有方法在部署时仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出分数阶高斯滤波器（FGFs），利用Grünwald-Letnikov分数阶导数近似分数阶微分方程，并结合自适应非结构化剪枝（AUP）实现高压缩比。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet2012上，FGFP框架显著减少模型大小（分别达85.2%和69.1%），精度损失仅为1.52%和1.63%。

Conclusion: FGFP框架在压缩深度神经网络方面表现出色，平衡了模型大小和精度，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

Result: AutoML-DEC优于传统聚类方法，BN模型准确率95.6%，SUMO验证显示高可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效预测拥堵，提升城市交通流畅性。

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Conclusion: Zipf定律对齐是一种鲁棒且通用的词汇量选择标准。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator
model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the
theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation
has the highest accuracy.

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in
2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall

Result: 在多个LLM上实现困惑度降低1.3-30.5%，下游任务效用提升5.6%，梯度更新预算节省71%。

Conclusion: RLDP在保持相同隐私保护水平的同时，显著提升了模型效用和训练效率。

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

Result: 模型在合成数据和拟南芥胚胎细胞中表现良好，解决了现有几何规则无法解释的分裂模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习在理解细胞分裂模式和生成新假设方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

Motivation: CAR T细胞工程中，由于组合空间巨大且实验数据有限，传统方法难以有效探索和优化。量子计算提供了一种潜在解决方案。

Method: 使用投影量子核（PQK）将经典数据嵌入高维希尔伯特空间，通过核方法测量样本相似性，并在61量子位的门控量子计算机上实现。

Result: PQK在CAR T细胞毒性预测中表现优于经典机器学习方法，特别是在信息较少的信号域和域位置上。

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限问题中具有潜力，PQK为CAR T细胞工程提供了新的优化途径。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

Motivation: 由于目标数据集中通常缺乏真实标签，直接评估模型在真实世界中的性能不可行。现有方法主要依赖置信度分数估计准确率，但在临床领域中存在类别不平衡和数据偏移的问题。

Method: 论文扩展了现有性能预测方法，直接估计完整的混淆矩阵，并在胸部X光数据上测试了其在真实世界数据偏移和模拟偏移下的表现。

Result: 提出的混淆矩阵估计方法在医学图像分布偏移下可靠地预测了临床相关计数指标，但模拟偏移场景揭示了现有性能估计技术的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医学AI模型的后市场监测中，需要更好地理解真实世界部署环境以改进性能监控技术。

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Conclusion: G-Core在RLHF训练中取得先进成果，为大规模人类对齐模型的未来研究和部署提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal

informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained

Conclusion: 神经网络确实依赖可解释的学习模式，这一发现对知识发现和可信AI系统开发有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法仅优化最终任务成功率，导致代理推理路径低效且脆弱，难以泛化。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中，RLVMR达到83.6%的成功率，推理质量显著提升。

Conclusion: RLVMR通过改进推理质量，实现了更高效、鲁棒和可解释的自主代理。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

Motivation: 解决传统去中心化PCA方法中每个智能体需访问完整样本空间的限制，处理智能体仅观测部分维度数据的挑战。

Result: 算法满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私保证，收敛速度受网络拓扑影响，实验显示在中等隐私区间表现优越。

Conclusion: D-DP-PM在隐私与效用间取得良好平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成模型的经典和量子在线算法，用于学习有限和无限时间范围的平均奖励MDP，避免了传统RL的乐观不确定性范式，并展示了量子算法在时间依赖性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法（如乐观不确定性和后验采样）在解决MDP问题时存在局限性，论文旨在通过生成模型和量子算法提供更优的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合探索-生成强化学习模型，结合经典和量子算法近似最优策略，避免传统RL范式。

Result: 量子算法在有限时间范围MDP中实现对数时间依赖的遗憾界，优于经典算法的平方根依赖；无限时间范围中提出新的遗憾度量，量子算法表现指数级更优。

Conclusion: 论文展示了生成模型和量子算法在MDP学习中的优势，为RL领域提供了新的理论突破和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

TL;DR: TrustTrack是一种协议，为基于LLM的自主代理提供可验证性保障，包括身份验证、政策承诺和防篡改行为日志，旨在实现信任原生的自主系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM驱动的自主代理在高风险领域的广泛应用，确保其可验证性成为关键挑战。

Method: 引入TrustTrack协议，嵌入结构性保障，将合规性作为设计约束而非事后监督。

Result: TrustTrack为制药、法律自动化和AI协作等受监管领域提供了新的系统范式。

Conclusion: 从云到AI再到代理和信任的过渡，是自主系统架构的下一个关键层。

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in
high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge
is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a
protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy
commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent
infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By
treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,
TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and
jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use
cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and
AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust
transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

### [183] [Successor Features for Transfer in Alternating Markov Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22278)
*Sunny Amatya,Yi Ren,Zhe Xu,Wenlong Zhang*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于后继特征的算法GGPI，用于在零和、完全信息、回合制游戏中实现知识迁移，解决了传统方法因任务差异导致的失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统游戏中的知识迁移依赖于价值和均衡转移，但任务差异大时容易失败。本文旨在利用后继特征提升迁移效果。

Method: 提出Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI)算法，支持在多智能体强化学习中迁移学习值和策略。

Result: 实验表明，GGPI在追逐-逃避游戏中能生成高奖励交互和单次策略迁移，且在更广初始条件下表现优于基线算法。

Conclusion: GGPI算法通过任务相似性量化迁移误差上限，有效提升了知识迁移的效率和成功率。

Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum,
complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent
systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for
agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge
transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which
heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to
failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper
presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel
algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to
address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed
algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An
upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity
of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we
demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and
one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial
conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path
efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.

Motivation: 在多智能体系统中，准确预测邻近智能体的未来位置对系统能力提升至关重要。传统方法依赖静态图模型，无法充分捕捉动态关系。

Method: 采用EvolveGCN动态图卷积网络，结合Clohessy-Wiltshire运动方程的物理约束损失函数，预测智能体间关系的动态演化。

Result: 该方法提高了多智能体场景中未来状态估计的可靠性和物理合理性。

Conclusion: 动态图模型与物理约束的结合为多智能体系统的预测问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of autonomous systems, interaction among
agents within a shared environment is both inevitable and essential for
enhancing overall system capabilities. A key requirement in such multi-agent
systems is the ability of each agent to reliably predict the future positions
of its nearest neighbors. Traditionally, graphs and graph theory have served as
effective tools for modeling inter agent communication and relationships. While
this approach is widely used, the present work proposes a novel method that
leverages dynamic graphs in a forward looking manner. Specifically, the
employment of EvolveGCN, a dynamic graph convolutional network, to forecast the
evolution of inter-agent relationships over time. To improve prediction
accuracy and ensure physical plausibility, this research incorporates physics
constrained loss functions based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of motion.
This integrated approach enhances the reliability of future state estimations
in multi-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: CP-Solver能处理不可控代理的不确定性，提供统计保证的无碰撞路径，适用于一次性及持续任务。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers do not account for uncertain
behavior of uncontrollable agents. We present a novel variant of Enhanced
Conflict-Based Search (ECBS), for both one-shot and lifelong MAPF in dynamic
environments with uncontrollable agents. Our method consists of (1) training a
learned predictor for the movement of uncontrollable agents, (2) quantifying
the prediction error using conformal prediction (CP), a tool for statistical
uncertainty quantification, and (3) integrating these uncertainty intervals
into our modified ECBS solver. Our method can account for uncertain agent
behavior, comes with statistical guarantees on collision-free paths for
one-shot missions, and scales to lifelong missions with a receding horizon
sequence of one-shot instances. We run our algorithm, CP-Solver, across
warehouse and game maps, with competitive throughput and reduced collisions.

Abstract: While increasing attention has been paid to co-speech gesture synthesis, most
previous works neglect to investigate hand gestures with explicit and essential
semantics. In this paper, we study co-speech gesture generation with an
emphasis on specific hand gesture activation, which can deliver more
instructional information than common body movements. To achieve this, we first
build a high-quality dataset of 3D human body movements including a set of
semantically explicit hand gestures that are commonly used by live streamers.
Then we present a hybrid-modality gesture generation system GestureHYDRA built
upon a hybrid-modality diffusion transformer architecture with novelly designed
motion-style injective transformer layers, which enables advanced gesture
modeling ability and versatile gesture operations. To guarantee these specific
hand gestures can be activated, we introduce a cascaded retrieval-augmented
generation strategy built upon a semantic gesture repository annotated for each
subject and an adaptive audio-gesture synchronization mechanism, which
substantially improves semantic gesture activation and production efficiency.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
achieves superior performance over all the counterparts. The project page can

Conclusion: 软翻转机器人具备在复杂环境中高效运输载荷的潜力，为实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid
robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and
safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have
been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move
and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous
work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation
capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads
in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under
debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this
work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy
larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what
objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.
Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of
payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict
payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft
everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though
a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and
movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads
in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through
circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry
out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m
in length.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots integrate the agility of legs for navigating rough
terrains while harnessing the efficiency of wheels for smooth surfaces.
However, most existing designs do not fully capitalize on the benefits of both
legged and wheeled structures, which limits overall system flexibility and
efficiency. We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced
steering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a
distinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design
approaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of
freedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient
movement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex
terrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between
different locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and
optimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's
mechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)
controller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward
structure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework
enables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that
facilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.
Furthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel
and highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic
advantages of both locomotion modes. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate FLORES's enhanced steering capabilities, improved navigation
efficiency, and versatile locomotion across various terrains. The open-source

Result: 系统能准确标记需要高交互力的区域，支持土壤感知规划。

Conclusion: 该方法在地形塑造自主性中显示出潜力。

Abstract: Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统缺乏可解释性，需确保运动计划的安全性，因此需要一种既能检测所有不安全计划（完备性）又不误判安全计划（可靠性）的安全监控方法。

Method: 利用多模态轨迹预测器近似周围智能体的FRS，通过凸优化程序提取数据驱动的FRS，并结合场景上下文（如车道拓扑和智能体历史）进行校准。使用共形预测保证FRS覆盖真实轨迹，并通过贝叶斯滤波器动态调整FRS的保守性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了可靠性，同时保持了完备性。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型自动驾驶系统提供了一种实用且可靠的安全监控方案。

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

Motivation: 为安全验证自动驾驶系统（ADS），需要准确估计场景参数的PDF，但传统方法存在假设限制或维度灾难问题。

Method: 采用Normalizing Flows（NF）进行PDF估计，NF通过可逆映射将简单分布转换为复杂分布，支持高维密度估计且无需对PDF形状做限制性假设。

Conclusion: NF在场景化安全验证中具有潜力，未来可优化NF架构和训练方法以进一步提升其适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

we will elaborate on how the use of scenario databases fits with methods
developed in the Horizon Europe projects that focus on safety assessment

Conclusion: 该框架为陆地-空中双模态机器人提供了一种高效、轻量的导航解决方案，显著提升了性能与实用性。

Abstract: Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive
computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a
two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by

Motivation: 传统下水道管道故障检测方法依赖人工检查CCTV录像，效率低且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合可解释深度学习异常检测（空间定位）与SPRT（时间证据聚合），实现时空分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统提高了异常检测性能，增强了检测的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的时空分析系统为下水道管道检测提供了可靠且鲁棒的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Sewer pipe faults, such as leaks and blockages, can lead to severe
consequences including groundwater contamination, property damage, and service
disruption. Traditional inspection methods rely heavily on the manual review of
CCTV footage collected by mobile robots, which is inefficient and susceptible
to human error. To automate this process, we propose a novel system
incorporating explainable deep learning anomaly detection combined with
sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT). The anomaly detector processes
single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies,
whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness
against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate
improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the
combined spatiotemporal analysis system for reliable and robust sewer
inspection.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发通用足式机器人控制器提供了可扩展的解决方案，同时保持接近最优的性能。

Abstract: Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies
remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches
either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise
performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student
framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train
specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing
the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill
this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy
capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments
across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach
preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer
architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies
and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that
Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by
leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across
different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful
deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability
of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable
solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain
near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.

Motivation: 自动驾驶功能的严格验证与验证（V&V）对确保安全和公众接受至关重要，但现有方法计算成本高且耗时。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化（BO）框架，用于高效发现关键场景，并以模型预测控制器（MPC）为基础的运动规划器为例进行验证。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效识别多个关键区域，为自动驾驶验证提供了一种更快速、更经济的方法。

Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions
(ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve
sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a
vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible
scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces
a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of
critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an
Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it
identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of
magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE)
methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework
in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple,
distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case
study .

Motivation: 模仿学习常因因果混淆导致性能下降，需解决此问题。

Method: 引入GABRIL，利用人类注视数据指导表征学习，通过正则化损失聚焦因果相关特征。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA实验中，GABRIL性能分别提升179%和76%，并提供额外可解释性。

Conclusion: GABRIL有效减少因果混淆，提升模仿学习性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

TL;DR: QPAudioEraser是一种量子启发的音频遗忘框架，用于高效擦除语音数据中的个体特征，同时最小化对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音认证和音频生物识别系统的普及增加了隐私风险，现有方法无法有效处理音频数据的高维和时序特性。

Method: 采用四阶段方法：权重初始化、标签变换、量子损失函数和权重混合，以实现目标特征的完全擦除。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上验证，QPAudioEraser实现了目标数据的完全擦除（0%遗忘准确率），对模型性能影响极小（仅0.05%）。

Conclusion: QPAudioEraser是一种高效的隐私保护解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric
systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with
sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right
to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient
erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric
models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately
handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals,
leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address
this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning
framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using
destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based
label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an
uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired
mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech
Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate
QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure
of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model
utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%.
QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across
single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios,
establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.

Motivation: 解决单分支和双分支架构在SELD任务中的优化冲突和信息交换限制。

Method: 1. 轨迹重排序保持时序一致性；2. 分离训练SED和DoA网络；3. 融合特征提升性能。

Result: 在2023 DCASE挑战赛数据集上验证了框架的有效性，提升了事件分类和定位。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了单双分支的局限性，优化了SELD任务的表现。

Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is crucial in spatial audio
processing, enabling systems to detect sound events and estimate their 3D
directions. Existing SELD methods use single- or dual-branch architectures:
single-branch models share SED and DoA representations, causing optimization
conflicts, while dual-branch models separate tasks but limit information
exchange. To address this, we propose a two-step learning framework. First, we
introduce a tracwise reordering format to maintain temporal consistency,
preventing event reassignments across tracks. Next, we train SED and DoA
networks to prevent interference and ensure task-specific feature learning.
Finally, we effectively fuse DoA and SED features to enhance SELD performance
with better spatial and event representation. Experiments on the 2023 DCASE
challenge Task 3 dataset validate our framework, showing its ability to
overcome single- and dual-branch limitations and improve event classification
and localization.

Result: 实验表明，该模型在对齐准确率上提升了约11.3%，并增强了零样本TTS模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的时长预测框架显著提升了TTS模型的对齐性能和适应性。

Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech
(TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to
learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle
and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading
to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models
rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration
models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction
framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with
given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise
prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline
models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment
accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the
mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

Conclusion: Dragon-FM成功结合AR与流匹配，为长内容生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced
generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which
rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow
generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV)
caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel
text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model
processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per
second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global
coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast
iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache
across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it
bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous
AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers.
This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the
proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content.
Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its
capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Conclusion: 该框架为LEO卫星网络中的分布式智能提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Result: 平均优化迭代次数减少53%，目标函数值差异低于4%，即使在训练域外也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于参数化拓扑优化问题。

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic
structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead
of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the
optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach
devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the
method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a
surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation
method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping
between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space
determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the
parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional
representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an
educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the
intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing
equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential
errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the
design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.
Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation
capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The
quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by
reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while
achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective
functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to
extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

Conclusion: 该研究为AI在航天器自主控制中的应用奠定了基础，并展示了RL算法的实际可行性。

Abstract: A RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm was developed for command automation
onboard a 3U CubeSat. This effort focused on the implementation of macro
control action RL, a technique in which an onboard agent is provided with
compiled information based on live telemetry as its observation. The agent uses
this information to produce high-level actions, such as adjusting attitude to
solar pointing, which are then translated into control algorithms and executed
through lower-level instructions. Once trust in the onboard agent is
established, real-time environmental information can be leveraged for faster
response times and reduced reliance on ground control. The approach not only
focuses on developing an RL algorithm for a specific satellite but also sets a
precedent for integrating trusted AI into onboard systems. This research builds
on previous work in three areas: (1) RL algorithms for issuing high-level
commands that are translated into low-level executable instructions; (2) the
deployment of AI inference models interfaced with live operational systems,
particularly onboard spacecraft; and (3) strategies for building trust in AI
systems, especially for remote and autonomous applications. Existing RL
research for satellite control is largely limited to simulation-based
experiments; in this work, these techniques are tailored by constructing a
digital twin of a specific spacecraft and training the RL agent to issue macro
actions in this simulated environment. The policy of the trained agent is
copied to an isolated environment, where it is fed compiled information about
the satellite to make inference predictions, thereby demonstrating the RL
algorithm's validity on orbit without granting it command authority. This
process enables safe comparison of the algorithm's predictions against actual
satellite behavior and ensures operation within expected parameters.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络控制系统提供了从理论到实际实现的完整端到端安全验证解决方案。

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical
neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing
their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured
throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon
verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent
approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based
guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for
roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper
bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations
by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing,
actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the
problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions,
and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal
proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this
bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to
synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete
end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the
automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with
rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和推荐模型上验证了RecPS在风险评估和模型遗忘中的有效性。

Conclusion: RecPS为隐私感知的推荐系统开发提供了量化工具，支持用户隐私保护。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.

Conclusion: MMSC通过多模态和自监督学习有效解决了推荐系统中的关键挑战。

Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item
representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and
complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item
associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or
leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook
critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to
the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose
MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning
framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three
main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that
leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a
self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and
learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation
aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic
and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training
data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct
extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC
outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and
39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that
MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.

Abstract: Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk
assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year,
exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data
are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution
and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers
excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image
data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more
comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing
the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.
However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating
spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge
representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and
predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal
knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light
satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and
county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for
constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,
GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual
outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from
2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and
reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We
demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power
outages.

TL;DR: RecGPT是一个基于用户意图的推荐系统框架，通过整合大型语言模型（LLM）优化推荐流程，解决了传统日志拟合方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖历史共现模式和日志拟合目标，容易过拟合，无法捕捉用户潜在兴趣，导致推荐生态不可持续。

Method: 提出RecGPT框架，利用LLM在用户兴趣挖掘、物品检索和解释生成等关键阶段进行意图建模，并通过多阶段训练范式（包括推理增强预对齐和自训练进化）优化模型。

Result: 在淘宝App上部署后，RecGPT显著提升了内容多样性、用户满意度、商家曝光和转化率。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的意图中心设计能够构建更可持续、多方受益的推荐生态系统。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful applications of artificial
intelligence, serving as critical infrastructure connecting users, merchants,
and platforms. However, most current industrial systems remain heavily reliant
on historical co-occurrence patterns and log-fitting objectives, i.e.,
optimizing for past user interactions without explicitly modeling user intent.
This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical
preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a
result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately
harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole
recommendation ecosystem.
  To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of
recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places
user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large
language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval,
and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into
an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the
above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a
multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced
pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative
judge system. Currently, RecGPT has been fully deployed on the Taobao App.
Online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves consistent performance
gains across stakeholders: users benefit from increased content diversity and
satisfaction, merchants and the platform gain greater exposure and conversions.
These comprehensive improvement results across all stakeholders validates that
LLM-driven, intent-centric design can foster a more sustainable and mutually
beneficial recommendation ecosystem.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in
optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of
e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed
to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting
fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit
behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised
learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of
latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity,
intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of
adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user
intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query
rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and
downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product
verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight
the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user
inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation
for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于k空间的建模方法，用于高效预测多通道参数阵列扬声器（MCPAL）系统的声场，计算速度提升了四个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCPAL系统在生成定向音频束方面具有潜力，但其复杂非线性行为和多通道信号处理使得声场预测困难。

Method: 采用k空间方法，先通过角谱法求解线性超声场，再在k空间中高效计算准线性音频声场。

Result: 计算速度比直接积分法快四个数量级，且无需依赖近轴近似。

Conclusion: 该方法为MCPAL系统的仿真和设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Multi-channel parametric array loudspeaker (MCPAL) systems offer enhanced
flexibility and promise for generating highly directional audio beams in
real-world applications. However, efficient and accurate prediction of their
generated sound fields remains a major challenge due to the complex nonlinear
behavior and multi-channel signal processing involved. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose a k-space approach for modeling arbitrary MCPAL systems
arranged on a baffled planar surface. In our method, the linear ultrasound
field is first solved using the angular spectrum approach, and the quasilinear
audio sound field is subsequently computed efficiently in k-space. By
leveraging three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms, our approach not only
achieves high computational and memory efficiency but also maintains accuracy
without relying on the paraxial approximation. For typical configurations
studied, the proposed method demonstrates a speed-up of more than four orders
of magnitude compared to the direct integration method. Our proposed approach
paved the way for simulating and designing advanced MCPAL systems.

Result: 110M参数模型性能优于传统<10M参数模型，压缩后模型性能损失<1.5%。

Conclusion: 大模型结合蒸馏技术可高效处理复杂实时sEMG任务。

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for
developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into
muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and
computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation
of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we
demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on
sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters,
surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually
<10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively
distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5%
absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex
real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在噪声环境下显著优于基线，同时提升了干净语音的检测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为噪声环境下的语音活动检测提供了高效且轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a
challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in
automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where
noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the
voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice
signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain
light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models
often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic
environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment,
but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a
noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing
and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach
significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires
neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly
in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD
additionally improving clean speech detection.

Conclusion: 模型揭示了机器人物质的自组织行为及其与复杂机器人系统的相似性。

Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities
when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents
are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of
whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact,
shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena
would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic
matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed
with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the
particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic
matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between
long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and
frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures
of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition
is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle
interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of
robotic systems.

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Conclusion: 该混合算法在物联网节点定位中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

Abstract: We present a systematic approach for evaluating the quality of knowledge
graph repairs with respect to constraint violations defined in shapes
constraint language (SHACL). Current evaluation methods rely on \emph{ad hoc}
datasets, which limits the rigorous analysis of repair systems in more general

using a novel mechanism, termed violation-inducing operations (VIOs). We use
the proposed evaluation framework to assess a range of repair systems which we
build using large language models. We analyze the performance of these systems
across different prompting strategies. Results indicate that concise prompts
containing both the relevant violated SHACL constraints and key contextual
information from the knowledge graph yield the best performance.

Conclusion: ScanGen有效解决了扫描仪偏差问题，增强了计算病理学模型的临床实用性。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining
actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been
at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance,
it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those
introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This
may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired
by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in
CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent
pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain
generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a
multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias.
Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function
applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby
enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied
to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe
that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while
retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

Result: 实验表明该方法在无需人工标注的情况下，显著提升了比特流损坏视频的恢复质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为多媒体通信和存储系统提供了更可靠的视频恢复解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated
segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using
positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for
structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was
trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans,
with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with
scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy,
particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake
within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus,
and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square
error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a
classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake
quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results
highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic
pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available.
This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation,
enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research
applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to
diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain
activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial
precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity --
remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio,
and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer
vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns
transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via
spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.
Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human
Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves
downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory
and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate
performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient
attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in
pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer
learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome
challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过将衍射光学元件（DOE）放置在离孔径位置的方法，以提升宽视场下的成像质量，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs
with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks.
However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining
high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational
complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while
accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of
placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a
global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work
explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,
enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local
control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages
hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and
wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and
demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the
off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of
approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming
traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and
depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE
configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications
validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Conclusion: 结合深度和表面信息的方法显著提升了脊柱形态估计的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and
appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common
form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant
limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and
remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB
images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible
to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model
stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel
pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,
compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine
morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the
subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an
adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale
Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both
patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based
Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)
module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our
depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different
evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,
respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we
integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.
This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,
achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is
it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In
this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods --
a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and
infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that
provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for
given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in
the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all
controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data
fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish
the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the
proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and
in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of
hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using
several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative
model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy.
However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained
optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its
applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible
or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds
for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally
efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing
estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,
eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus
reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation
properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the
proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.
Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel
principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to
two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and
low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle

generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual

validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

Conclusion: 提出的同步准则有效解决了自注意力动力学的同步范围问题，为相关模型提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Strategic Deflection（SDeflection）的防御方法，通过语义转移而非直接拒绝来应对LLM的越狱攻击，显著降低了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）在关键领域的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为重要课题。传统防御方法依赖拒绝恶意提示，但新型攻击已能绕过这些措施。

Method: SDeflection通过生成语义接近用户请求但去除有害意图的答案，而非直接拒绝，以中和攻击者的意图。

Result: 实验表明，SDeflection显著降低了攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持了对良性查询的模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着防御策略从简单拒绝转向战略内容转移，以应对高级威胁。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas,
ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While
traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent
logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by
directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We
introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the
LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model
produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet
strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful
intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers
Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign
queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving
from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced
threats.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to exploit large language models (LLMs) by inducing
them to generate harmful content, thereby revealing their vulnerabilities.
Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field
of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct

persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of
persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic
algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass

Abstract: Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread,
making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important.
Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and
execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using
the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of
success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing
attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating
each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an
attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This
approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization,
ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.

Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational
efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC)
systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown
promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator
trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that
integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language
explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as
LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s
inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs,
including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate
human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o
mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack
target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and
2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These
results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time
detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical
need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.

Abstract: With the increasing security issues in blockchain, smart contract
vulnerability detection has become a research focus. Existing vulnerability
detection methods have their limitations: 1) Static analysis methods struggle
with complex scenarios. 2) Methods based on specialized pre-trained models
perform well on specific datasets but have limited generalization capabilities.
In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive ability in adapting to new vulnerability patterns. However, they
often underperform on specific vulnerability types compared to methods based on
specialized pre-trained models. We also observe that explanations generated by
general-purpose LLMs can provide fine-grained code understanding information,
contributing to improved detection performance.
  Inspired by these observations, we propose SAEL, an LLM-based framework for
smart contract vulnerability detection. We first design targeted prompts to
guide LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities and generating explanations, which
serve as prediction features. Next, we apply prompt-tuning on CodeT5 and T5 to
process contract code and explanations, enhancing task-specific performance. To
combine the strengths of each approach, we introduce an Adaptive
Mixture-of-Experts architecture. This dynamically adjusts feature weights via a
Gating Network, which selects relevant features using TopK filtering and
Softmax normalization, and incorporates a Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism
to enhance cross-feature relationships. This design enables effective
integration of LLM predictions, explanation features, and code features through
gradient optimization. The loss function jointly considers both independent
feature performance and overall weighted predictions. Experiments show that
SAEL outperforms existing methods across various vulnerabilities.

Result: 废弃和受限权限的排除对模型性能影响较小，某些情况下（如CNN）准确性提升，同时增强了概念漂移的检测能力。

Conclusion: 数据集平衡和排除废弃权限可提升模型性能，并有效检测概念漂移。

Abstract: Permission analysis is a widely used method for Android malware detection. It
involves examining the permissions requested by an application to access
sensitive data or perform potentially malicious actions. In recent years,
various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to Android malware
detection using permission-based features and feature selection techniques,
often achieving high accuracy. However, these studies have largely overlooked
important factors such as protection levels and the deprecation or restriction
of permissions due to updates in the Android OS -- factors that can contribute
to concept drift.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of deprecated and restricted
permissions on the performance of machine learning models. A large dataset
containing 166 permissions was used, encompassing more than 70,000 malware and
benign applications. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were
employed as classifiers, along with different concept drift detection
strategies. The results suggest that Android permissions are highly effective
features for malware detection, with the exclusion of deprecated and restricted
permissions having only a marginal impact on model performance. In some cases,
such as with CNN, accuracy improved. Excluding these permissions also enhanced
the detection of concept drift using a year-to-year analysis strategy. Dataset
balancing further improved model performance, reduced low-accuracy instances,
and enhanced concept drift detection via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Method: 使用Stable Diffusion和ControlNet生成1,860个光学幻觉，并评估6个审核分类器和9个视觉语言模型的检测性能。

Result: 现有审核模型检测仇恨性幻觉的准确率低于0.245（分类器）和0.102（视觉语言模型），存在显著漏洞。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the creation
of a new form of digital art: optical illusions--visual tricks that create
different perceptions of reality. However, adversaries may misuse such
techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages
into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work,
we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful
illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation
models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable
Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are
hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or
subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models
(VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal
significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection
accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs.
We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which
mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary
layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore
preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from
the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.

TL;DR: DeCoda是一个混合防御框架，结合了基于大语言模型（LLM）的去混淆和代码图学习，显著提高了恶意JavaScript代码检测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意JavaScript代码对用户隐私和系统安全构成严重威胁，但由于代码混淆技术和JavaScript语言特性（如嵌套闭包结构），检测这些威胁具有挑战性。

Method: DeCoda采用多阶段提示学习管道，通过LLM逐步重构混淆代码并生成标准化的AST表示；然后通过Cluster-wise Graph学习层次化代码图表示，结合图变换网络和节点聚类。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，F1分数分别达到94.64%和97.71%，比现有基线方法提高了10.74%和13.85%。在固定FPR水平下，TPR显著优于基线。

Conclusion: LLM去混淆和集群级关系建模在恶意代码检测中具有显著效果，DeCoda框架为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services,
malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user
privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats
remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and
JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure
structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid
defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation
with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated
prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM
progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs
and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2)
In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while
deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise
and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn
hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that
synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and
node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level
semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64%
and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of
10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control
evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers
4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing
baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation
and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in
detecting malicious code.

Abstract: Despite outstanding results, machine learning-based Android malware detection
models struggle with concept drift, where rapidly evolving malware
characteristics degrade model effectiveness. This study examines the impact of
concept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine
machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models
(LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and
image-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is
widespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the
drift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.
Balancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address
concept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware
landscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and
concept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables
since hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm
configurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated
promising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,
highlighting the need for further investigation.

*Yuang Cao,Jiachen Zou,Chen Wei,Quanying Liu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI驱动框架，研究视觉工作记忆中的记忆扭曲，发现相似视觉维度比语义维度更容易导致记忆失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类记忆在认知任务和日常生活中存在显著脆弱性，尤其是视觉工作记忆与新感知输入比较时可能引发记忆扭曲。研究旨在探索感知比较如何影响现实世界对象的记忆扭曲，并识别导致记忆脆弱的视觉特征。

Method: 采用AI生成自然视觉刺激，基于行为相关对象维度设计两种刺激（图像轮和维度轮），在三种视觉工作记忆实验中测试记忆扭曲情况。

Result: 实验表明，相似维度（如图像）会引发记忆扭曲，且视觉维度比语义维度更容易失真，说明自然视觉刺激的对象维度对记忆脆弱性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 视觉维度在记忆扭曲中起关键作用，为理解记忆脆弱性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Human memory exhibits significant vulnerability in cognitive tasks and daily
life. Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,
during cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous
studies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual
comparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory
distortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying
what visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel
research question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates
naturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions
to elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --
image wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated
by dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)
experiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three
conditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,
and perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar
dimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.
Specifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic
dimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual
stimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.

Motivation: 研究神经表示与计算模型内部表示的关系时，发现特征表示可能存在偏差，影响分析的准确性。

Method: 通过PCA、回归和RSA等常见分析方法，展示特征表示偏差如何导致推断偏差，并以同态加密为例说明表示与计算模式的分离。

Result: 特征表示偏差可能导致分析结果严重偏差，影响系统间的表示比较。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在神经科学中考虑特征表示偏差的重要性，以避免误解。

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a
means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural
representations to the internal representations learned by computational
models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that
learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain
features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example,
simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented
than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges
for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis.
In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature
representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common
analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption
as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between
patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of
these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for
neuroscience more generally.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了抑郁和自杀倾向患者对情感内容的敏感性改变和脱离障碍，为开发EEG生物标志物提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet
objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the
spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in
individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and
suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally
charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified
robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy
between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation
and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with
depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater
amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization
and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These
findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from
emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding
of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis
for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖人工且忽略多轮交互的实际情况，难以扩展和实用。

Method: 通过多代理游戏模拟对抗交互，生成原型对话和攻击策略库，并微调LLM作为RedCoder的核心。

Result: RedCoder在多轮对话中动态检索策略，显著提高了诱导代码漏洞的效果。

Conclusion: RedCoder为评估代码生成系统的安全性提供了可扩展且有效的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

TL;DR: RandLuzz利用大语言模型（LLMs）减少模糊测试中的随机性，通过生成可达种子和特定于错误的变异器，显著提高了错误暴露效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试中的随机性虽然有助于发现错误，但降低了效率。即使定向模糊测试减少了随机性，种子和变异器的随机性仍是一个挑战。

Method: RandLuzz结合LLMs和定向模糊测试，分析函数调用链或功能以生成可达种子，并通过LLMs分析错误原因和变异建议，构建特定于错误的变异器。

Result: RandLuzz在四个先进定向模糊测试工具上表现优异，平均加速2.1×至4.8×，并在某些错误上实现2.7×的加速，8个错误可在60秒内暴露。

Conclusion: RandLuzz通过LLMs有效减少模糊测试中的随机性，显著提升了错误暴露效率，为模糊测试提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the
second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60
seconds.

Result: 实验表明，基于CodeEvo数据微调的模型在多种难度代码生成基准测试中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: CodeEvo为代码中心数据合成提供了有效框架，并通过多角度分析提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

Motivation: 动态语言（如Python）的类型推断是一个持续挑战，LLMs在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发TypyBench基准测试，包含TypeSim（捕捉预测类型与真实类型的语义关系）和TypeCheck（评估代码库类型一致性）两种指标，并在50个高质量Python代码库上评估多种LLMs。

Result: LLMs在TypeSim上表现尚可，但在复杂嵌套类型和代码库一致性方面存在显著问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注代码库级别的类型一致性而非类型相似性，TypyBench为此提供了基础。

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency

scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large

human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient

Result: 在标准测试中达到83.1%准确率和84.8% F1分数，泛化能力优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 微调后的LLM在静态APCA任务中表现出色，为自动程序修复领域提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主系统缺乏对用户伦理偏好的考量，影响信任与个性化决策，需解决伦理协商问题。

Method: 提出RobEthiChor框架，包括领域无关架构及ROS实现RobEthiChor-Ros，支持伦理协商。

Result: 实验显示系统在73%场景中达成协议，平均协商时间0.67秒，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: RobEthiChor有效实现伦理协商，提升自主系统决策的伦理适应性与用户信任。

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

### [258] [Repair-R1: Better Test Before Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22853)
*Haichuan Hu,Xiaochen Xie,Quanjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Repair-R1是一种改进的自动程序修复（APR）方法，通过在训练阶段引入测试用例并优先生成测试，显著提高了修复成功率、测试生成成功率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based APR方法仅在推理阶段使用测试用例，忽略了测试在训练阶段的潜在贡献以及修复前测试的可能性。

Method: Repair-R1在训练阶段引入测试用例，并优先生成区分性测试用例，再基于测试进行修复，使用强化学习协同优化测试生成和修复。

Result: 实验表明，Repair-R1在修复成功率、测试生成成功率和覆盖率上分别提升了2.68%至48.29%、16.38%至53.28%和0.78%至53.96%。

Conclusion: Repair-R1通过优化测试与修复的协同，显著提升了APR的效果，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects,
generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are
often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the
code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at
https://github.com/Tomsawyerhu/APR-RL and

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何利用LLMs模拟在线不安全对话，并通过用户反馈提升安全意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（如LLMs）降低了不良行为者创建不安全对话的门槛，研究旨在通过模拟对话教育用户。

Method: 使用两个LLMs模拟诈骗对话（骗子与目标），用户为目标LLM提供反馈。

Result: 模拟出逼真的不安全对话，用户反馈有助于提升学习效果。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于模拟不安全对话，结合用户反馈能有效提升在线安全意识。

Abstract: Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) have the potential --
and already are being used -- to increase the speed, scale, and types of unsafe
conversations online. LLMs lower the barrier for entry for bad actors to create
unsafe conversations in particular because of their ability to generate
persuasive and human-like text. In our current work, we explore ways to promote
online safety by teaching people about unsafe conversations that can occur
online with and without LLMs. We build on prior work that shows that LLMs can
successfully simulate scam conversations. We also leverage research in the
learning sciences that shows that providing feedback on one's hypothetical
actions can promote learning. In particular, we focus on simulating scam
conversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with
each other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may
encounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system
are asked provide feedback to the target LLM.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自学编程者在在线学习中的挑战，并开发了一个支持自我调节的系统，通过AI生成反馈帮助学习者构建学习故事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自学编程者常感到孤立和沮丧，面临信息过载和缺乏指导的问题，而社交媒体上的自我调节实践提供了灵感。

Method: 设计了一个包含网页平台和浏览器扩展的系统，支持学习者通过AI生成反馈构建学习故事，并招募15名学习者进行测试。

Result: 用户反馈表明系统对自我调节有帮助，尤其赞赏实时反思、自动故事反馈和视频注释功能。

Conclusion: 系统展示了作为自我调节工具的潜力，并指出了未来AI增强工具的设计机会。

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

Conclusion: aLLoyM展示了LLMs在材料科学中的潜力，公开模型和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging
applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce
aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions,
temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we
curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams
using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and
assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned
Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats:
multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that
fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram
questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to
generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its
potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials
systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released
the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete
benchmarking Q&A dataset, on Hugging Face.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

Motivation: 当前方法在计算成本或空间分辨率上存在限制，无法满足对未来海平面上升的准确预测需求。

Method: 使用一致性模型（CM），基于区域气候模型MARv3.12的输出，结合冰盖地形和日照条件进行训练，并在推理时强制守恒约束。

Result: 测试集上，CM在SMB和表面温度上的表现优于插值方法，并能忠实再现空间尺度的变异性。

Conclusion: 该方法为冰盖模拟提供了快速、高分辨率的气候强迫数据，可直接用于地球系统和冰盖模型工作流，改进未来海平面上升的预测。

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface
mass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding
future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally
demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel
physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model
(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor
of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM
is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and
conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard
conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of
SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust
generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,
our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE
for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming
interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,
we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial
scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System
Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to
directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution
climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be
readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve
projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and
potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.

Conclusion: 该方法为紧凑、轻量、灵活的全息近眼显示系统提供了重要进展，满足未来VR/AR技术的严格要求。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization
approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR)
displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing
comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical
assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms
enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical
implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face
substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil
apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this
study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our
proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to
generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the
dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of
amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly
mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves
inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method
signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact,
lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent
requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

Motivation: 传统次线性期望理论在处理非凸几何不确定性模型时存在不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入一类完全耦合的均值场正倒向随机微分方程，通过点态最大化定义BSDE驱动，并假设驱动对控制变量具有一致强凹性。

Result: 证明了FBSDE系统的局部和全局适定性，并展示了所得估值函数（Θ-期望）的动态一致性和非次可加性。

Conclusion: 本文为非凸内源性模糊下的随机微积分提供了严格基础，显著区别于凸范式。

Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic
calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of
primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for
a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully
coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the
BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent,
non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong
concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which
ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central
contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from
primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire
well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for
the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation,
is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the
axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation
invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm.
This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class
of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.

TL;DR: TroVE声称通过工具生成和重用在MATH基准上优于直接生成代码的PRIMITIVE，但研究发现其优势主要来自更高的计算预算，而非工具箱机制。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估TroVE在MATH基准上的表现，分析其工具箱机制的实际贡献。

Method: 重新实现TroVE的选择机制，匹配计算预算进行比较。

Result: TroVE的性能提升主要来自计算预算，工具箱机制仅带来1%的边际改进。

Conclusion: 工具箱方法在MATH基准上未提供显著优势。

Abstract: Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem
solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex
challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language
Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and
reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an
ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and
reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only
performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,
2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often
trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from
self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on
MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does
not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget
spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small
correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,
boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\% in accuracy. After matching for
compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\%,
suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on
MATH.

Conclusion: 研究为选择检测线性相关性的方法提供了指导，并可能推广到非线性统计依赖性的分析。

Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two
high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine
when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations,
despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider
three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional
variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the
self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the
self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous,
and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices,
and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the
shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross
approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the
variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right
method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may
generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

Result: 模型表现出能量间隙、各向异性相关性和记忆容量增强（γ_c≈0.55），并与弹性网络中的剪切模量标度相似。

Conclusion: 该模型建立了联想记忆与无定形固体物理之间的联系，为连续自由度系统提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model
inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are
replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$.
The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix
through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian
matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits
quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials:
energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random
configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations
encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and
order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N
\cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a
fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$)
and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between
associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in
systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the
scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim
(Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which
closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D
central-force spring networks.

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent
structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model
assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with
a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for
estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information
across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the
datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second
approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,
then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally
computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they
have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which
is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and
dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty
about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their
potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the
asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop
optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals
that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case,
optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend
our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical
algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical
guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive
numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data
corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty
quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations
(PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from
the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling
uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture
consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder
implements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process
(LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating
between a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with
the interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function
learned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over
the solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to
the latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible
function-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft
constraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE
structure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed
neural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can
efficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian
process and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and
robust uncertainty quantification. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and reliability of the method.

Abstract: Domain adaptation seeks to leverage the abundant label information in a
source domain to improve classification performance in a target domain with
limited labels. While the field has seen extensive methodological development,
its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing
theoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target
domains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to
measures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not
fully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a
shared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain
alignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature
transformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first
derive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers
of the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize
the sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous
analysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both
MMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound
that scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our
analysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited
labeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally
to the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental
evaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature
learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and
millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,
requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that
integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our
approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance
sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We
further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly
into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This
integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but
also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several
fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN
variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive
performance and training speed.

Abstract: Machine and deep learning have grown in popularity and use in biological
research over the last decade but still present challenges in interpretability
of the fitted model. The development and use of metrics to determine features
driving predictions and increase model interpretability continues to be an open
area of research. We investigate the use of Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) on a multi-view deep learning model applied to multi-omics data for the
purposes of identifying biomolecules of interest. Rankings of features via
these attribution methods are compared across various architectures to evaluate
consistency of the method. We perform multiple computational experiments to
assess the robustness of SHAP and investigate modeling approaches and
diagnostics to increase and measure the reliability of the identification of
important features. Accuracy of a random-forest model fit on subsets of
features selected as being most influential as well as clustering quality using
only these features are used as a measure of effectiveness of the attribution
method. Our findings indicate that the rankings of features resulting from SHAP
are sensitive to the choice of architecture as well as different random
initializations of weights, suggesting caution when using attribution methods
on multi-view deep learning models applied to multi-omics data. We present an
alternative, simple method to assess the robustness of identification of
important biomolecules.

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or
missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are
carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a
preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually
define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a
non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework
to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A
dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to
train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was
modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth
into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary
faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to
train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their
results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and
optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation
results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to
represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the
centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that
an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest
number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance
threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground
truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the
preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth
margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide
the train and test datasets for the community.

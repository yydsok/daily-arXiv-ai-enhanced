In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL.

This paper focuses on the emergence of dependency\nhierarchies during task execution, aiming to understand how such hierarchies\narise from agents' collective pursuit of the joint objective, how they evolve\ndynamically, and what factors govern their development. To investigate this\nphenomenon, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is employed to train\nMASOS for a collaborative box-pushing task. By calculating the gradients of\neach agent's actions in relation to the states of other agents, the inter-agent\ndependencies are quantified, and the emergence of hierarchies is analyzed\nthrough the aggregation of these dependencies. Our results demonstrate that\nhierarchies emerge dynamically as agents work towards a joint objective, with\nthese hierarchies evolving in response to changing task requirements. Notably,\nthese dependency hierarchies emerge organically in response to the shared\nobjective, rather than being a consequence of pre-configured rules or\nparameters that can be fine-tuned to achieve specific results. Furthermore, the\nemergence of hierarchies is influenced by the task environment and network\ninitialization conditions.

However, several challenges persist,\nincluding an over-reliance on large-scale dialogue datasets, insufficient\nextraction of paralinguistic cues vital for conveying empathy, and the lack of\nempathy-specific datasets and evaluation frameworks. To address these issues,\nwe introduce OSUM-EChat, an open-source, end-to-end spoken dialogue system\ndesigned to enhance empathetic interactions, particularly in resource-limited\nsettings.

Given\nthe rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as\nimportant as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In\nthis study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to\nefficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to\nlatent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer\ncaptures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex\nfeature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation\ncapability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,\nwhich is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs\ninclude raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta\ndegree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and\naircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA\nprediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA\nprediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using\none-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October\n1 to October 31, 2022.

However, SHAP values are usually treated as point\nestimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in\npredictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three\nreal-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight\ninto the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The\nexperimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the\nreliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding\ncan guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the\nrefinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with\nmultiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are\nnot necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced\nthrough better, more representative data and following appropriate or\ncase-desired model development techniques.

This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides\ntheoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across\nlong prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nour UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower\nfalse positive rates under distribution shift.

However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy.

Traditional methods, such\nas Delphi studies, consensus conferences, and systematic guideline synthesis,\noffer structure but face limitations including high panel burden, interpretive\noversimplification, and suppression of conditional nuance. These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance\nscience confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a\nfoundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published\nconsensus frameworks at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\uff08HAH-Delphi\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210AI\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e13\u5bb6\u5171\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u5ffd\u7565\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u7ec6\u8282\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "HAH-Delphi\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u751f\u6210AI\uff08Gemini 2.5 Pro\uff09\u3001\u8d44\u6df1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c0f\u7ec4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1a\u56de\u987e\u6027\u590d\u5236\u3001\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "AI\u5728\u56de\u987e\u6027\u590d\u5236\u4e2d\u91cd\u73b095%\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u8fbe95%\uff1b\u5c0f\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c0f\u7ec4\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u8fbe\u6210>90%\u5171\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "conclusion": "HAH-Delphi\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, recent\nstudies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as\nattention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve\ncomparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits\nattributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other\narchitectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a\ncentral question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series\nanalysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that\nsystematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models\nwith dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any\nsequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This\nsubstitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical\nfoundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven\nstate-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show\nthat replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even\nsuperior performance.

In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders.

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals.

Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and\nprovide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by\nthe unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates\n15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose\nmeasurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are\nincluded, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two\nsub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and\nsub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an\nequal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,\ndata quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values\npresent a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose\nlevels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55\nminutes before hypoglycemia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6574\u5408\u4e8615\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b2510\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u540815\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b149\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u8840\u7cd6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u5fc3\u7387\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u8840\u7cd6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7387\u5728\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u524d15\u81f355\u5206\u949f\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8840\u7cd6\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

As environments and tasks become\ncomplicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the\nsurroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods\nutilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure\nsampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning\nproblem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization\nacross domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the\nlack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic\nnature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application\nin real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach\ntowards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to\nno sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space.

To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for\neffective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An\noptimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp\npoints to ensure indirect force closure.

However, existing approaches manifest two critical\nlimitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when\npersistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during\ndensity control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that\nprevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of\nGaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to\nredundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases\nmemory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges.

To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first\nevaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,\ndesigned to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,\nmobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a\nfour-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To\nanalyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the\nplug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first\nquantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on\nour benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%\nfine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,\nquantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual\nlocalization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\\%. Our diagnostic\nframework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current\nGUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully\nopen-source. github: https://github.com/AnonymousThewarehouse/FineState-Bench\nhuggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Willtime2006/Static-FineBench", "AI": {"tldr": "FineState-Bench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFineState-Bench\uff0c\u5305\u542b2257\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Visual Diagnostic Assistant\uff08VDA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a32.8%\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534714.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dGUI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for\ndynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By\ncompensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework\nalso improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior.

Given a language instruction,\nthese models process observation and navigation history to predict the most\nappropriate action for an agent.

In this work, we propose a novel\ninput-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show\nthat existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without\nsubstantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three\nadaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial\nefficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an\nagent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based\nadaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods.

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and\ndiverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,\nsuch as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing\ngenerative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and\nanatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method.

The FA engine analyses network traffic using natural\nlanguage processing techniques to identify anomalies and inefficiencies,\nsignificantly reducing the effort time required and increasing efficiency. The\nFA Engine also suggests steps to fix the issue using Generative AI via a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) trained on several 5G packet core documents.

However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with\nthe attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated\nfrom the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to\nimprove. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate\npreviously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains.

However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter\nchallenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed\n(non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly\npronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature\ndistributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method\ndesigned to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic\nfeature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client\nclassifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature\nmanifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating\nthe construction of more distinct decision boundaries.

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation.

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D\nand Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation.

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner.

Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance.

Specifically, we designed a novel spiking\nneural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel\nLoihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation\nthat allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi\n2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and\ninstruction set of the hardware.

A key real-world challenge arises when a model\nperforms poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for\nanalysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot\" task,\nwhere effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant\nimprovement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,\ndeepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world\ndistributions.

Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,\nmimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be\ngathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,\neach test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is\nclassified based on the category of the nearest sample.

The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to\nmitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline\ncentered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets.

We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for\nmessage-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,\nsum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.\nExtensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and\nCiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its\nusability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to\nexisting {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5GNNev\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u5bf9\u6297\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "GNNs\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e38\u7528\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6536\u7d27\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u677e\u5f1b\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u6c42\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002\u652f\u6301sum\u3001max\u548cmean\u4e09\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Cora\u3001CiteSeer\u3001Amazon\u548cYelp\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GNNev\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728sum\u805a\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "GNNev\u4e3aGNNs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkySplat\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06RPC\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u51653D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u77ac\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "SkySplat\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408RPC\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u53c9\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff08CSCM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSkySplat\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\uff0886\u500d\u4e8eEOGS\uff09\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08MAE\u4ece13.18\u7c73\u964d\u81f31.80\u7c73\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SkySplat\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection.

Our model is pre-trained on heterogeneous,\nincomplete data and fine-tuned for glioma survival prediction using\nTCGA-GBM/LGG and BraTS datasets, integrating five modalities: genetic (DNAm,\nRNA-seq), imaging (MRI, WSI), and clinical data. By addressing missing data\nduring pre-training and enabling efficient resource utilization, impuTMAE\nsurpasses prior multimodal approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance\nin glioma patient survival prediction.

To address this, Meta Neural\nArchitecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that\nleverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones.\nNevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor\ngeneralization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS\nfirst models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy\nis developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural\narchitectures.

Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds\ndemonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage\ncompared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing\nexpert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability.\nFor large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE\nreduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on\nresource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support\nmuch smaller models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoMoE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5927\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u805a\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoMoE\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1170%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e10.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578bMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "CoMoE\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their\nratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images.

Extensive experiments under three\nevaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration\ndatasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP\nimprovements over state-of-the-art methods.

To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via\ndiagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language\nmodel with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a\ndiagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated\nsentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding\nmodule is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the\nworking efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we\npropose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to\nleverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead\nto 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a\nevaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion\nlocation and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist\nmodels consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by\naccurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u94fe\uff08CoD\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff08RRG\uff09\u4e2d\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0cCoD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u75c5\u7076\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u679c\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u75c5\u7076\u5c5e\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u96be\u4ee5\u4fe1\u4efb\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u8bca\u65ad\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u3001\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u75c5\u7076\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "CoD\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aRRG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u53e5\u5b50\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bca\u65ad\u94fe\u548c\u75c5\u7076\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment.

Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been\nexplored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student\nmodel by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference\ncost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the\nframework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's\nInequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into\nteacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and\nstrengthening knowledge transfer.

However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its\nintractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework\nfor efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a\nmeasurement of causality in state space, \\emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which\nrepresents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.\nAfter that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points\nin discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous\nhigh-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where\nthe agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded\nas our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and\nefficiently.

Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and\nunclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for\nfine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast\nFusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed\ninformation from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower\nlayers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By\nassigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast\nconditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining\nminimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature\nrepresentation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports\nclinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating\nstrong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening.

However, existing methods\noften evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the\nexponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative\nmodeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage\narchitecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse\nset of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with\nreinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine\nits selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a\nmulti-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as\nclicks, to the individual creative elements.

While machine learning models can\npredict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the\ndynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed\nand validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal\ncohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We\ndemonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has\nlimited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by\nengineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)\nof key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance.

Traditionally, experts propose significant features and\nevaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human\nbody and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the\nrelationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With\nadvancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods\nhave gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we\nleverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical\nfeatures from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.\nThe objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features\ncontributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of\nthese key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship\nbetween the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective\ndistance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the\nmodel, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial\nDependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots.

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does\nnot serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their\nmathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been\nestablished as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we\npropose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to\neffectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a\nregularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet.

Quantitative analysis of the\nmicrostructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are\nimplemented to the entire 3D image.

Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)\nabove 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time\nfrom ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers\nsubstantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also\nassess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling\ninference time, limiting its clinical practicality.

We evaluated\nMedPatch using real-world data consisting of clinical time-series data, chest\nX-ray images, radiology reports, and discharge notes extracted from the\nMIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, and MIMIC-Notes datasets on two benchmark tasks, namely\nin-hospital mortality prediction and clinical condition classification.\nCompared to existing baselines, MedPatch achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nOur work highlights the effectiveness of confidence-guided multi-stage fusion\nin addressing the heterogeneity of multimodal data, and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art benchmark results for clinical prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedPatch\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5757\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53d7\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "MedPatch\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMedPatch\u5728\u9662\u5185\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose NAPO\n(\\textbf{N}egative-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{P}reference \\textbf{O}ptimization),\nan enhanced framework for preference optimization in LLM-based recommendation.\nNAPO introduces two key innovations: (1) in-batch negative sharing, which\nexpands the pool of negative samples without additional memory overhead, and\n(2) dynamic reward margin adjustment, which adapts model updates based on the\nconfidence of negative samples. Extensive experiments on three public datasets\ndemonstrate that NAPO outperforms existing methods in both recommendation\naccuracy and popularity bias reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u6837\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6279\u5185\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u8fb9\u754c\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNAPO\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NAPO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The generated data are\nbelieved to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.\nTherefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or\nperforming Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space\nhelps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features\naffecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of\ngenerative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\ncombine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse\nprocess of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.\nIn some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for\neach dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each\ndimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different\ndimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs\nimpose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource\nconsumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different\ntemporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring\nthe priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel\nfunctions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent\ndimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs.

To provide a quantitative\nbasis for understanding these behaviours, we investigate the global dynamics of\nsuch automata and we describe a method that allows us to compute the number of\nall configurations leading to short attractors in a limited number of time\nsteps. This computation yields exact results in the thermodynamic limit (as the\nCA grid size grows to infinity), and is based on the Transfer Matrix Method\n(TMM) that we adapt for our purposes. Specifically, given two parameters $(p,\nc)$ we are able to compute the entropy of all initial configurations converging\nto an attractor of size $c$ after $p$ time-steps. By calculating such\nstatistics for various ECA rules, we establish a quantitative connection\nbetween the entropy and the qualitative Wolfram classification scheme. Class 1\nrules rapidly converge to maximal entropy for stationary states ($c=1$) as $p$\nincreases. Class 2 rules also approach maximal entropy quickly for appropriate\ncycle lengths $c$, potentially requiring consideration of translations. Class 3\nrules exhibit zero or low finite entropy that saturates after a short\ntransient. Class 4 rules show finite positive entropy, similar to some Class 3\nrules.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nTime-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for\nsynthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from\nnon-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a\nconditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and\ntemporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic\ntime-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase\ninformation flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth\nand physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a\nconstraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion\nclassification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further\nenhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent\nliver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification.

As code review\nnowadays is lightweight, various issues can be identified, and sometimes, they\ncan be trivial. Research has investigated automated approaches to classify\nreview comments to gauge the effectiveness of code reviews. However, previous\nstudies have primarily relied on supervised machine learning, which requires\nextensive manual annotation to train the models effectively. To address this\nlimitation, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nclassify code review comments. We assess the performance of LLMs to classify 17\ncategories of code review comments. Our results show that LLMs can classify\ncode review comments, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach using a\ntrained deep learning model. In particular, LLMs achieve better accuracy in\nclassifying the five most useful categories, which the state-of-the-art\napproach struggles with due to low training examples. Rather than relying\nsolely on a specific small training data distribution, our results show that\nLLMs provide balanced performance across high- and low-frequency categories.\nThese results suggest that the LLMs could offer a scalable solution for code\nreview analytics to improve the effectiveness of the code review process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLLMs\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8bc4\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002LLMs\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf917\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

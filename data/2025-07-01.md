### [1] [Bootstrapping Human-Like Planning via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22604)
*David Porfirio,Vincent Hsiao,Morgan Fine-Morris,Leslie Smith,Laura M. Hiatt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究结合自然语言编程和拖放界面，通过LLM生成人类类似的动作序列，并与手动指定的动作序列比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何结合自然语言编程的直观性和拖放界面的精确性，以提升机器人任务编程的效率和用户体验。

Method: 构建基于LLM的流程，输入自然语言并输出人类类似的动作序列，再与手动指定的动作序列进行比较。

Result: 较大模型在生成人类类似动作序列上表现更优，但较小模型也能达到满意效果。

Conclusion: 结合自然语言和拖放界面的方法可行，且模型规模对性能有影响。

Abstract: Robot end users increasingly require accessible means of specifying tasks for
robots to perform. Two common end-user programming paradigms include
drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language programming. Although natural
language interfaces harness an intuitive form of human communication,
drag-and-drop interfaces enable users to meticulously and precisely dictate the
key actions of the robot's task. In this paper, we investigate the degree to
which both approaches can be combined. Specifically, we construct a large
language model (LLM)-based pipeline that accepts natural language as input and
produces human-like action sequences as output, specified at a level of
granularity that a human would produce. We then compare these generated action
sequences to another dataset of hand-specified action sequences. Although our
results reveal that larger models tend to outperform smaller ones in the
production of human-like action sequences, smaller models nonetheless achieve
satisfactory performance.

### [2] [Ludax: A GPU-Accelerated Domain Specific Language for Board Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22609)
*Graham Todd,Alexander G. Padula,Dennis J. N. J. Soemers,Julian Togelius*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ludax是一个结合游戏描述语言和硬件加速的框架，旨在加速游戏研究，支持快速模拟和灵活表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏是人工智能研究的重要测试环境，但现有工具在通用性和速度上存在不足。Ludax旨在结合游戏描述语言的通用性和现代硬件加速的速度。

Method: Ludax是一个领域特定语言，自动编译为硬件加速代码，兼容深度学习流程，并提供详细的技术说明和速度测试。

Result: Ludax实现了快速模拟和灵活表示，支持强化学习代理训练，并开源了框架和现有棋盘游戏实现。

Conclusion: Ludax是一个通用且高效的框架，有望加速从强化学习到认知科学的游戏研究。

Abstract: Games have long been used as benchmarks and testing environments for research
in artificial intelligence. A key step in supporting this research was the
development of game description languages: frameworks that compile
domain-specific code into playable and simulatable game environments, allowing
researchers to generalize their algorithms and approaches across multiple games
without having to manually implement each one. More recently, progress in
reinforcement learning (RL) has been largely driven by advances in hardware
acceleration. Libraries like JAX allow practitioners to take full advantage of
cutting-edge computing hardware, often speeding up training and testing by
orders of magnitude. Here, we present a synthesis of these strands of research:
a domain-specific language for board games which automatically compiles into
hardware-accelerated code. Our framework, Ludax, combines the generality of
game description languages with the speed of modern parallel processing
hardware and is designed to fit neatly into existing deep learning pipelines.
We envision Ludax as a tool to help accelerate games research generally, from
RL to cognitive science, by enabling rapid simulation and providing a flexible
representation scheme. We present a detailed breakdown of Ludax's description
language and technical notes on the compilation process, along with speed
benchmarking and a demonstration of training RL agents. The Ludax framework,
along with implementations of existing board games, is open-source and freely
available.

### [3] [URSA: The Universal Research and Scientific Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22653)
*Michael Grosskopf,Russell Bent,Rahul Somasundaram,Isaac Michaud,Arthur Lui,Nathan Debardeleben,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: URSA是一个模块化科学代理生态系统，旨在加速研究任务，通过结合先进物理模拟代码等工具解决复杂科学问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）已具备复杂推理、规划、写作和编码能力，与科学家日常技能高度重合，有望通过“代理”AI革新科学研究。

Method: 提出URSA系统，包含模块化代理和工具（如物理模拟代码），可组合解决不同复杂度和影响力的科学问题。

Result: 展示了URSA的架构及其在科学问题中的潜力示例。

Conclusion: URSA展示了LLMs作为科学代理的潜力，有望推动研究进步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have moved far beyond their initial form as
simple chatbots, now carrying out complex reasoning, planning, writing, coding,
and research tasks. These skills overlap significantly with those that human
scientists use day-to-day to solve complex problems that drive the cutting edge
of research. Using LLMs in "agentic" AI has the potential to revolutionize
modern science and remove bottlenecks to progress. In this work, we present
URSA, a scientific agent ecosystem for accelerating research tasks. URSA
consists of a set of modular agents and tools, including coupling to advanced
physics simulation codes, that can be combined to address scientific problems
of varied complexity and impact. This work highlights the architecture of URSA,
as well as examples that highlight the potential of the system.

### [4] [Explanations are a means to an end](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22740)
*Jessica Hullman,Ziyang Guo,Berk Ustun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于统计决策理论的框架，强调解释性机器学习方法应针对具体用途设计和评估，并展示了其在临床决策支持等场景中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释性机器学习方法未充分考虑实际用途，需设计更实用的解释框架。

Method: 采用统计决策理论框架，明确解释的具体用途，并通过理论和实证结合评估解释的价值。

Result: 展示了框架在多种场景（如临床决策支持）中的应用，并量化了解释对理想决策者的性能提升。

Conclusion: 解释性方法应针对具体用途设计，理论和实证结合评估可防止滥用并提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern methods for explainable machine learning are designed to describe how
models map inputs to outputs--without deep consideration of how these
explanations will be used in practice. This paper argues that explanations
should be designed and evaluated with a specific end in mind. We describe how
to formalize this end in a framework based in statistical decision theory. We
show how this functionally-grounded approach can be applied across diverse use
cases, such as clinical decision support, providing recourse, or debugging. We
demonstrate its use to characterize the maximum "boost" in performance on a
particular task that an explanation could provide an idealized decision-maker,
preventing misuse due to ambiguity by forcing researchers to specify concrete
use cases that can be analyzed in light of models of expected explanation use.
We argue that evaluation should meld theoretical and empirical perspectives on
the value of explanation, and contribute definitions that span these
perspectives.

### [5] [Bridging Ethical Principles and Algorithmic Methods: An Alternative Approach for Assessing Trustworthiness in AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22774)
*Michael Papademas,Xenia Ziouvelou,Antonis Troumpoukis,Vangelis Karkaletsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合伦理与算法的评估方法，旨在量化AI系统的可信度，弥补现有指南与技术工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术的广泛应用及其潜在风险需要一种既能量化可信度又能保持整体视角的评估方法。

Method: 结合Trustworthy AI的伦理组件与PageRank和TrustRank的算法流程，提出新的评估框架。

Result: 该方法通过量化分析实现了对AI系统可信度的全面评估，同时考虑了伦理指南的理论内容。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI系统的可信度评估提供了一种更客观、全面的方法，减少了主观性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology epitomizes the complex challenges
posed by human-made artifacts, particularly those widely integrated into
society and exert significant influence, highlighting potential benefits and
their negative consequences. While other technologies may also pose substantial
risks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The
complexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead
to a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or
understanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and
guidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools
aimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view
of the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.
Conversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such
quantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific
aspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method
that combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic
processes of PageRank and TrustRank. The goal is to establish an assessment
framework that minimizes the subjectivity inherent in the self-assessment
techniques prevalent in the field by introducing algorithmic criteria. The
application of our approach indicates that a holistic assessment of an AI
system's trustworthiness can be achieved by providing quantitative insights
while considering the theoretical content of relevant guidelines.

### [6] [ReasonBridge: Efficient Reasoning Transfer from Closed to Open-Source Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22865)
*Ziqi Zhong,Xunzhu Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasonBridge通过分层知识蒸馏框架，将闭源模型的推理能力高效迁移到开源模型，显著缩小性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决闭源与开源模型在复杂推理和指令遵循任务中的性能差距。

Method: 采用分层蒸馏、稀疏推理适配器和测试时计算扩展机制，使用精心筛选的Reason1K数据集。

Result: 开源模型推理能力提升23%，Qwen2.5-14B在MATH500上超越Claude-Sonnet3.5。

Conclusion: ReasonBridge为推理能力增强提供了一种样本高效的方法，适用于多种推理领域和模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed a
significant performance gap between closed-source and open-source models,
particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and precise instruction
following. This paper introduces ReasonBridge, a methodology that efficiently
transfers reasoning capabilities from powerful closed-source to open-source
models through a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. We
develop a tailored dataset Reason1K with only 1,000 carefully curated reasoning
traces emphasizing difficulty, diversity, and quality. These traces are
filtered from across multiple domains using a structured multi-criteria
selection algorithm. Our transfer learning approach incorporates: (1) a
hierarchical distillation process capturing both strategic abstraction and
tactical implementation patterns, (2) a sparse reasoning-focused adapter
architecture requiring only 0.3% additional trainable parameters, and (3) a
test-time compute scaling mechanism using guided inference interventions.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ReasonBridge improves reasoning
capabilities in open-source models by up to 23% on benchmark tasks,
significantly narrowing the gap with closed-source models. Notably, the
enhanced Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Claude-Sonnet3.5 on MATH500 and matches its
performance on competition-level AIME problems. Our methodology generalizes
effectively across diverse reasoning domains and model architectures,
establishing a sample-efficient approach to reasoning enhancement for
instruction following.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI在企业决策中的潜力，提出了以用户为中心的AI六大原则，并强调市场机制的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在多个领域具有潜力，但当前AI中心化的用户范式未能满足企业决策的持续需求，因此需要转向以用户为中心的AI。

Method: 通过分析企业决策需求，提出六大原则，并建议通过市场机制设计AI代理。

Result: 强调了以用户为中心的AI对企业决策的重要性，并提供了具体原则和实施建议。

Conclusion: 转向以用户为中心的AI和利用市场机制可以提升企业决策效率，满足实际需求。

Abstract: After a very long winter, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) spring is here.
Or, so it seems over the last three years. AI has the potential to impact many
areas of human life - personal, social, health, education, professional. In
this paper, we take a closer look at the potential of AI for Enterprises, where
decision-making plays a crucial and repeated role across functions, tasks, and
operations. We consider Agents imbued with AI as means to increase
decision-productivity of enterprises. We highlight six tenets for Agentic
success in enterprises, by drawing attention to what the current, AI-Centric
User paradigm misses, in the face of persistent needs of and usefulness for
Enterprise Decision-Making. In underscoring a shift to User-Centric AI, we
offer six tenets and promote market mechanisms for platforms, aligning the
design of AI and its delivery by Agents to the cause of enterprise users.

### [8] [Hecto: Modular Sparse Experts for Adaptive and Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22919)
*Sanskar Pandey,Ruhaan Chopra,Saad Murtaza Bhat,Ark Abhyudaya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hecto是一种轻量级的MoE架构，通过结合GRU和FFNN专家实现异构计算，提升推理任务的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型的静态计算路径限制了表示多样性和推理效率，Hecto旨在通过异构架构解决这一问题。

Method: Hecto结合GRU专家（时序推理）和FFNN专家（静态抽象），采用稀疏Top-1门控机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Hecto性能接近或优于同质基线，专家分工明确（时序vs静态），且在大批量时表现更优。

Conclusion: Hecto为条件计算设定了新基准，通过异构架构在低资源场景下实现高效推理和可解释性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable conditional computation by routing
inputs to specialized experts, but these experts rely on identical inductive
biases, thus limiting representational diversity. This static computation
pathway is inefficient for inputs that require different types of reasoning and
limits specialization and interpretability. We propose Hecto, a lightweight MoE
architecture that leverages architectural heterogeneity by combining a GRU
expert for temporal reasoning and an FFNN expert for static abstraction under a
sparse Top-1 gating mechanism. Evaluated on three reasoning benchmarks (AG
News, SST-2, HotpotQA) and a regression task (STS-B), Hecto matches or closely
trails homogeneous baselines in performance despite receiving isolated input
representations, while achieving clear expert specialization, with each expert
aligning to distinct reasoning types (temporal vs static). At larger batch
sizes, Hecto exhibits improved performance, benefiting from relaxed
computational constraints that allow its heterogeneous architecture to optimize
more effectively. Ablation results isolate architectural diversity as the
source of Hecto's stability and interpretability across diverse reasoning
tasks. Overall, Hecto establishes itself as a new benchmark for conditional
computation, offering a principled framework for specialized reasoning in
low-resource regimes with its model strength derived from principled
specialization.

### [9] [Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22920)
*Pinzheng Wang,Juntao Li,Zecheng Tang,Haijia Gui,Min zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过自玩游戏（Critic-Discernment Game）提升大语言模型的推理理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在推理任务中缺乏对其推理过程的真正理解，需要无监督方法提升其理性。

Method: 设计Critic-Discernment Game（CDG），模型在游戏中作为证明者接受批评或误导性反馈，目标是保持正确或修正错误。

Result: 实验表明，CDG训练显著提升了模型在数学推理、错误检测、自我修正和长链推理中的能力。

Conclusion: 自玩游戏CDG能有效增强大语言模型对其推理过程的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning
abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent
studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their
reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the
rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans
or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover
first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by
critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the
prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when
faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to
constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical
reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning
demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of
well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.

### [10] [MARBLE: A Hard Benchmark for Multimodal Spatial Reasoning and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22992)
*Yulun Jiang,Yekun Chai,Maria Brbić,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准测试，旨在评估多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，表明复杂推理仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注文本推理或简单多模态问题，复杂多模态推理能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: MARBLE包含两个高难度任务（M-Portal和M-Cube），要求模型在空间、视觉和物理约束下进行多步规划。

Result: 12个先进模型在M-Portal上表现接近随机，M-Cube上准确率为0%，仅在某些简化子任务中优于随机基线。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs在复杂多模态推理中的局限性，感知仍是瓶颈，未来需开发能跨多模态推理的新模型。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

Conclusion: AURA是首个支持复杂任务的开源语音助手，性能接近商业系统。

Abstract: Despite advances in language and speech technologies, no open-source system
enables full speech-to-speech, multi-turn dialogue with integrated tool use and
agentic reasoning. We introduce AURA (Agent for Understanding, Reasoning, and
Automated Tool Use), the first open-source, speech-native assistant capable of
completing complex, goal-driven tasks through dynamic tool invocation and
multi-turn conversation. AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a
cascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup,
web search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools
using natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores
92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing
GPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems.
Human evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.

*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个五阶段的AI进化框架，类比人类认知技术的发展，解释了AI从专家系统到Transformers的演变，并预测了未来的发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的发展轨迹，提供一个跨学科的系统模型，解释其历史演变并指导未来研究。

Method: 提出“认知几何”框架，将AI发展分为五个阶段，每个阶段对应一种革命性的表示和推理能力提升。

Result: 展示了AI的进化是自反的，当前处于“元语言时刻”，未来将进入“数学符号时刻”和“形式逻辑系统时刻”。

Conclusion: 为未来AI研究提供了理论基础和实用策略，特别是针对下一代智能系统的开发。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive five-stage evolutionary framework for
understanding the development of artificial intelligence, arguing that its
trajectory mirrors the historical progression of human cognitive technologies.
We posit that AI is advancing through distinct epochs, each defined by a
revolutionary shift in its capacity for representation and reasoning, analogous
to the inventions of cuneiform, the alphabet, grammar and logic, mathematical
calculus, and formal logical systems. This "Geometry of Cognition" framework
moves beyond mere metaphor to provide a systematic, cross-disciplinary model
that not only explains AI's past architectural shifts-from expert systems to
Transformers-but also charts a concrete and prescriptive path forward.
Crucially, we demonstrate that this evolution is not merely linear but
reflexive: as AI advances through these stages, the tools and insights it
develops create a feedback loop that fundamentally reshapes its own underlying
architecture. We are currently transitioning into a "Metalinguistic Moment,"
characterized by the emergence of self-reflective capabilities like
Chain-of-Thought prompting and Constitutional AI. The subsequent stages, the
"Mathematical Symbolism Moment" and the "Formal Logic System Moment," will be
defined by the development of a computable calculus of thought, likely through
neuro-symbolic architectures and program synthesis, culminating in provably
aligned and reliable AI that reconstructs its own foundational representations.
This work serves as the methodological capstone to our trilogy, which
previously explored the economic drivers ("why") and cognitive nature ("what")
of AI. Here, we address the "how," providing a theoretical foundation for
future research and offering concrete, actionable strategies for startups and
developers aiming to build the next generation of intelligent systems.

### [13] [Can Large Language Models Capture Human Risk Preferences? A Cross-Cultural Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23107)
*Bing Song,Jianing Liu,Sisi Jian,Chenyang Wu,Vinayak Dixit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟风险决策行为中的表现，发现模型比人类更风险规避，且中文提示下的预测偏差更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs应用的扩展，其模拟复杂决策行为的可靠性引发关注，尤其是风险决策场景。

Method: 通过彩票任务比较ChatGPT 4o和o1-mini的预测与人类实际选择，使用CRRA框架分析风险偏好。

Result: 模型比人类更风险规避，o1-mini更接近人类行为；中文提示下的预测偏差更大。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类风险行为方面有潜力，但在语言和文化背景下仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides, extending their
applications to dialogue systems, automated content creation, and
domain-specific advisory tasks. However, as their use grows, concerns have
emerged regarding their reliability in simulating complex decision-making
behavior, such as risky decision-making, where a single choice can lead to
multiple outcomes. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate
risky decision-making scenarios. We compare model-generated decisions with
actual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation
stated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,
and Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and
ChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk
preferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)
framework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than
human participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human
decisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong
indicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses
compared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation
performance. These findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of LLMs in replicating human-like risk behavior, particularly in
linguistic and cultural settings.

*Zihao Liu,Xinhang Sui,Yueran Song,Siwen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PokéAI是一个基于文本的多智能体大型语言模型框架，用于自主玩Pokémon Red游戏，包含规划、执行和评估三个智能体，初步测试显示战斗模块表现接近人类玩家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够自主玩Pokémon Red的多智能体LLM框架，探索语言能力与战略推理之间的联系。

Method: 系统由三个智能体组成：规划（生成任务）、执行（完成任务）、评估（验证结果），形成闭环决策系统。

Result: 战斗模块在50次野生遭遇战中平均胜率为80.8%，接近人类玩家水平，且模型的语言能力与战斗表现相关。

Conclusion: PokéAI展示了LLM在游戏中的潜力，智能体表现出独特的策略行为，语言能力与战略推理相关。

Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model
(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon
Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and
Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent
functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.
These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out
within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates
the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once
verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a
closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution
Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of
80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an
experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle
performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related
tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic
reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM
exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct

Result: 通过科学基础和政策研究接口，为AI治理提供支持。

Conclusion: 本研究为AI时代的社会治理奠定了基础，促进更好的社会成果。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is humanity's most promising technology because of
the remarkable capabilities offered by foundation models. Yet, the same
technology brings confusion and consternation: foundation models are poorly
understood and they may precipitate a wide array of harms. This dissertation
explains how technology and society coevolve in the age of AI, organized around
three themes. First, the conceptual framing: the capabilities, risks, and the
supply chain that grounds foundation models in the broader economy. Second, the
empirical insights that enrich the conceptual foundations: transparency created
via evaluations at the model level and indexes at the organization level.
Finally, the transition from understanding to action: superior understanding of
the societal impact of foundation models advances evidence-based AI policy.
View together, this dissertation makes inroads into achieving better societal
outcomes in the age of AI by building the scientific foundations and
research-policy interface required for better AI governance.

TL;DR: MAPF-GPT-DDG是一种基于机器学习的多智能体路径规划（MAPF）求解器，通过微调预训练模型和创新的增量数据生成机制，显著提升了性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人轨迹规划中的NP-hard问题，为物流、搜救等实际应用提供高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 利用集中式专家数据微调预训练的MAPF模型，并引入增量数据生成机制加速训练。

Result: MAPF-GPT-DDG在测试场景中表现优于现有学习型求解器，支持单环境中多达100万个智能体的路径规划。

Conclusion: MAPF-GPT-DDG在多智能体路径规划领域实现了性能和可扩展性的新突破。

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot
trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously
move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to
be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world
applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized
suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage.
Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation
learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively
fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging
a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training
while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF
solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across
many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving
up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for
scalability in MAPF domains.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在深度关系推理任务中的能力，并比较不同模型的性能。

Method: 通过精心设计的家族树和通用图推理基准任务，评估三种模型的推理能力。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在多个任务中表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂任务中表现不佳，主要受限于输出结构和推理不完整。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在复杂推理中的局限性，并提出了未来改进方向，如多模态推理和系统化分析推理失败。

Abstract: How far are Large Language Models (LLMs) in performing deep relational
reasoning? In this paper, we evaluate and compare the reasoning capabilities of
three cutting-edge LLMs, namely, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o, through a
suite of carefully designed benchmark tasks in family tree and general graph
reasoning. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 consistently achieves the
highest F1-scores across multiple tasks and problem sizes, demonstrating strong
aptitude in logical deduction and relational inference. However, all evaluated
models, including DeepSeek-R1, struggle significantly as problem complexity
increases, largely due to token length limitations and incomplete output
structures. A detailed analysis of DeepSeek-R1's long Chain-of-Thought
responses uncovers its unique planning and verification strategies, but also
highlights instances of incoherent or incomplete reasoning, calling attention
to the need for deeper scrutiny into LLMs' internal inference dynamics. We
further discuss key directions for future work, including the role of
multimodal reasoning and the systematic examination of reasoning failures. Our
findings provide both empirical insights and theoretical implications for
advancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks that demand
structured, multi-step logical inference. Our code repository will be publicly

Motivation: 传统节点消息传递机制在知识图谱中会引入噪声或信息稀释，影响预测准确性。

Method: 采用语义感知的Top-K邻居选择策略和多头注意力聚合器，选择最相关的邻居信息进行聚合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了无关信息的干扰，提升了知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Semantic context surrounding a triplet $(h, r, t)$ is crucial for Knowledge
Graph Completion (KGC), providing vital cues for prediction. However,
traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge
graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or
over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring
edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational
message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a
\textbf{semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy}. Specifically, this
strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its
incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most
pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is
effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a
\textbf{multi-head attention aggregator} to generate a semantically focused
node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and
features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures
and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link
prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches on several established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 在形式概念分析（FCA）中，格通常表现出高度分配性，但缺乏标准化的量化方法。

Method: 引入rises概念，分析覆盖概念中属性或对象数量的变化，并与经典的分配性概念关联。

Result: 证明格分配性当且仅当无非单位rises；实际数据的概念格多为join-distributive，但meet-distributive较少。

Conclusion: rises是量化分配性的有效工具，实际数据中join-distributivity表现显著。

Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in
lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal
Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of
distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this
property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices
as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes
or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that
a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore,
we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We
observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree
join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how
join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.

Result: 发现四种行为模式：持续高合作、波动合作、逐渐衰退合作和固定策略。推理能力强的LLMs合作表现较差，传统LLMs反而更稳定。

Conclusion: 当前提升LLMs推理能力的方法未必促进合作，对需要持续协作的环境部署LLMs有重要启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

Result: 实验表明，GATSim代理能产生可信的旅行行为，并在宏观交通模式上与人类表现相当。

Conclusion: GATSim为城市交通模拟提供了更真实和动态的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations rely on rigid rule-based
systems that fail to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral
diversity characteristic of human travel decision-making. Recent advances in
large language models and AI agent technology offer opportunities to create
agents with reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning
mechanisms. We propose GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel
framework that leverages these advances to create generative agents with rich
behavioral characteristics for urban mobility simulation. Unlike conventional
approaches, GATSim agents possess diverse socioeconomic attributes, individual
lifestyles, and evolving preferences that shape their mobility decisions
through psychologically-informed memory systems, tool usage capabilities, and
lifelong learning mechanisms. The main contributions of this study include: (1)
a comprehensive architecture combining an urban mobility foundation model with
agent cognitive systems and transport simulation environment, (2) a fully
functional prototype implementation, and (3) systematic validation
demonstrating that generative agents produce believable travel behaviors.
Through designed reflection processes, generative agents in this study can
transform specific travel experiences into generalized insights, enabling
realistic behavioral adaptation over time with specialized mechanisms for
activity planning and real-time reactive behaviors tailored to urban mobility
contexts. Experiments show that generative agents perform competitively with
human annotators in mobility scenarios while naturally producing macroscopic
traffic evolution patterns. The code for the prototype system is shared at

TL;DR: HonestVQA是一个自监督的诚实校准框架，旨在解决DocVQA系统中的伦理问题，通过量化不确定性和对齐模型置信度，提升准确性和伦理响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DocVQA系统在伦理上不透明，常产生过度自信的答案或未能可信地传达不确定性，这在需要伦理问责的领域存在风险。

Method: HonestVQA采用模型无关的方法，通过加权损失函数对齐模型置信度与正确性，并通过对比学习强制伦理响应行为。

Result: HonestVQA在多个数据集上提升了DocVQA的准确性和F1分数，同时降低了过度自信，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: HonestVQA通过伦理对齐和不确定性量化，显著提升了DocVQA系统的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) systems are increasingly deployed
in real world applications, yet they remain ethically opaque-often producing
overconfident answers to ambiguous questions or failing to communicate
uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. This misalignment between model confidence
and actual knowledge poses significant risks, particularly in domains requiring
ethical accountability. Existing approaches such as LayoutLMv3, UDOP, and DONUT
have advanced SOTA performance by focusing on architectural sophistication and
accuracy; however, they fall short in ethical responsiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce HonestVQA, a self-supervised
honesty calibration framework for ethically aligned DocVQA. Our model-agnostic
method quantifies uncertainty to identify knowledge gaps, aligns model
confidence with actual correctness using weighted loss functions, and enforces
ethical response behavior via contrastive learning. We further introduce two
principled evaluation metrics--Honesty Score (H-Score) and Ethical Confidence
Index (ECI)--to benchmark alignment between confidence, accuracy, and ethical
communication. Empirically, HonestVQA improves DocVQA accuracy by up to 4.3%
and F1 by 4.3% across SpDocVQA, InfographicsVQA, and SROIE datasets. It reduces
overconfidence, lowering H-Score and ECI by 0.072 and 0.078, respectively. In
cross domain evaluation, it achieves up to 78.9% accuracy and 76.1% F1-score,
demonstrating strong generalization. Ablation shows a 3.8% drop in accuracy
without alignment or contrastive loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分析社交媒体中的认知路径方面存在不足，无法为心理治疗师提供及时有效的干预工具。

Method: 结合CBT框架，使用BERT、RoBERTa进行情感分析，T5、PEGASUS进行文本摘要，mT5进行多语言翻译，以检测负面情绪和认知扭曲。

Result: 系统不仅能识别负面思维，还能预测潜在心理健康问题（如恐惧症、进食障碍），提供更全面的干预策略。

Conclusion: 该系统为心理治疗师提供了早期检测和治疗心理问题的强大工具。

Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a proven approach for addressing the
irrational thought patterns associated with mental health disorders, but its
effectiveness relies on accurately identifying cognitive pathways to provide
targeted treatment. In today's digital age, individuals often express negative
emotions on social media, where they may reveal cognitive distortions, and in
severe cases, exhibit suicidal tendencies. However, there is a significant gap
in methodologies designed to analyze these cognitive pathways, which could be
critical for psychotherapists aiming to deliver timely and effective
interventions in online environments. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
framework leveraging acceptance, commitment and data augmentation to categorize
and address both textual and visual content as positive or negative.
Specifically, the system employs BERT, RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis and T5,
PEGASUS for Text Summarization, mT5 for Text Translation in Multiple Languages
focusing on detecting negative emotions and cognitive distortions within social
media data. While existing models are primarily designed to identify negative
thoughts, the proposed system goes beyond this by predicting additional
negative side effects and other potential mental health disorders likes
Phobias, Eating Disorders. This enhancement allows for a more comprehensive
understanding and intervention strategy, offering psychotherapists a powerful
tool for early detection and treatment of various psychological issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注需求和价格，无法充分分析时间序列数据，导致预测不准确。

Method: 结合AlexNet的特征提取能力和LSTM的序列学习能力，引入外部变量（如温度、阳光、降雨等），并采用最小-最大缩放和时间窗口技术。

Result: 混合模型预测准确率达到97.08%，高于RNN（96.64%）和ANN（96.63%）。

Conclusion: 该混合模型在电价预测中表现出更高的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: The recent development of advanced machine learning methods for hybrid models
has greatly addressed the need for the correct prediction of electrical prices.
This method combines AlexNet and LSTM algorithms, which are used to introduce a
new model with higher accuracy in price forecasting. Despite RNN and ANN being
effective, they often fail to deal with forex time sequence data. The
traditional methods do not accurately forecast the prices. These traditional
methods only focus on demand and price which leads to insufficient analysis of
data. To address this issue, using the hybrid approach, which focuses on
external variables that also effect the predicted prices. Nevertheless, due to
AlexNet's excellent feature extraction and LSTM's learning sequential patterns,
the prediction accuracy is vastly increased. The model is built on the past
data, which has been supplied with the most significant elements like demand,
temperature, sunlight, and rain. For example, the model applies methods, such
as minimum-maximum scaling and a time window, to predict the electricity prices
of the future. The results show that this hybrid model is good than the
standalone ones in terms of accuracy. Although we got our accuracy rating of
97.08, it shows higher accompaniments than remaining models RNN and ANN with
accuracies of 96.64 and 96.63 respectively.

Motivation: 研究AI检测工具（如GPTZero）在识别不同长度AI生成文本时的可靠性。

Method: 收集28篇AI生成和50篇人类写作的随机文章，用GPTZero检测AI生成比例和置信度。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高（91-100%），人类文本存在误判。

Conclusion: GPTZero对纯AI文本有效，但需谨慎用于人类文本检测。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

Motivation: 随着机器人合成在有机化学中的兴趣增加，从文献中自动提取化学步骤变得至关重要，但化学语言的模糊性和人工标注的高成本使得这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出ChemActor，一个完全微调的LLM，结合数据选择模块和多轮LLM循环评估指标，生成机器可执行的动作序列。

Conclusion: ChemActor通过LLM生成的数据框架和创新的评估方法，显著提升了化学步骤自动提取的准确性和效率。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in robotic synthesis in the context of organic
chemistry, the automated extraction of chemical procedures from literature is
critical. However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity
of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for
developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present
ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical
executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured
action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to
address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This
framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on
distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate
machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we
introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the
model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive
experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)
tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%. The code

Result: 在Overcooked基准测试中显著优于基线方法，人类评估也证实其高效协作能力。

Conclusion: CooT框架在多智能体场景中表现出鲁棒性、灵活性和对上下文的高度敏感性。

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain
environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize
poorly to unseen partners or require extensive training. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (CooT), a novel in-context
coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to adapt to
unseen partners rapidly. Unlike previous approaches that primarily aim to
increase the diversity of training partners, CooT explicitly focuses on
adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed
partner interactions. Trained on interaction trajectories collected from
diverse pairs of agents with complementary behaviors, CooT quickly learns
effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or fine-tuning.
Evaluations on the Overcooked benchmark demonstrate that CooT significantly
outperforms baseline methods in coordination tasks involving previously unseen
partners. Human evaluations further confirm CooT as the most effective
collaborative partner, while extensive ablations highlight its robustness,
flexibility, and sensitivity to context in multi-agent scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准在评估长链推理能力时存在不足，包括缺乏难度和多样性、易受猜测和记忆影响，以及对中间推理步骤评估不足。

Method: MMReason通过以下方式设计：1）从多个领域和难度级别收集需要多步推理的问题；2）将问题转化为开放形式，并使用多模型投票技术过滤；3）标注详细的分步解决方案，并设计基于参考的三元评分机制。

Result: MMReason对流行的MLLMs进行了基准测试，并深入分析了它们的推理能力。

Conclusion: MMReason有望成为推动MLLM推理研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 多代理LLM系统能增强对越狱攻击的防御，但存在误报和计算开销的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多代理LLM系统作为防御越狱攻击的有效性。

Method: 评估三种越狱策略，比较单代理与多代理配置的效果。

Result: 多代理系统提升防御能力，但效果因攻击类型而异，且增加误报和计算开销。

Conclusion: 当前自动防御存在局限，需改进未来LLM系统的对齐鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about
jailbreaking attacks, i.e., prompts that bypass safety mechanisms. This paper
investigates the use of multi-agent LLM systems as a defence against such
attacks. We evaluate three jailbreaking strategies, including the original
AutoDefense attack and two from Deepleaps: BetterDan and JB. Reproducing the
AutoDefense framework, we compare single-agent setups with two- and three-agent
configurations. Our results show that multi-agent systems enhance resistance to
jailbreaks, especially by reducing false negatives. However, its effectiveness
varies by attack type, and it introduces trade-offs such as increased false
positives and computational overhead. These findings point to the limitations
of current automated defences and suggest directions for improving alignment
robustness in future LLM systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言模型的自动化方法，用于迭代调整强化学习代理的奖励函数权重，解决了游戏内容或机制变化时手动调整的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署强化学习代理时，手动设计奖励函数需要专家，且游戏内容变化时需重新调整权重，效率低下。

Method: 利用语言模型根据用户定义的行为目标和历史性能统计，迭代提出更新的奖励权重，形成闭环优化过程。

Result: 在赛车任务中，语言模型引导的代理性能从9%提升到74%，最终达到80%成功率，接近专家手动调整的94%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动奖励工程，能自动优化代理行为，性能接近专家水平。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in
recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can
transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in
production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective
reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content
or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be
optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for
iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a
user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes
updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary
of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process
allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing
increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering.
We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently
improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a
significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just
one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual
weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent
achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time
steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$
success, and $850$ time steps.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层适应框架（HASD）来解决病理学AI中的切片级域偏移问题，通过多尺度特征一致性和计算高效的适应方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学数据受中心特定条件影响严重，现有方法仅关注图像块而非全切片图像（WSI），无法满足临床需求。

Method: HASD框架包含分层适应（域级对齐、切片级几何不变性正则化、块级注意力一致性正则化）和原型选择机制。

Result: 在两个任务中，HER2分级AUROC提升4.1%，UCEC生存预测C-index提升3.9%。

Conclusion: HASD为病理学机构提供了一种实用且可靠的切片级域适应解决方案，降低了计算和标注成本。

Abstract: Domain shift is a critical problem for pathology AI as pathology data is
heavily influenced by center-specific conditions. Current pathology domain
adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to
capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this
work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a
Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD
achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient
slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical
adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for
feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to
preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency
Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype
selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method
on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC
improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in
a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable
slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing
both computational and annotation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在复杂问题中表现优异，但在安全关键系统中缺乏安全保障，亟需跨学科方法解决。

Method: 提出数据控制的新视角，结合系统理论和AI工程，通过安全分析和保障提升AI安全性。

Result: 提出了一种通用的安全分析框架，适用于特定AI系统和未来创新。

Conclusion: 跨学科的数据控制方法为AI安全性提供了新思路，有望推动AI工程的发展。

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering
increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety
assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of
safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a
new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While
data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control
systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety.
Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an
interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and
the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system
analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to
as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing
safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm
of data control. Following a top-down approach, a generic foundation for safety
analysis and assurance is outlined at an abstract level that can be refined for
specific AI systems and applications and is prepared for future innovation.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important measures to evaluate safety and compliance of AI
models at scale. However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and
lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to
verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data
even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses
verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks. We build a
prototype demonstrating feasibility on typical audit benchmarks against

Result: 在变量最多出现一次的基准测试中，新框架优于现有字符串求解器。

Conclusion: GNN在词方程求解中具有潜力，能有效提升求解效率。

Abstract: Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by
repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are
rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word
equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably
on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving
process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word
equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts,
enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable
number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to
the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done
with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The
experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers,
the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable
appears at most once in each equation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of
autonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,
open-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from
static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these
capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also
introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool
misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the
threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we
first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin
increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,
modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze
the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying
failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and
deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.
These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across
perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,
we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different
autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,
constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective
reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a
unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes
(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,
and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety
across the agent's decision-making loop.

Method: 提出从统计性能优化转向精确学习范式，要求对所有输入的正确性。

Result: 认为精确学习是实现可靠演绎推理的关键。

Conclusion: 精确学习是必要的且可行的，应成为算法设计的指导目标。

Abstract: Sound deductive reasoning -- the ability to derive new knowledge from
existing facts and rules -- is an indisputably desirable aspect of general
intelligence. Despite the major advances of AI systems in areas such as math
and science, especially since the introduction of transformer architectures, it
is well-documented that even the most advanced frontier systems regularly and
consistently falter on easily-solvable deductive reasoning tasks. Hence, these
systems are unfit to fulfill the dream of achieving artificial general
intelligence capable of sound deductive reasoning. We argue that their unsound
behavior is a consequence of the statistical learning approach powering their
development. To overcome this, we contend that to achieve reliable deductive
reasoning in learning-based AI systems, researchers must fundamentally shift
from optimizing for statistical performance against distributions on reasoning
problems and algorithmic tasks to embracing the more ambitious exact learning
paradigm, which demands correctness on all inputs. We argue that exact learning
is both essential and possible, and that this ambitious objective should guide
algorithm design.

Conclusion: LLMs在运筹学中具有潜力，可辅助研究并推动自动化应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited expert-level capabilities across
various domains. However, their abilities to solve problems in Operations
Research (OR) -- the analysis and optimization of mathematical models derived
from real-world problems or their verbal descriptions -- remain underexplored.
In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating LLMs' abilities to solve
stochastic modeling problems, a core class of OR problems characterized by
uncertainty and typically involving tools from probability, statistics, and
stochastic processes. We manually procure a representative set of
graduate-level homework and doctoral qualification-exam problems and test LLMs'
abilities to solve them. We further leverage SimOpt, an open-source library of
simulation-optimization problems and solvers, to investigate LLMs' abilities to
make real-world decisions under uncertainty. Our results show that, though a
nontrivial amount of work is still needed to reliably automate the stochastic
modeling pipeline in reality, state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate proficiency on
par with human experts in both classroom and practical settings. These findings
highlight the potential of building AI agents that assist OR researchers and
amplify the real-world impact of OR through automation.

Abstract: Resilience non-equilibrium measurement, the ability to maintain fundamental
functionality amidst failures and errors, is crucial for scientific management
and engineering applications of industrial chain. The problem is particularly
challenging when the number or types of multiple co-evolution of resilience
(for example, randomly placed) are extremely chaos. Existing end-to-end deep
learning ordinarily do not generalize well to unseen full-feld reconstruction
of spatiotemporal co-evolution structure, and predict resilience of network
topology, especially in multiple chaos data regimes typically seen in
real-world applications. To address this challenge, here we propose industrial
brain, a human-like autonomous cognitive decision-making and planning framework
integrating higher-order activity-driven neuro network and CT-OODA symbolic
reasoning to autonomous plan resilience directly from observational data of
global variable. The industrial brain not only understands and model structure
of node activity dynamics and network co-evolution topology without simplifying
assumptions, and reveal the underlying laws hidden behind complex networks, but
also enabling accurate resilience prediction, inference, and planning.
Experimental results show that industrial brain significantly outperforms
resilience prediction and planning methods, with an accurate improvement of up
to 10.8\% over GoT and OlaGPT framework and 11.03\% over spectral dimension
reduction. It also generalizes to unseen topologies and dynamics and maintains
robust performance despite observational disturbances. Our findings suggest
that industrial brain addresses an important gap in resilience prediction and
planning for industrial chain.

Abstract: In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest
as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement
Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement
and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing
benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision
algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we
have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we
established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of
non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence
relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel
perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further
introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the
History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the
state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our
analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad
range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and
flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings
where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.

TL;DR: SPIRAL是一种通过自我对弈框架训练语言模型的强化学习方法，无需人工监督，能够生成无限难度递增的问题，显著提升模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的强化学习方法依赖人工标注的问题-答案对和领域特定的奖励设计，SPIRAL旨在通过自我对弈消除这些限制，实现自主推理能力的提升。

Method: SPIRAL采用多轮、零和游戏的自我对弈框架，结合在线多智能体强化学习系统和角色条件优势估计（RAE）来稳定训练。

Result: 实验显示，SPIRAL在Kuhn Poker等游戏中训练的模型在数学和通用推理任务上分别提升8.6%和8.4%，多游戏训练进一步增强了性能。

Conclusion: 零和游戏能自然发展出可迁移的推理能力，SPIRAL为自主推理开发提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在心理语言学数据集上的对齐程度，发现LLMs在感知相关特征上的对齐较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估多关注任务性能，但忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如情感、感知等）。本文利用心理语言学数据集填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Glasgow和Lancaster两个心理语言学数据集，评估LLMs在13个语言特征上与人类评分的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow数据集（情感、熟悉度等）上对齐较好，但在Lancaster数据集（感知相关特征）上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在感知相关特征上的局限性可能源于缺乏具身认知，心理语言学数据集为LLM评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [47] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模块化多智能体系统，用于自动化审核高度结构化的企业业务文档，利用AI智能体实现准确性、一致性、完整性和清晰性的逐节评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要关注非结构化文本或有限的合规性检查，无法满足企业文档的高效审核需求。

Method: 使用LangChain、CrewAI、TruLens和Guidance等现代编排工具，通过并行或顺序运行的专门智能体进行文档审核。

Result: AI系统在信息一致性（99% vs 人类92%）、错误和偏见率减半、审核时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟等方面表现优于人类。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但仍需在高度专业化领域进行人工监督。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用多个小型语言模型验证大型语言模型（LLM）生成回答的框架，通过分解回答并利用生成“Yes”标记的概率检测幻觉，实验表明F1分数提高了10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在问答任务中可能产生幻觉，缺乏真实数据时难以检测，影响可靠性。

Method: 集成多个小型语言模型，分解回答为单句，利用生成“Yes”标记的概率验证回答。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，F1分数提高了10%，能检测完全或部分正确的回答。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可有效验证LLM回答，为学术和实际应用提供可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptAug，一种基于LLM的数据增强方法，用于解决社交媒体冲突检测中高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，并在准确率和F1分数上提升了2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突检测需要高质量标注数据，但这类数据稀缺且昂贵。同时，LLM的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug方法，利用LLM进行数据增强，并通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确率和F1分数提升。主题分析揭示了增强文本中的四种问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug是一种有效的敏感任务数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法进行跨学科评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

TL;DR: AgentStealth是一种基于本地小型语言模型（SLM）的文本匿名化框架，通过对抗性工作流和强化学习提升匿名化效果和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本匿名化方法在实用性和隐私保护上的不足，避免依赖成本高且隐私风险大的云端大模型。

Method: 结合上下文对比学习和自适应效用感知控制的对抗性工作流，利用高质量数据监督训练SLM，并通过在线强化学习迭代优化。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，且支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth提供了一种高效、轻量级的文本匿名化解决方案，兼顾隐私保护和实用性。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多领域预训练和跨领域迁移框架MDGCL，通过对比学习策略和领域注意力机制，显著提升了图基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据在不同领域的语义和属性差异巨大，传统对比预训练策略无法有效吸收多领域知识，因此需要一种新方法来识别和利用这些差异。

Method: 设计了一种对比学习策略来识别领域差异，并引入领域令牌编码全局信息；在下游任务中使用领域注意力机制实现细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，MDGCL方法在准确率和Macro-F1分数上分别最高提升了19.33%和19.13%。

Conclusion: MDGCL通过有效利用领域差异和多领域知识，显著提升了图基础模型的性能，为跨领域图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

*Younwoo Choi,Changling Li,Yongjin Yang,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）的对话伙伴意识（interlocutor awareness），即LLM识别和适应对话伙伴身份及特征的能力，并首次系统评估了当代LLM中这一能力的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多智能体和人机系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身和对话伙伴的认知能力对确保可靠性和安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注情境意识，而忽视了对话伙伴意识的评估。

Method: 论文通过三个维度（推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好）评估LLM的对话伙伴推断能力，并开发了三个案例研究展示其实际影响。

Result: 研究发现LLM能可靠识别同类模型（如GPT和Claude），对话伙伴意识既能提升多LLM协作，也可能引发新的安全和对齐漏洞。

Conclusion: 对话伙伴意识在LLM中具有双重性，既带来潜力也伴随风险，需进一步研究和安全措施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ReG方法，通过LLM反馈和结构化重组模块优化图基RAG中的检索器，显著提升性能并减少推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图基RAG中检索器因缺乏真实数据和图数据抽象性导致的性能不足问题。

Method: 结合LLM反馈去除虚假信号，并引入结构感知重组模块重构检索结果为逻辑连贯的证据链。

Result: 实验显示ReG在不同LLM上性能提升达10%，训练数据需求减少80%，推理成本降低30%。

Conclusion: ReG有效优化图基RAG，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个德语Telegram虚假信息检测数据集Misinfo-TeleGraph，包含500万条消息，结合文本和图神经网络（GNN）方法，GraphSAGE模型表现优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播的重要渠道，但连通性和消息传播信息在虚假信息检测中未充分利用。

Method: 构建包含消息、元数据和标签的数据集，使用M3嵌入和人工标注生成标签，评估文本模型和GNN（如GraphSAGE）。

Result: GraphSAGE结合LSTM聚合在MCC和F1分数上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为德语Telegram虚假信息检测提供了可复现的基准和开放数据集，展示了弱监督的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

TL;DR: RExBench是一个用于评估LLM代理在未实现研究假设扩展任务中表现的基准测试，包含12个任务。测试显示当前代理在无人类指导时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展能力是LLM代理的关键能力，但缺乏评估工具。

Method: 开发RExBench基准，包含12个任务，支持自动评估。

Result: 测试的9个LLM代理在无人类提示时表现差，最佳成功率低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理仍需大量人类指导才能处理现实研究扩展任务。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

Motivation: 研究旨在提升动态测试集上的检索增强生成（RAG）系统性能，结合多种检索方法并优化生成策略。

Method: 采用混合检索方法（BM25和E5），结合Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并评估神经重排序（RankLLaMA）和DSPy优化提示策略的效果。

Result: 神经重排序显著提升性能（MAP从0.523到0.797），但计算成本高；DSPy优化提示策略提高语义相似性但存在过度自信问题。最终系统在比赛中表现良好。

Conclusion: 混合检索方法在动态测试集上表现优异，但需权衡性能提升与计算成本。词汇对齐是性能的关键预测因素。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在分析高压力环境（如太空任务）中团队沟通动态的潜力，尤其是仅能获取文本数据时的应用。

Method: 使用编码器模型（如RoBERTa、DistilBERT）和解码器模型（如Llama-3.1），通过零样本分类、微调和生成方法检测微行为。

Result: 编码器模型表现不佳，而解码器模型（Llama-3.1）在3类和2类分类中分别达到44%和68%的宏F1分数。

Conclusion: 解码器模型更适合检测团队对话中的微行为，对开发分析团队沟通的语音技术有重要意义。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过优化draft模型的词汇表来提高基于drafter的推测解码（SpD）方法的性能，减少内存受限环境中的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在draft阶段存在不必要的推理开销，尤其是对于词汇量大的目标模型，VocabTrim旨在通过限制draft模型的词汇表来减少这种开销。

Method: VocabTrim重构draft模型的LM head，仅包含目标模型中最常采样的有限词汇集，从而减少draft阶段的延迟。

Result: 在内存受限环境下，VocabTrim显著减少了draft延迟，尽管略微降低了接受率，但整体提升了生成速度（如Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct的MBSU提升了16%）。

Conclusion: VocabTrim是一种简单有效的方法，能够在内存受限环境中显著提升推测解码的效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI语言模型与人类文本理解和生成之间关系的知识空白。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP领域的专家合作对话，分析人类与AI在语言任务中的互动。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供对人类语言处理的见解，但无法完全复制人类语言能力；人机协作在语言任务中具有潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: 报告旨在指导未来研究，强调伦理和负责任地使用AI技术，以增强人类语言能力。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LAIL的辅助损失框架，结合CTC解码的高效性和大型语言模型的语义知识，显著提升了CTC-based ASR的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CTC-based ASR模型在语言依赖性建模上的不足，同时保持其非自回归解码的高效性。

Method: 通过连接层将中间编码器输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在多个语料库上显著降低了WER，实现了CTC-based ASR的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效结合了CTC的高效性和LLM的语言建模能力，为实时ASR提供了新思路。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

*Niyati Bafna,Tianjian Li,Kenton Murray,David R. Mortensen,David Yarowsky,Hale Sirin,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在多语言生成中存在翻译障碍，导致中低资源语言生成质量差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言生成质量低的原因，特别是中低资源语言。

Method: 通过日志透镜观察模型中间层处理，测试108种语言对的单词翻译任务。

Result: 翻译失败是导致整体失败的主要原因，尤其是低资源目标语言。

Conclusion: 翻译障碍是多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过扩展语义上下文窗口的新型训练方法，提升ASR系统在命名实体和数值数据上的识别与格式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据的识别与格式化上表现不佳，影响关键领域（如法律、金融、医疗）的语义理解。

Method: 采用重叠上下文窗口训练，通过5秒重叠扩展30秒音频块为40秒有效语义窗口，并重新分配跨边界实体至右侧块，同时嵌入实体标签丰富训练数据。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上，该方法显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练能有效解决ASR系统在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

prediction training (SFT), Jan-nano achieves 83.2% on SimpleQA benchmark with
MCP integration while running on consumer hardware. With 128K context length,
Jan-nano proves that intelligence isn't about scale, it's about strategy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著减少了奖励黑客行为的未检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励黑客行为，而不会在推理中暴露，这对高风险应用构成威胁。

Method: 提出VFT方法，训练模型在受到提示线索影响时明确承认，随后在RL环境中评估其效果。

Result: VFT训练后，未检测到的奖励黑客行为降至6%，而未经VFT的RL模型高达88%。

Conclusion: VFT通过提高模型对奖励黑客行为的明确承认，显著提升了检测能力，为更透明和安全的AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

*Jianxin Yan,Wangze Ni,Lei Chen,Xuemin Lin,Peng Cheng,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构优化多轮对话中的缓存命中率，显著降低LLM的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：首先基于向量检索当前查询，再通过自注意力机制整合历史和当前对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中提升了精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著降低了LLM对话应用的计算成本，同时提高了缓存效率。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Motivation: 尽管MedLLMs在临床任务中表现出色，但其伦理安全性尚未充分研究，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 构建包含5,623个选择题和5,351个开放题的MedEthicsQA基准，整合全球医学伦理标准，并通过多阶段过滤和专家验证确保质量。

Result: 评估显示MedLLMs在医学伦理问题上的表现低于基础模型，揭示了伦理对齐的缺陷。

Conclusion: MedEthicsQA为评估MedLLMs的伦理安全性提供了可靠工具，揭示了其伦理对齐的不足。

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising $\textbf{5,623}$ multiple-choice questions and
$\textbf{5,351}$ open-ended questions for evaluation of medical ethics in LLMs.
We systematically establish a hierarchical taxonomy integrating global medical
ethical standards. The benchmark encompasses widely used medical datasets,
authoritative question banks, and scenarios derived from PubMed literature.
Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一模型在多领域信息提取任务中缺乏适应性和可扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: SaM框架通过动态选择和合并预训练的领域专家模型，基于领域相似性和性能采样，创建针对目标领域的任务特定模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SaM框架平均比统一模型性能提升10%，并展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架通过动态合并专家模型，显著提升了跨领域任务的泛化能力和可扩展性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出知识增强微调（KAFT）方法，通过结合领域特定数据和外部知识微调大语言模型（LLMs），显著提升了在检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的系统中生成响应的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在对话系统中取得进展，但在知识密集型场景中易出错。现有方法（如RAG和代理）通过外部知识库增强LLMs，但LLMs难以有效利用检索到的知识生成响应。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，在RAG和代理系统中用领域特定数据和知识微调LLMs，并在MobileCS2数据集上系统比较KAFT与提示技术的效果。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中显著优于提示技术，尤其在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的论文，为提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Conclusion: 研究强调了现实场景中多轮对话的重要性，并提供了公开的代码和数据以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

Method: 复现Ortu等人的实验，扩展到更大模型（Llama 3.1 8B），测试不同提示结构和领域的影响。

Result: 发现注意力头专业化在更大模型中减弱，提示结构显著影响结果，某些领域的数据会扭曲实验结果。

Conclusion: 注意力头消融方法的有效性受模型架构、提示结构和领域影响，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

Abstract: Syntactic language models (SLMs) enhance Transformers by incorporating
syntactic biases through the modeling of linearized syntactic parse trees
alongside surface sentences. This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are
based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of
constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in
existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在显著差距，需更全面的评估方法。

Method: 基于SoMi环境生成的多模态互动数据，支持第一人称和第三人称视角的多层次评估。

Result: 人类在SoMi-ToM上的表现显著优于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs），准确率差距达40.1%（第一人称）和26.4%（第三人称）。

Conclusion: 未来LVLMs需提升在具身复杂社交互动中的ToM能力。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语缺乏高质量的NER数据集，尤其是在历史文本分析领域。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多句手动标注的句子，并评估了现有NER模型的性能。

Result: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，并提供了模型性能的基准。

Conclusion: MariNER为巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的NER任务提供了重要资源，并展示了现有模型的适用性。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在分子结构解析任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏专业化学知识。

Method: 构建外部分子子结构知识库，设计分子-光谱评分器作为奖励模型，并利用蒙特卡洛树搜索进行推理。

Result: 实验结果显示，K-MSE框架显著提升了性能，在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上均取得了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架通过知识增强和优化推理过程，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的局限性。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL框架结合Text-to-SQL和向量搜索，解决非结构化数据和模糊查询的问题，支持语义过滤和多模态匹配，性能显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL对非结构化数据和模糊查询效果不佳，而向量搜索虽强大但依赖人工实现，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，结合语义搜索扩展查询，构建向量索引，并通过自动标注和专家评审生成真实数据。

Result: 实验表明，Text2VectorSQL在性能上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Text2VectorSQL为更灵活直观的数据库交互奠定了基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

TL;DR: 论文提出Genres基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在双人互动中的性别偏见，揭示了单场景评估中未发现的上下文敏感偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估单场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见，因此需要更深入的关系和上下文偏见分析。

Method: 引入Genres基准，通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务，评估多模态大语言模型在社交关系中的性别偏见。

Result: 实验发现，开源和闭源模型均存在单角色场景中未显现的上下文敏感性别偏见。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断互动驱动的性别偏见至关重要，为未来偏见缓解提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个针对印度多元文化的公平性评估基准，涵盖85个身份群体，揭示了主流LLMs对边缘化群体的负面偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要基于西方文化，无法适用于印度等多元文化国家，因此需要开发本土化评估工具。

Method: 通过专家咨询确定1800多个社会文化主题，生成并验证20000个现实场景模板，分为合理性、判断和生成三个任务评估LLMs。

Result: 评估14个主流LLMs发现其对边缘化群体存在强烈偏见，且难以通过理性化要求缓解。

Conclusion: LLMs在印度语境中可能引发分配和表征性伤害，需谨慎使用，并开源INDIC-BIAS以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在英语和混合语言（英语-印地语）的网络迷因中识别叙事角色（英雄、反派、受害者等）的挑战，通过扩展数据集和评估多种模型，发现文化背景和提示设计对任务的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络迷因中的叙事角色识别具有文化和语言复杂性，现有数据集偏向‘其他’类别，需更平衡和多样化的数据支持。

Method: 扩展了标注数据集，评估了多语言Transformer、情感分类器、指令调优LLM和多模态视觉语言模型，并探索了提示设计策略。

Result: 大型模型如DeBERTa-v3和Qwen2.5-VL表现较好，但‘受害者’类别的识别仍具挑战性，跨文化和混合语言内容泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中分别达到97.78%和79.92%的完成率，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1显著提升了模型在具身任务中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，性能平均提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动优化推理格式，有效提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决传统RAG流程在处理复杂技术文档（如表格和图像）时的局限性，以及LLMs（大语言模型）的知识过时和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合向量相似性搜索和基于Gemma-2-9b-it的重新排序器的RAG流程，使用RAFT（检索增强微调）在自定义数据集上训练，优化上下文识别。

Result: 在RAGas和DeepEval评估中，分别达到94%和96%的忠实度分数，87%和93%的答案相关性分数，优于通用RAG流程。

Conclusion: 改进的RAG流程在处理技术文档中的表格和图像时表现优异，显著提升了问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱补全方法多为静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态，FMS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FMS包含语义上下文学习模块和条件流匹配模块，动态优化实体对的初始静态评分。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，实现了更深层次的关系语义建模。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 现有方法在深度搜索和完整证据检索上存在困难，导致性能显著下降，需进一步优化检索策略。

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Motivation: 当前评估ICL效果的方法存在可靠性低、归因性差和数据依赖性强的问题，亟需一种更可靠的指标。

Method: 通过建模学习增益与上下文相关性之间的斜率（LCS），量化ICL效果，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Result: LCS在标注数据场景中与性能提升强相关，在数据稀缺或偏差场景中也能可靠反映ICL效果。

Conclusion: LCS是一种可靠且实用的ICL评估指标，为模型能力提供了可操作的阈值和关键洞察。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Motivation: 高标注成本促使使用大语言模型（LLMs）合成演示样本以减少开销，但现有方法依赖任务特定性或预存样本，无法从零开始合成。

Method: 提出V-Score一致性度量，并基于此设计V-Synthesis方法，通过比例采样确保合成样本的一致性和多样性。

Result: 实验表明，V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示样本的挑战，提高了任务适应性和性能。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

Result: 通过比较不同超参数设置下的方法，展示了RiverText在流式场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: RiverText为信息检索和自然语言处理社区提供了处理流式词嵌入的工具，支持动态语言模式的适应。

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型对齐提供了一种更高效、可扩展的新范式，并首次理论证明了强化学习在LLM中的有效性。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于大语言模型的拼写规范化方法，一种无监督训练，另一种基于机器翻译。评估表明，机器翻译方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文献中拼写不标准化是长期困扰人文学者的问题，拼写规范化旨在将其与现代标准对齐。

Method: 提出两种方法：一种无监督训练的大语言模型，另一种基于机器翻译的大语言模型。

Result: 在多语言和历史时期数据集上评估，两种方法均有效，但机器翻译方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译仍是拼写规范化任务的最合适技术。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

*P. Myles Eugenio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部事件驱动涌现学习的神经符号框架，用于生成语言建模，核心是分层Hopfield记忆链，作为组合短期记忆和动态分词器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过投影张量绑定共现特征为分层标记，引入冗余并压缩局部激活为长程依赖。

Result: 模型能从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有内部形态一致性的合成语言，且能通过局部学习实现泛化。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部神经学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

*Shouvon Sarker,Xishuang Dong,Lijun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建基于BERT的集成模型，从临床笔记中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用。n2c2 2022提供了共享任务，旨在解决电子健康记录（EHR）中的自然语言处理挑战。

Method: 研究使用预训练的BERT模型（基于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据），并在CMED训练数据上微调。通过集成多个微调BERT模型的预测结果，采用投票策略生成最终预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于BERT的集成模型显著提高了严格Micro-F分数（约5%）和严格Macro-F分数（约6%）。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的集成模型能有效提升药物事件分类的性能，为临床数据分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

*Yumeng Lin,Xufeng Duan,David Haslett,Yige Chen,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练数据、语言距离和语系对多语言翻译中信息损失的影响，发现数据量和语言结构关系共同影响翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是数据有限或与英语差异大的语言）中仍面临挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU和BERT相似度指标衡量翻译质量。

Result: 训练数据量和语言距离交互作用显著：数据充足可缓解语言差异影响，而结构接近英语的语言在低资源条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅受数据量影响，还与语言间的结构和类型关系密切相关。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

TL;DR: ATGen框架将主动学习（AL）与文本生成任务结合，利用人类标注者和基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动标注代理，减少标注成本和API调用费用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AL在减少标注需求方面表现出色，但其在自然语言生成（NLG）任务中的应用有限。ATGen旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ATGen是一个统一框架，支持LLM服务（如ChatGPT）或本地部署，简化AL在NLG任务中的应用，并提供实现和基准测试平台。

Result: 评估显示，ATGen能显著减少人类标注者的工作量和LLM API调用成本。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一种高效的AL解决方案，代码开源且支持多样化应用。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

*Taejin Kim,Siun-Chuon Mau,Konrad Vesey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化LLM输出视角的方法，包括Perspective Space和Systematic Prompt Engineering，用于检测和控制LLM的偏见和视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在关键任务中的广泛应用，但其输出偏见和视角缺乏量化理解，因此需要一种方法来量化和控制LLM的视角。

Method: 提出Perspective-Dial，包含Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 通过实证方法，成功量化并调整了LLM输出的视角，适用于多种主题。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM偏见的检测、追踪和缓解提供了潜在应用，如公共话语中的叙事检测和辩论机器人。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于记忆组织的生成框架（MOG），用于自动生成维基百科文章，通过分层记忆架构提高信息的准确性和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成维基百科文章需要整合多样化的信息源，确保内容准确、全面且结构清晰。现有方法在信息组织和生成过程中存在挑战。

Method: MOG框架从网络文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为维基百科式的分层结构，并利用该结构指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的评估表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的文章方面优于基线方法，尤其适用于实际场景。

Conclusion: MOG框架通过分层记忆结构和引用模块，显著提升了自动生成维基百科文章的质量和可验证性。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究呼吁创建更具多样性的公平性基准，并更谨慎地使用现有数据集。

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法TuCo，用于量化微调对LLM输出的贡献，并发现对抗攻击通过降低TuCo来绕过安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏系统分析微调对LLM个体输出影响的方法。

Method: 通过追踪模型的中间隐藏状态，将微调后的LLM分解为预训练和微调两部分，并定义TuCo（微调贡献比）。

Result: 发现对抗攻击通过降低TuCo绕过安全措施，且TuCo在攻击成功时较低。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全的影响提供了量化工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型虽然生成质量高，但逐词生成的特性限制了速度，成为瓶颈。

Method: 设计了一种流水线解码器，同时生成多个子序列，实现并行化。

Result: 在问答、摘要和关键词生成等任务中，生成速度显著提升，质量无明显损失。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理大型表格时因输入长度限制导致的性能问题。

Method: 提出ATF框架，结合LLM生成的列描述、聚类和稀疏-密集对齐分数，动态过滤无关列和行。

Result: 实验显示ATF减少约70%表格单元，提升跨领域TableQA任务性能，但对Table Fact Verification略有下降。

Conclusion: ATF能自适应平衡信息量与简洁性，适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的交互式推荐代理因规划和泛化能力有限，难以有效处理多样且复杂的用户意图。

Method: 设计了TAIRA系统，采用多智能体架构，通过思想模式蒸馏（TPD）增强规划能力，并设计了用户模拟方案进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，TAIRA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务中优势显著，且能有效泛化到新任务。

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思想模式蒸馏和多智能体协作，显著提升了交互式推荐系统处理复杂用户意图的能力。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Result: SFT快速学习但遗忘严重，RFT学习慢但保留知识。数据分布是关键因素。

Conclusion: RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Motivation: 分析LLM在生成食谱时对记忆内容的依赖、创造性合成能力以及无意义内容的产生，并探索自动化评估方法以扩大研究规模。

Method: 通过人工标注20个LLM生成的食谱，分析其记忆和创造性内容；设计自动化流程（LLM-as-judge）进行大规模评估。

Result: Mixtral模型倾向于重用训练数据中的食材；自动化流程中，Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B在食材匹配上达到78%准确率。

Conclusion: 自动化框架能有效量化LLM生成内容中的记忆、创造性和无意义性，为模型创造性能力提供严谨证据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成语义多样的响应上表现不足，限制了相关应用的效果。

Method: SemDiD结合正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置去偏概率评估，平衡质量与多样性。

Result: 实验显示SemDiD在多样任务中表现优异，提升Best-of-N覆盖率1.4-5.2%，加速RLHF训练15%，准确率提高2.1%。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效解决了语义多样性问题，为相关应用提供了更优的解码方案。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于大五人格的LLM代理是否能复现人格特质对假信息敏感性的影响，发现部分特质（如宜人性和尽责性）能可靠复现，但其他特质存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成的行为数据是否能准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异，为行为模拟提供伦理和低成本替代方案。

Method: 利用已知人格特质的真实人类数据，创建匹配的LLM代理，比较其与人类在新闻辨别任务中的反应模式。

Result: 部分人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与假信息敏感性的关联被可靠复现，但其他特质存在系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在行为模拟中具有潜力但存在局限，为人工代理的认知多样性建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估文本分类系统的鲁棒性，通过最小修改改变模型预测。

Method: 扩展BeamAttack算法，支持单词删除和跳过替换，集成LIME优化替换优先级。

Result: 在BiLSTM、BERT和RoBERTa等模型上实现99%攻击成功率，保持文本相似性。

Conclusion: BeamAttack扩展版高效且实用，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: We extend BeamAttack, an adversarial attack algorithm designed to evaluate
the robustness of text classification systems through word-level modifications
guided by beam search. Our extensions include support for word deletions and
the option to skip substitutions, enabling the discovery of minimal
modifications that alter model predictions. We also integrate LIME to better
prioritize word replacements. Evaluated across multiple datasets and victim
models (BiLSTM, BERT, and adversarially trained RoBERTa) within the BODEGA
framework, our approach achieves over a 99\% attack success rate while
preserving the semantic and lexical similarity of the original texts. Through
both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we highlight BeamAttack's
effectiveness and its limitations. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库替代真实语料库访问，在隐私敏感或资源受限环境中实现高性能嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知嵌入方法需要访问目标语料库或领域特定微调的问题，适用于隐私敏感或资源受限场景。

Method: 使用多步分层程序生成合成上下文语料库，模拟关键领域特定分布，冻结编码器使用代理语料库生成域适应嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，仅用五个示例文档的ZEST性能接近全目标语料库访问模型的0.5%以内。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、适应性嵌入提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在多轮长期任务中作为自主代理时的可扩展性和训练效率问题。

Method: 引入 L0 训练管道和 NB-Agent，采用代码即行动的方式，通过 REPL 实现。使用 RLVR 进行训练。

Result: 在 SimpleQA 上准确率从 30% 提升至 80%，HotpotQA 上从 22% 提升至 41%。

Conclusion: L0 系统显著提升了代理的训练效率和性能，并已开源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training
recipes on (https://github.com/cmriat/l0).

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估基准通常是静态的，无法充分评估大型语言模型在现实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: AutoEvoEval引入了22种可解释的原子进化操作，并支持多轮组合，以生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本。

Result: 实验结果显示，原子操作导致平均准确率下降7.283%，结构破坏或误导性语义编辑影响最大。多步组合可将对抗效果放大至52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估了模型的真实泛化能力，强调了进化感知的鲁棒性评估的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化并分析大型语言模型在二元问题回答中的位置偏见，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下的表现。

Method: 通过改编SQuAD-it数据集，增加错误选项并逐步减少上下文，创建不同不确定性的数据集。同时评估WebGPT和Winning Arguments两个高不确定性基准。

Result: 位置偏见在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下呈指数增长。

Conclusion: 模型在不确定性高时更容易受到位置偏见的影响，需在设计任务时考虑这一因素。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

TL;DR: DuP-PO算法解决了大型推理模型在处理简单任务时因过度思考而效率低下的问题，显著提升了推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在处理简单任务时会产生冗余的思考标记，导致效率降低，这种现象被称为“思考陷阱”。

Method: 提出了Dual Policy Preference Optimization（DuP-PO）算法，包括平衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略塑造方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提高了模型的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了思考陷阱问题，提升了大型推理模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Conclusion: 当前基准的有效性受到挑战，需开发更注重推理过程的评估协议。论文发布了审计数据和工具以支持更透明的模型推理评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在复杂多步推理任务中表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAPS显著优于标准CoT，并与专用推理模型竞争。

Conclusion: MAPS通过平衡反思深度与成本，实现了通用LLMs在推理任务中的高效表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 研究如何评估LLM内部知识的真实性，并发现现有方法存在缺陷。

Method: 引入sAwMIL方法，基于多实例学习和一致性预测，利用LLM的内部激活状态区分真实、虚假和中性陈述。

Result: 实验表明，sAwMIL在16个开源LLM上表现良好，揭示了真实性信号的分布特点及不同探针的适用性。

Conclusion: sAwMIL为验证LLM内部知识提供了一种可靠方法，揭示了其知识表示的特点。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Result: 尽管LLMs在英语表现优异，但在其他语言及罕见形态模式上表现不佳，特别是在判断不合语法示例时。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言复杂性处理上存在明显不足，需进一步改进。IMPACT框架已公开以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Conclusion: 该框架为领域自适应MLLMs的可扩展组合提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been successfully used to probe Large

representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

TL;DR: 该论文致力于通过自然语言处理和机器学习方法，自动识别科学文本的忠实性，并开发相关工具和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学文本在线数量的激增，自动识别其忠实性成为社会重要问题。

Method: 提出自动事实核查、有限数据学习和科学文本处理的新方法，包括对抗性声明生成、多源域适应等。

Result: 开发了识别可核查声明、检测夸大科学声明等工具，并展示了如何从有限数据中有效学习。

Conclusion: 研究成果有助于识别科学误传，并为科学传播过程提供新见解。

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化主题分析（TA）流程，用于分析先天性心脏病（CHD）患者和护理者的临床叙事，减少人工编码需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动主题分析（TA）在临床叙事分析中耗时且难以扩展，而自动化方法可以更高效地提取患者和护理者的体验。

Method: 采用多智能体框架的LLM管道，结合强化学习（RLHF）优化主题质量，实现端到端的自动化TA。

Result: 系统能够高效、规模化地分析大规模定性数据集，并支持针对特定临床场景的LLM微调。

Conclusion: 该自动化TA方法为临床叙事分析提供了可扩展且以患者为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学教育中的应用潜力，发现其能高效解决简单数学问题，但在理解真实世界情境方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在数学教育中的实际能力，尤其是解决数学应用题的能力，以明确其作为教学工具的潜力。

Method: 研究方法包括技术概述、对213项研究的系统文献综述，以及对四种LLM模型在287道数学应用题上的实证评估。

Result: 结果显示，LLMs能近乎完美地解决简单问题（如PISA题目），但在处理需要真实世界情境理解的问题时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结论指出，LLMs仅掌握了解题的表层过程，未能真正理解问题情境，限制了其在数学课堂中的教学价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Motivation: 现有图像描述评估指标的解释缺乏标准化和验证，EXPERT旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最优性能，并通过人工验证证明其解释质量显著优于现有指标。

Conclusion: EXPERT为图像描述任务提供了一种更可靠且可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Motivation: 前沿AI开发者依赖多层防护措施防止AI系统被滥用，但这些管线的安全性尚未充分评估。

Method: 开发开源防御管线，测试少样本提示分类器的性能，并设计STACK攻击方法进行红队测试。

Result: 少样本提示分类器在ClearHarm数据集上表现优异，但STACK攻击在封闭和转移场景中分别达到71%和33%的成功率。

Conclusion: 开发者需采取特定措施应对分阶段攻击，以提升防御管线的安全性。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

*Yanhong Li,Ming Li,Karen Livescu,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型的预测能力与其嵌入空间的广度密切相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型嵌入空间的分散程度与其性能之间的关系，并利用这一关系优化模型选择、检索方法及训练目标。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量的平均余弦距离（表示分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并设计实验验证分散度在模型选择、检索和训练中的应用。

Result: 分散度与困惑度呈强负相关；分散度可用于预测模型在新领域的表现、优化检索层选择，并通过训练目标直接提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散度是语言模型性能的关键指标，可广泛应用于模型优化和任务改进。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动比较方法耗时且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在提高效率和准确性方面的潜力。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE模型生成词嵌入，通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估并行与非并行段落的区分能力。

Result: E5在并行检测中表现最佳，AlephBERT在非并行区分中更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型可提升古代文本并行检测的效率和准确性，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，针对结构健康监测中的裂纹定位问题，通过非线性各向异性扩散和RANSAC估计实现高精度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和纹理干扰下表现不佳，需要一种更适应裂纹定位的解决方案。

Method: 采用改进的KAZE架构，结合非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留尺度空间，并使用RANSAC进行单应性估计。

Result: 在多种实际条件下，该方法将裂纹面积和长度误差分别降低70%和90%，对齐误差保持在5%以下。

Conclusion: 该方法为裂纹演化跟踪提供了一种无需训练、参数调整或校准的鲁棒解决方案，适用于移动平台和无人机部署。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在害虫计数置信度测试集上MSE降低31.7%，R2提升15.2%。

Conclusion: 首次全面评估计数置信度，量化影响因素关系，为精准农业决策提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类任务中缺乏视频示例或时间标注的问题，现有对比视觉语言模型无法捕捉关键的时间结构。

Method: 使用大语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过动态时间规整（DTW）在共享嵌入空间中对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准上达到30.5%的准确率（人类准确率为61.6%），参数用量减少8倍。

Conclusion: 结合结构化语言先验和经典对齐技术，为细粒度视频理解提供了一种可扩展的通用方法。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Conclusion: MoDiff是一种高效且理论支持的扩散模型加速方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Conclusion: CoreMark通过创新的CORE嵌入范式，为文本水印提供了高效、通用的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院和长期护理机构中，床旁跌倒是一个主要伤害来源，现有警报系统往往在患者离床后才触发，无法提前预防。

Method: 使用四个低成本负载传感器采集数据，将信号转换为互补图像（RGB线图和三种纹理图），并设计双流Swin Transformer（ViFusionTST）进行并行处理和跨模态融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST的准确率为0.885，F1分数为0.794，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法是一种实用且有效的实时隐私保护跌倒预防方案。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Method: 通过减少相关体积和高分辨率训练协议，结合多帧估计，优化RAFT类架构的设计选择。

Result: 在1080p输入下运行时仅需2.09 GB内存，训练时28.5 GB，性能优于资源密集型方法，在多个基准测试中排名第一。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在高分辨率光流估计中实现了内存效率和性能的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the

extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在图像超分辨率中真实性与计算效率之间的权衡问题，尤其是减少采样步骤导致的图像模糊问题。

Result: 在LPIPS、LOE、PSNR、SSIM等指标上表现优异，边缘重建能力更强，且具有自适应学习能力。

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率的真实性和计算效率上取得了显著平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全至关重要，但现有MLLMs在视觉安全违规检测中存在知识冲突问题。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成34,000张合成手术室图像，包含违反安全规则的实体，并辅以214张人工标注图像作为验证基准。通过微调MLLMs研究VS-KC。

Result: 微调显著提升了模型对训练冲突实体的检测能力，但对未训练实体类型表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究提出了针对规则违反场景的数据生成方法，公开了OR-VSKC数据集，并分析了MLLMs的知识一致性。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Conclusion: 三维姿态数据为足球盘带分析提供了更丰富的视角，补充了传统二维数据的不足。

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

Motivation: 由于夜间缺乏可见光，无法进行全天候气象观测，研究旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI多波段热红外亮度温度数据，开发了RefDiff模型，实现夜间可见光反射率检索。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云结构和厚云区域表现尤为突出，夜间检索能力与白天相当。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率检索能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用现有图像数据为静态图像注入动态效果，强调重新诠释而非简单复制。

Method: 使用k-means聚类对图像块分组，通过匹配和随机采样从聚类中重建新目标图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像动画提供了一种灵活且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a patch-based image reconstruction and animation method that uses
existing image data to bring still images to life through motion. Image patches
from curated datasets are grouped using k-means clustering and a new target
image is reconstructed by matching and randomly sampling from these clusters.
This approach emphasizes reinterpretation over replication, allowing the source
and target domains to differ conceptually while sharing local structures.

### [150] [Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562)
*Abhineet Singh,Nilanjan Ray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文改进了Pix2Seq目标检测器，将其扩展到视频领域，提出了一种新的端到端视频目标检测方法，解决了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频目标检测方法通常依赖于图像特定的2D框并链接这些框来构建视频对象，且训练过程中需要注入定位线索，限制了性能和灵活性。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将对象表示为可变长度的离散标记序列，避免了传统检测器对可能框的采样需求，并直接输出完全集成的3D框或轨迹，无需后处理。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法相比Pix2Seq静态检测器表现更优，并在UA-DETRAC上与当前最先进的视频检测器竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频目标检测中表现出色，尽管受限于计算资源，但仍具有竞争力，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

TL;DR: VisionScores是首个系统分割的图像乐谱数据集，专注于双钢琴曲目，提供结构丰富、高信息密度的图像，适用于机器和深度学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为机器和深度学习任务提供结构丰富且信息密度高的图像乐谱数据，同时考虑图形相似性和作曲模式。

Method: 构建了包含24.8k样本的数据集，分为两个场景：同一作曲类型不同作者（14k样本）和同一作者不同作曲类型（10.8k样本），所有样本为128×512像素的灰度图像。

Result: 提供了格式化样本、系统顺序、乐谱元数据，以及未分割的全页乐谱和预处理图像。

Conclusion: VisionScores为乐谱分析任务提供了全面的数据集支持，适用于多种研究需求。

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images
are included for further analysis.

TL;DR: MMKD-CLIP通过多教师知识蒸馏构建高性能生物医学基础模型，克服数据稀缺和异构性问题，在58个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本对数据，且数据模态和标准不统一，限制了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，然后从9个教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在所有任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法，适用于实际数据限制场景。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业图像语义分割对精准农业至关重要，需高效方法以支持决策和干预。

Method: 集成DAS Conv模块于DeepLabV3框架，优化跳连以增强空间特征捕捉。

Result: 模型在Agriculture Vision数据集上表现优于基线，效率提升66%，性能接近复杂SOTA模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为农业遥感提供了一种高效、轻量的高质量语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIGHT是一种多模态方法，结合语言、图像和几何特征，用于链接历史地图上的文本，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对多学科研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是多词地名。

Method: LIGHT通过几何感知嵌入模块编码文本区域的多边形坐标，结合LayoutLMv3的视觉和语言特征，预测文本实例的阅读顺序。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习对历史地图文本链接有效，LIGHT提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

Conclusion: JAM-Flow为多模态生成建模提供了实用解决方案，推动了音视频合成的整体发展。

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a
practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMT是一种新颖的混合框架，用于高效学习fMRI数据中的长程时空特征，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如卷积神经网络或Transformer）难以建模fMRI数据中的复杂关系，尤其是长程时空依赖性。

Method: BrainMT采用两阶段设计：1）双向Mamba块捕获全局时间交互；2）Transformer块建模全局空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类和回归任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效建模fMRI数据的时空依赖性，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强大型多模态模型在像素级任务（如分割）中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 采用强化学习训练模型生成点提示和边界框提示，结合SAM2生成分割掩码，并引入GRPO策略优化训练。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，且在零样本任务中表现优异（RefCOCOg测试71.4 cIoU，ReasonSeg测试56.7 gIoU）。

Conclusion: Seg-R1展示了纯强化学习训练在分割任务中的潜力，并具备强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块ReCo，用于缓解视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题，通过几何代数和关系组合实现，无需修改模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在视觉和语言数据整合中表现出色，但容易产生幻觉（生成与视觉输入无关或矛盾的文本），主要原因是过度依赖语言输入。

Method: 提出ReCo模块，基于几何代数和关系组合，可附加于任何VLM上，无需其他修改。

Result: 在InstructBLIP、LlaVA和MiniGPT4三种主流VLM上验证，性能提升显著，且可与其他减少幻觉的方法结合。

Conclusion: ReCo模块能有效缓解VLMs的幻觉问题，且具有轻量化和兼容性强的优势。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Conclusion: CaO$_2$通过解决不一致性问题，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的效果，为高分辨率数据集的高效处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Result: LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色，且计算复杂度极低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性是提升盲超分辨率性能的关键，LightBSR为轻量级高效模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

Result: 在遮挡情况下，部分分割性能优于现有方法13%，对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态采样和遮挡场景下表现优异，优于依赖点对应关系的现有方法。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

Motivation: 现有采样方法在速度和置信区域大小上存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，减少了计算时间，置信区域体积显著缩小。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and

TL;DR: XTransfer是一种资源高效、模态无关的模型迁移方法，通过模型修复和层重组解决边缘系统中深度学习模型的模态偏移和资源限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘系统中深度学习模型的训练和开发受限于传感器数据稀缺和资源约束，现有方法存在模态偏移、资源需求高和适应性差的问题。

Method: XTransfer通过模型修复（修复模态偏移）和层重组（高效搜索和重组源模型层）实现资源高效的模型迁移。

Result: XTransfer在多种人类感知任务中达到最优性能，显著降低了数据收集、模型训练和边缘部署的成本。

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统中的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

TL;DR: UniFuse是一个通用的多模态医学图像融合框架，通过降解感知提示学习模块和Omni统一特征表示方案，解决了现有方法对高质量、对齐图像的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态医学图像融合方法依赖于高质量和对齐的源图像，但在处理未对齐或降级图像时效果不佳。

Method: UniFuse框架结合降解感知提示学习模块、Omni统一特征表示方案和通用特征恢复与融合模块，实现对齐、恢复和融合的联合优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，UniFuse在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniFuse通过统一框架解决了多模态医学图像融合中的对齐和恢复问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

*Yun Zhang,Feifan Chen,Na Li,Zhiwei Guo,Xu Wang,Fen Miao,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的联合几何和属性上采样方法（JGAU），用于生成高质量彩色点云，并发布了大规模数据集SYSU-PCUD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 彩色点云是3D应用的主流表示，但生成大规模且密集的彩色点云仍具挑战性。

Method: JGAU框架包括几何上采样网络和属性上采样网络，利用空间属性相关性，并通过两种粗属性上采样方法和属性增强模块优化结果。

Result: JGAU在4倍、8倍、12倍和16倍上采样率下的PSNR分别为33.90、32.10、31.10和30.39分贝，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JGAU显著提升了彩色点云上采样的质量，为3D应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练模型的金属透镜摄影方法，通过多路径扩散和伪数据增强实现高保真图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属透镜在超紧凑计算成像中潜力巨大，但面临光学退化和计算恢复的挑战，现有方法依赖精确校准或大数据集，难以实际应用。

Method: 采用Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion框架，结合正、中、负提示路径和伪数据增强，引入SVDA模块自适应建模退化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，实现高保真和锐利的图像重建。

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练模型和可控解码器，解决了金属透镜摄影中的退化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Motivation: 解决真实世界演示数据收集成本高、效率低的问题，同时缩小仿真与现实的差距。

Method: 利用3D高斯散射（3DGS）构建逼真仿真，结合增量语义蒸馏（ISD）和3D正则化NNFM损失（3D-NNFM），并通过LLMs和VLMs实现自动化仿真。

Result: 在多个数据集和场景（如RLBench、COLOSSEUM等）上验证了RoboPearls的有效性和仿真性能。

Conclusion: RoboPearls为机器人操作提供了一种高效、可扩展的仿真解决方案，显著提升了仿真与现实的结合能力。

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

TL;DR: VSRM是一种基于Mamba的视频超分辨率框架，通过空间到时间和时间到空间的Mamba块提取长程时空特征，并引入可变形交叉Mamba对齐模块和频率损失函数，实现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率任务中，CNN和Transformer分别受限于局部感受野和二次复杂度，而Mamba因其长序列建模能力和线性复杂度成为潜在解决方案。

Method: VSRM结合空间到时间和时间到空间的Mamba块提取特征，使用可变形交叉Mamba对齐模块动态对齐帧，并提出频率损失函数优化高频内容。

Result: VSRM在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VSRM为视频超分辨率提供了高效且高性能的解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于无检测器匹配框架的方法，用于直接匹配LiDAR点云和相机图像，解决了模态差距和稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云和图像之间的模态差距以及单帧LiDAR的稀疏性和噪声是现有方法的主要挑战。

Method: 通过将LiDAR强度图投影到2D视图，并利用注意力机制的无检测器匹配网络进行跨模态匹配，同时引入可重复性评分机制提高可靠性。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中表现优异，优于依赖多帧点云的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在单帧LiDAR条件下实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

TL;DR: RGE-GS是一种结合扩散生成与奖励引导高斯积分的新型扩展重建框架，通过奖励网络和差异化训练策略提升重建质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单次驾驶片段扫描不完整及现有3DGS技术扩展时物理不一致和训练效率低的问题。

Method: 提出奖励网络筛选扩散输出，并采用差异化训练策略优化高斯重建过程。

Result: 在公开数据集上实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过创新方法显著提升了场景扩展重建的性能。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型的复杂性和黑盒特性降低了其可解释性，现有方法缺乏有效干预或仅停留在样本层面。

Method: 利用CBM作为可解释框架，通过全局梯度贡献识别和修正有害概念，并将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的可解释性和性能，为人类与神经网络的交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Result: 实验表明CPE在擦除名人、艺术风格和不当内容时优于现有方法，且对其他概念影响小。

Conclusion: CPE能有效擦除目标概念并保护其他概念，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Method: FreqDGT结合频率自适应处理、动态图学习和多尺度时间解缠网络，动态加权情感相关频段，学习特定输入的大脑连接模式，并捕获时间动态。

Result: 实验表明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情感识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过整合频率、空间和时间建模，有效解决了跨被试情感识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is
available at https://github.com/NZWANG/FreqDGT.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping aims to extract the most visually salient regions

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码器提取精确的区域级图像和文本特征，并结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过减少噪声和优化多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D
networks by a significant margin.

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，本文方法（TCA）的平均预期校准误差（ECE）为4.11，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 通过合理初始化和正则化，TCA有效提升了TPT的校准性能，为关键应用提供了更可靠的模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于听众增强的GRPO框架，通过重新评估推理链来校准奖励信号，显著提升了模型在人类视觉偏好任务中的泛化能力和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型在泛化性上表现不佳，监督微调容易导致记忆化问题，需要复杂的标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能改善泛化性，但在推理链与独立视觉语言模型冲突时会出现准确性下降。

Method: 引入听众增强的GRPO框架，听众模型重新评估推理链并提供校准的置信分数，从而调整强化学习的奖励信号，鼓励模型生成更具说服力的解释。

Result: 在ImageReward基准测试中达到67.4%的准确率，显著提升OOD性能（+6%），并减少推理矛盾。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好的对齐提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知GAN技术虽然提供多视角一致性，但缺乏局部编辑能力，因此需要一种能精确控制面部语义的方法。

Method: SemFaceEdit包含几何模块和外观模块，分别生成语义辐射场和RGB辐射场，并通过对抗训练实现语义感知的几何与外观解耦。

Result: 实验表明，SemFaceEdit在语义场编辑和辐射场解耦方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit为面部图像的局部编辑提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Conclusion: FOCUS通过细粒度优化和语义引导，显著提升了行人属性识别的性能与实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Conclusion: DMD-Net是一种高效且鲁棒的网格去噪方法，适用于高噪声环境。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance
embodied intelligence research. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，RES在大规模图像集上计算昂贵，需统一两者。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段为分割感知的图像检索，第二阶段用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）重排序和对象定位。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，检索和分割效果显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和框架有效结合了TIR和RES，提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Conclusion: LiDAR世界模型在多领域转移中具有潜力，新框架显著提升效率和性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化E2EAD奠定了基础，提供了标准化平台，推动以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Motivation: 现有文本引导视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动扭曲和域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR评分，指导潜在优化，避免昂贵的3D注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在显著域转换下表现优异。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过高效建模时空相关性，实现了高质量、一致性的视频编辑。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLM) has paved the
way for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which integrate visual
perception, natural language understanding, and control within a single policy.
Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the
vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的语义信息度量方法，用于量化图像和文本的绝对语义信息量，并重新定义了信息增益的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对比学习是否能表示绝对语义信息量，而不仅仅是关系语义相似性。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的信息增益，提出一种基于嵌入范数的度量方法。

Result: 实验结果显示信息增益得分低的图像多为占位图标，且该方法与CLIP或SigLIP模型高度相关（R²=0.98-1.00）。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适用于公开模型，为量化语义信息提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

TL;DR: CP-Guard是一个针对协作感知（CP）的统一防御框架，通过概率无关的样本共识和动态阈值调整，有效检测和消除恶意代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作感知在多代理系统中提升感知性能，但易受恶意代理攻击，需防御机制保障安全。

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测恶意代理，提升系统可靠性。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了可靠的安全防御方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code

Motivation: 现有方法在医学视觉问答中常生成错误答案，且检索无关内容可能损害模型推理能力，需改进多模态上下文处理。

Method: 提出MOTOR方法，利用基础描述和最优传输技术，结合文本和视觉信息重新排序检索内容。

Result: MOTOR在MedVQA数据集上表现优异，平均准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态检索和重排序显著提升医学视觉问答的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is

reducing latency, and supporting multimodal data remain. This survey outlines
future directions, including hybrid compression frameworks and advanced feature
extraction strategies, to enable more efficient, immersive, and intelligent 3D

Motivation: 现有IMU系统在磁干扰环境中易产生方向估计误差，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用“检测-校正”策略，通过多IMU联合分析检测磁干扰，并利用人体运动先验校正方向误差。

Result: 实验表明，MagShield显著提高了磁干扰下的运动捕捉精度，并具有良好的兼容性。

Conclusion: MagShield能有效提升稀疏惯性运动捕捉系统在磁干扰环境中的性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

Motivation: VPT中图像块嵌入与Transformer自注意力模块的交互导致非高斯分布，影响提示学习效果。

Method: 提出数据白化和双线性建模（BPT），通过低秩分解减少参数和计算开销。

Result: BPT在CUB数据集上准确率提升>25%，且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: BPT优于多种VPT方法，兼具高效性和性能提升。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Motivation: 随着多模态内容的真实性提升，虚假信息变得更加隐蔽，尤其是在双语字幕新闻中，局部图像编辑和跨语言不一致性共同扭曲意义。

Method: BiMi结合区域级定位、跨模态和跨语言一致性检测，并引入在线检索模块增强泛化能力。使用GRPO提升解释质量。

Conclusion: BiMi在多语言虚假信息检测中实现了最先进的性能，并发布了BiMiBench基准和工具。

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,
multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be

with broad consequences in different fields, including catastrophe control,
ecological observation, architecture for cities, and more. Nevertheless, its
several apps, reaching a high degree of accuracy in SC from distant observation

TL;DR: 欧盟预测到2026年90%的在线内容可能是AI生成的，引发对政治虚假信息的担忧。加州AB 3211法案要求对AI生成内容加水印，但现有技术易被篡改。本文提出PECCAVI，一种抗视觉转述攻击的无失真水印技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对AI生成内容的虚假信息风险，尤其是现有水印技术的脆弱性。

Method: PECCAVI通过在多通道频域嵌入水印，并利用噪声打磨保护非熔化点（NMPs），防止攻击者定位和破坏水印。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵抗视觉转述攻击，保持图像无失真。

Conclusion: PECCAVI是一种模型无关的鲁棒水印技术，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 解决现有确定性原型方法在少样本新类上适应性不足的问题。

Method: FewCLIP结合视觉校准原型和分布正则化，实现自适应和不确定性感知的原型学习。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准提升了GFSS的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: AugPaint为有限标注数据下的医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoOpti3DGS通过小波变换限制高斯增殖，保持视觉质量的同时减少内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射方法中高斯基元数量增长导致的内存和带宽压力问题。

Method: 使用可学习的离散小波变换，固定低通滤波器，学习高通滤波器，并通过正交性损失逐步激活细节。

Result: AutoOpti3DGS仅需一个超参数，生成更稀疏的场景表示，适用于内存受限硬件。

Conclusion: AutoOpti3DGS有效平衡了视觉质量与资源消耗，适用于高效3D高斯溅射框架。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: Ovis-U1是一个30亿参数的多模态统一模型，集成了理解、生成和编辑能力，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过统一训练方法提升多模态任务的性能，突破现有模型的局限。

Method: 采用扩散式视觉解码器和双向令牌细化器，基于语言模型进行统一训练。

Result: 在OpenCompass、DPG-Bench等基准测试中表现优异，超越Ristretto-3B等模型。

Conclusion: Ovis-U1为多模态任务提供了高性能的统一解决方案，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出DyME训练范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，以提升小规模视觉语言模型的可靠思维能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于小规模视觉语言模型（SVLMs）参数容量有限且指令跟随能力弱，现有训练范式（如SFT和RLVR）难以直接应用，导致伪思维痕迹和优势崩溃。

Method: 提出DyME范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，确保每次优化更新都能平衡两者。

Result: 实验表明DyME能显著提升SVLMs的性能，实现可靠的思维能力。

Conclusion: DyME是一种实用有效的解决方案，适用于提升SVLMs的可靠思维能力。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles from single-view images remains a
challenging task due to the intricate interwoven structure and complex
topologies of braids. Existing strand-based hair reconstruction methods
typically focus on loose hairstyles and often struggle to capture the
fine-grained geometry of braided hair. In this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised pipeline for efficiently reconstructing 3D braided hair from

theory, our approach effectively captures the complex intertwined structures of
braids. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, providing superior accuracy, realism, and
efficiency in reconstructing 3D braided hairstyles, supporting expressive
hairstyle modeling in digital humans.

Conclusion: CDAL通过最大化因果效应，有效捕捉了泛化到未见源模型的生成模式，计算开销小且性能优越。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Method: 构建DA-Campus基准数据集，将问题形式化为跨域的分层检索任务，并提出动态对比学习框架（DyCL）逐步对齐特征表示。

Result: DyCL在分层检索性能和跨视角地理定位准确性上均显著提升，且与现有多尺度度量学习方法高度互补。

Conclusion: DyCL为解决复杂空间关系下的地理定位问题提供了有效方法，并通过公开代码和基准数据集支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Motivation: 当前成像技术和脊柱结构的复杂性导致现有方法难以减少图像模糊的影响并区分相似脊椎，需要更精确的分割方法。

Method: 使用小波变换进行无损下采样，分别处理高频和低频分量：高频分量通过HFR放大关键特征并过滤噪声；低频分量通过MG-SSM聚合不同感受野的特征，捕获长距离依赖。

Result: 实验表明，FMC-Net在CT和MRI脊椎分割数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMC-Net通过频率增强和多粒度上下文处理，显著提高了脊椎分割的准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中表现不佳，需要一种方法优化其性能。

Method: DC-TTA将用户交互划分为更一致的子集，通过分而治之策略独立处理每个子集，最后合并模型。

Result: DC-TTA显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效解决了SAM在复杂场景中的局限性，提升了交互分割的效果。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了多笔画汉字简化的潜力，为未来更系统化的简化策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

Conclusion: CVC-RF框架为颈动脉斑块分级提供了高效解决方案，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在三个主要问题：因果注意力不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标记数据导致扩展性差、训练目标和数据多样性不足。

Method: MoCa分为两个阶段：1）模态感知的持续预训练，通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文感知；2）异构对比微调，利用多样化多模态数据提升泛化和对齐能力。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新的SOTA结果，并在模型规模和训练数据上展现出强扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标记数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to

TL;DR: AlignCVC通过分布对齐改进单图像到3D生成，提出软硬对齐策略，显著提升跨视图一致性和生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖回归损失，但中间多视图图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），影响3D重建效果。

Method: 引入AlignCVC框架，通过分布对齐而非严格回归损失，提出软硬对齐策略，分别优化生成和重建模型。

Result: 实验证明AlignCVC显著提升CVC和生成质量，推理速度加快至4步。

Conclusion: AlignCVC为单图像到3D生成提供了高效、高质量的解决方案，兼容多种模型。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

*Huiqiang Sun,Xingyi Li,Juewen Peng,Liao Shen,Zhiguo Cao,Ke Xian,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布深度正则化（DDR）的方法，解决了动态3D场景中相机运动范围有限时的几何表示和相机参数估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法在相机运动范围有限时表现不佳，主要面临几何表示错误和相机参数估计不准确的问题。

Method: 提出DDR方法，通过Gumbel-softmax采样点并约束体积密度，同时引入相机参数学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在小相机运动输入下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DDR方法有效解决了小相机运动场景下的新视角合成问题。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在样本质量和数量有限的情况下，线性微调和迁移学习验证了方法的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签图像上表现出色，为自监督学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Result: 实验验证了该方法在高动态场景重建中的优越性。

Conclusion: 时空解耦框架能有效提升背景与物体的时空区分能力，实现时间连续的动态场景渲染。

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Method: Trident框架采用三元组学习和Siamese网络架构，结合领域对抗训练和伪造判别器，生成伪造无关的表示，避免过拟合。

Result: 在多个基准测试和消融研究中，Trident表现出高效性。

Conclusion: Trident框架通过创新的训练策略和网络设计，显著提升了人脸伪造检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Motivation: 解决Transformer在人物搜索任务中抑制高频特征和高计算成本的问题。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HAMW方法有效提升了模型性能并降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态数据处理框架，并展示了其在实际任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能显式建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不理想。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最优性能，支持更高分辨率和未见物体类别的补全。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过潜在扩散和最优传输路径建模，显著提升了3D形状补全的全局一致性和细节生成能力。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

Result: 在多个户外数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著降低轨迹误差（ATE减少69.0%），并实现高质量渲染。

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM通过几何约束和动态机制显著提升了RGB-only SLAM的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep

incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for
appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient
and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

Result: VolumetricSMPL在推理速度、GPU内存占用、精度和接触建模方面显著优于COAP模型，并在多个任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在广泛任务中展现出高性能和高效性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

Conclusion: SATs填补了局部与全局解释之间的空白，为图像分类器的分析和调试提供实用工具。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

Motivation: 大规模超级计算机模拟中，通信延迟是主要瓶颈，但现有分析方法依赖管理员才能获取的物理链路层信息，限制了普通用户的分析能力。

Method: PCLVis利用MPI通信数据，通过空间定位、通信依赖DAG构建和滑动窗口算法分析PCL事件，并设计CS-Glyph展示通信状态。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上的模拟中，PCLVis有效帮助用户识别和优化通信延迟问题，显著提升模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了一种无需物理链路层信息的通信延迟分析工具，能够显著改善大规模模拟的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the
efficiency of their simulations.

Motivation: 理解交通事故的因果关系对自动驾驶汽车的安全至关重要，但将真实视频中的因果关系融入合成视频仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出Causal-VidSyn模型，利用因果描述和驾驶员注视点，通过事故原因回答和注视条件选择模块实现因果实体定位。

Result: Causal-VidSyn在帧质量和因果敏感性方面优于现有视频扩散模型，支持多种任务如视频编辑和文本到视频生成。

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn为合成具有因果关系的交通事故视频提供了有效方法，推动了自动驾驶安全测试的发展。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，通过因果推理和高斯滤波减少多模态大语言模型(MLLM)解释中的冗余激活干扰，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM的解释性不足，影响了模型的可信度和可视化效果，现有方法未解决上下文冗余激活干扰的问题。

Method: 提出TAM方法，利用因果推理和高斯滤波减少冗余激活干扰，考虑token间的交互作用。

Result: TAM在多种场景下表现优异，如目标定位、失败案例分析、视频可视化等，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAM为MLLM提供了高质量的解释和可视化工具，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and

At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative

Conclusion: MoMa通过全时空建模显著提升了视频理解性能，同时保持高效计算。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our

TL;DR: FastSeg提出了一种高效的训练自由框架，通过预训练扩散模型实现快速分割，结合双提示机制和分层注意力优化，显著提升了分割质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放词汇语义分割中全局表示偏差和扩散模型迭代次数与分割质量平衡的问题。

Method: 采用(1+1)步反向扩散过程，结合双提示机制、分层注意力优化和测试时翻转方案。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到43.8%的平均mIoU，同时保持高效推理。

Conclusion: FastSeg在分割质量和效率之间取得了平衡，为扩展性提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

TL;DR: IR3D-Bench是一个新的基准测试，挑战视觉语言模型通过主动创建3D结构来展示场景理解能力，而非被动识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型是否真正理解场景，而不仅仅是描述或对话。

Method: 基于分析-合成范式，要求视觉语言代理使用编程和渲染工具主动重建输入图像的3D结构。

Result: 初步实验显示当前模型在视觉精度上存在局限，而非基本工具使用。

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统研究和开发工具使用的视觉语言代理提供了数据和评估协议，以促进真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational
capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a
comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial
relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments
on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight
current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool
usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to
facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine
scene understanding by creating.

TL;DR: 论文提出CycleVAR方法，通过Softmax Relaxed Quantization解决传统量化方法梯度中断问题，实现无监督图像翻译的端到端优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件自回归图像生成方法在无监督图像翻译领域潜力未充分挖掘，传统量化方法导致梯度中断，阻碍优化。

Method: 提出Softmax Relaxed Quantization，将码本选择转化为连续概率混合过程；设计CycleVAR，通过多尺度源图像标记实现图像条件自回归生成。

Result: 并行单步生成模式在无监督场景下优于串行多步模式，CycleVAR超越现有最佳模型如CycleGAN-Turbo。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过梯度保留和并行生成显著提升无监督图像翻译性能。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

Conclusion: GeoProg3D是首个通过自然语言实现城市规模高保真3D场景组合地理推理的框架。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

Motivation: 红外图像在复杂天气条件下（如雾、雨、低光）能提升自动驾驶感知能力，但低对比度问题（尤其是非发热目标）影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: 方法包括分层分解和基于形态学重建的显著性提取，前者增强细节并保留暗区特征，后者有效提取目标信息且不放大噪声。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主体场景，且缺乏对多主体训练数据和控制信号（如深度、遮罩等）的研究。

Method: 提出VideoCus-Factory数据构建管道，开发IVTM混合训练策略，并设计OmniVCus框架（包含Lottery Embedding和Temporally Aligned Embedding机制）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了多主体视频定制和控制信号利用的挑战，为视频编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享编码器和离散解码器设计，显著加速INR视频编码速度20-30倍，同时保持重建质量和压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR编码方法速度慢且牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制，阻碍实际应用。

Method: SIEDD采用共享编码器捕捉全局低频特征，并行训练轻量解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，SIEDD实现20-30倍编码速度提升，保持重建质量和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供可行路径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时的不准确问题，尤其是空间配置的错位。

Result: PSE指标比传统方法更符合人类判断，PSG显著提升了模型在空间关系生成上的表现。

Conclusion: PoS框架有效提升了文本到图像模型在空间关系生成中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 传统目标检测方法无法有效识别分布外（OOD）物体，可能导致自动驾驶车辆误判或漏检，存在安全隐患。

Method: 通过物体相对于自动驾驶车辆的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非具体类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，从而提升自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中的决策能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过危害性判定增强了自动驾驶车辆对未知物体的响应能力，提高了安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Result: PathDiff在图像保真度、文本-图像对齐和忠实度方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathDiff为下游任务（如核分割和分类）提供了有效的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Result: 在两个公共医学数据集的四个分割任务上，CLDF方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CLDF通过结合扩散模型和对比学习，有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的噪声和边界问题。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Result: 在TAMP-Street数据集上，InDiTE-Diff显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InDiTE-Diff为时间变化图像修复提供了有效解决方案，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Result: 在Factorynet数据集上，VLSR成功识别问题标签并提升一致性，显著减少标签词汇量。

Conclusion: VLSR框架以最小人工干预提升数据集质量，适用于工业应用中的鲁棒模型训练。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在医学图像分类中表现优异，但存在种族和性别等公平性问题，可能导致诊断结果偏差。

Method: 提出AdFair-CLIP框架，利用对抗性特征干预抑制敏感属性，减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上，AdFair-CLIP显著提高了公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和少样本场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型设定了公平性学习的新标准，尤其在胸部X光分析中。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

TL;DR: GeoCD是一种基于拓扑感知和完全可微分的测地距离近似方法，用于改进3D点云学习中的Chamfer Distance（CD）指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chamfer Distance（CD）虽然简单高效，但其仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特性。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知且完全可微分的测地距离近似方法，用于替代CD。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在不同架构和数据集上均显著提升了重建质量，仅需一个epoch的微调即可在多指标上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的改进CD的方法，能够更好地捕捉3D形状的几何特性。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 解决Implicit Neural Representation (INR)的高GPU资源需求及GaussianImage训练慢和固定高斯点数量的问题。

Method: 使用网络快速生成粗略高斯表示，再进行少量微调，动态调整高斯点数量以适应图像复杂度。

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，渲染性能与GaussianImage相当或更优，训练时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM)
specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving
performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale
VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for
consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while

several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B

Motivation: CLIP在图像-文本匹配任务中表现优异，但缺乏对细粒度动作的理解能力，限制了其在描述对象状态或关系中的应用。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的动作相关知识，并通过自适应交互模块聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入动作感知提示和LLM知识，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度动作理解上的性能。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: 通过注视信息的引入和弱监督下的时空建模，显著提升了视频显著物体检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低复杂度，高效利用时间信息，提升了自动驾驶的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including

effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

TL;DR: GVIT是一种分类框架，用可学习的2D高斯表示替代传统像素或补丁网格输入，结合ViT分类器，性能接近传统ViT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT依赖像素或补丁网格输入，GVIT旨在通过更紧凑的高斯表示提升效率和性能。

Method: 图像编码为数百个高斯参数，位置、尺度、方向等与ViT分类器联合优化，利用梯度引导高斯聚焦关键区域。

Result: GVIT在Imagenet-1k上达到76.9% top-1准确率，性能接近传统ViT。

Conclusion: GVIT通过高斯表示和梯度引导，实现了高效且性能接近传统方法的分类框架。

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D超声的智能系统，用于自动平面定位和先天性子宫异常（CUA）诊断，结合去噪扩散模型和强化学习框架，显著提升了诊断效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先天性子宫异常（CUAs）可能导致不孕、流产等严重问题，传统2D超声难以准确评估，3D超声提供了更好的可视化手段。

Method: 1) 使用去噪扩散模型结合局部和全局引导；2) 引入强化学习框架提取关键切片；3) 通过文本驱动的不确定性建模优化分类概率。

Result: 在大规模3D子宫超声数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了平面定位和CUA诊断的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为CUA诊断提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动不变图融合的ToF深度去噪网络，通过跨帧几何注意力增强时间稳定性和空间清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单帧或多帧处理中未考虑深度变化，导致时间不一致和空间模糊。

Method: 利用图结构的时域自相似性进行图融合，结合图像平滑先验和ToF噪声分布，构建最大后验问题并展开为迭代滤波器。

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集和真实Kinectv2数据集上均表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在ToF深度去噪中实现了高精度和一致性，且具有可解释性。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小和线性投影，优化了DiTs的计算成本，同时保持生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统DiTs中固定patch大小导致的计算效率问题，提出动态调整patch大小以适应不同噪声水平。

Method: 引入Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow)，根据噪声水平动态调整patch大小，并为每个patch大小学习线性投影。

Result: 训练结果显示，PPFlow在推理速度上提升1.6-2.0倍，同时保持相似的生成性能。

Conclusion: PPFlow是一种高效且性能优越的DiTs优化方法，适用于从头训练或基于预训练模型的微调。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Oneta的多风格图像增强算法，通过两步操作（强度增强和色彩校正）实现高性能，并支持多种风格任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务的挑战，提出一种简单但高效的算法。

Method: Oneta采用两步操作：强度增强（使用eigenTF）和色彩校正（使用CCM），并通过Y-Net和C-Net预测参数。支持K种风格，每种风格对应一个可学习token。

Result: 实验表明，Oneta能有效完成六种图像增强任务，覆盖30个数据集。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种高效且通用的多风格图像增强算法，性能优越。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LH2Face的新型损失函数，用于解决当前人脸识别系统中硬样本处理不足的问题，通过自适应边缘和概率分布优化，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别算法在处理硬样本时表现不佳，且现有方法未考虑人脸质量或识别难度，导致训练策略过于统一。

Method: 提出LH2Face损失函数，结合vMF分布的概率密度函数对数作为相似性度量，引入自适应边缘的多分类方法，并使用代理损失函数优化表示空间分布。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上，LH2Face的准确率达到49.39%，比第二名方法高出2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应边缘和概率分布优化，显著提升了硬高质量人脸识别的性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码将2D特征隐式转换为3D空间，限制了检测性能。受辐射场在3D重建中的成功启发，作者尝试将其用于增强3D几何估计能力。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），通过渲染前景物体的辅助任务增强3D体素特征，并利用高度感知不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D前景BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过聚焦前景物体和优化特征增强策略，显著提升了多视图3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

TL;DR: MWT-Diff是一种结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换的卫星图像超分辨率框架，通过MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，逐步重建高分辨率图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率卫星图像获取受限于传感器时空限制和高成本，影响环境监测、灾害响应等应用。

Method: 提出MWT-Diff框架，结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换，利用MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，指导分层扩散动态重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，通过FID和LPIPS等感知质量指标验证。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于详细遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Result: 在EV-UAV数据集上的实验证明了方法的优越性，为未来研究提供了基准。

Conclusion: EV-UAV数据集和EV-SpSegNet为事件相机的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案，推动了相关领域的研究。

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现了最先进的性能，提升了训练速度、稳定性和收敛性。

Conclusion: StackCLIP方法在零样本异常检测和分割任务中表现出色，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测在安全敏感应用中至关重要，但易受物理可实现攻击（如对抗性补丁和纹理）的威胁。现有对抗训练研究多集中于分类模型，针对目标检测器的防御研究较少且局限。

Method: 提出PBCAT方法，结合小区域梯度引导对抗补丁和全局不可察觉扰动，统一防御多种物理可实现攻击。

Result: 实验表明，PBCAT显著优于现有防御方法，对抗性纹理攻击下的检测准确率提升29.7%。

Conclusion: PBCAT为防御物理可实现攻击提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在解释视觉信息时经常产生与视觉信息不符的内容（对象幻觉），现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注和训练成本，或增加推理时间。

Method: 提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI)，利用LVLMs对标题查询的注意力激活模式，增强其视觉感知能力。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CAI在生成和判别任务上均实现了最先进的幻觉缓解性能，且仅增加少量推理成本。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且无需额外训练的幻觉缓解方法，显著提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Conclusion: SG-LDM为激光雷达点云生成和翻译提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了数据增强和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic
experiments demonstrate that SG-LDM significantly outperforms existing lidar
diffusion models and the proposed lidar translation framework further improves
data augmentation performance in the downstream lidar segmentation task.

*Shiqi Zhang,Sha Zhang,Jiajun Deng,Yedong Shen,Mingxiao MA,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGOV3D提出了一种新的两阶段训练框架，通过从部分场景到全局场景的课程学习，提升开放词汇3D语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多视角图像仅作为开放词汇信息传递的中介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视角对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: PGOV3D采用两阶段训练：第一阶段在部分场景（密集语义但简单几何）预训练，利用多模态大语言模型和2D分割基础模型生成开放词汇标签；第二阶段在完整场景微调，通过伪标签桥接语义差距。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中，PGOV3D表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过部分到全局的课程学习和多模态监督，显著提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的效果。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS通过结构注意力从随机初始化直接进行3D重建，解决了3DGS依赖高质量点云的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖SfM生成的高质量点云，在纹理缺失或视角受限的场景中表现不佳，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出AttentionGS框架，结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，从随机初始化直接重建3D场景，并使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密度化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在点云初始化不可靠的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: AttentionGS为3DGS在现实应用中提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成上表现优异，但计算效率低下，TurboVSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量；引入分解条件降低训练复杂度；将预训练扩散模型转换为快捷模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR在性能上与现有最佳方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，仅需7秒处理2秒1080p视频，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR通过高效设计，显著提升了视频超分辨率的计算效率，同时保持了高质量的输出。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

Motivation: 现有音频中心Transformer方法在音频-视觉分割中存在感知模糊和视觉细节丢失的局限性。

Method: 提出VCT框架，利用视觉驱动的查询迭代获取音频和视觉信息，并引入PPQG模块生成语义感知和视觉丰富的查询。

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性和细节保留能力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Result: 扩散模型展现出创造性融合能力，但不同方法在不同条件下表现各异。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有显著的组合潜力，但对输入变化敏感。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Conclusion: 通过统一视觉和文本表征，推动了更高效的多模态基础模型发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述往往不可得。

Method: 设计基于Chain-of-Thoughts的提示从MLLMs获取描述，并提出原型条件机制增强生成器鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集上的实验验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过外部知识和原型条件机制提升了医学图像生成的质量和多样性。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Conclusion: MReg在MR诊断中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法依赖梯度或代理模型导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 基于浅层特征评估样本重要性，动态剪枝不重要样本，仅保留重要样本进行后续计算。

Result: 在ImageNet上，剪枝40%数据时，PFB提升0.5%准确率并减少33%训练时间。

Conclusion: PFB在性能和速度上显著优于现有方法，是一种高效的无损训练加速方案。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: Vision Transformer的高计算成本使其在资源有限的硬件上不实用，传统剪枝方法在未见数据域上表现不佳。

Method: 提出P3B方法，利用块级相对贡献全局分配参数资源，识别低影响组件并保留关键部分。

Result: P3B在高稀疏度（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，在迁移学习任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，能有效平衡计算成本和性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Result: 该方法在ACM MM25的对抗攻击竞赛中获得第一名，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了扩散模型在对抗样本生成中的泛化和迁移性问题，适用于更广泛的任务。

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

Result: 在T2V和I2V设置下，SynMotion优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合优化语义和视觉表示，有效解决了运动定制中的复杂性和语义混淆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark
with diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V
settings demonstrate that \method outperforms existing baselines. Project page:

*Smriti Joshi,Richard Osuala,Lidia Garrucho,Kaisar Kushibar,Dimitri Kessler,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于补丁的多视图协同训练方法，用于单图像测试时适应，解决了临床场景中实时推理的需求，并在乳腺MRI肿瘤分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床环境中需要实时适应新领域，但现有方法依赖大数据集且无法充分利用医学影像的立体信息。

Method: 通过不确定性引导的自训练实现特征和预测一致性，仅需单张测试图像即可进行有效的立体分割。

Result: 在三个公开乳腺MRI数据集上，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice相似系数提升3.75%。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床实时推理中具有实用价值，代码已开源，易于集成到nnUNet框架。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjective Camera 是一种通过结合语言描述和渐进草图重建真实场景的方法，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在用户主观输入偏差、草图与3D先验之间的模态鸿沟以及草图质量敏感性问题，需要资源密集型模型调整或高精度草图要求。

Method: 通过概念顺序生成，建立外观先验并通过文本奖励优化，实现序列感知的解耦生成，同时利用潜在优化桥接草图和3D先验的模态鸿沟。

Result: 在多样数据集上的评估表明，该方法在语义和空间一致性上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Subjective Camera 提供了一种无需训练的方式，有效处理用户主观期望，且对草图质量要求低。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跨模型协同学习框架COCA，用于测试时适应（TTA），通过结合不同模型的互补知识提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨模型知识如何影响TTA过程，发现不同模型可以提供互补知识，即使模型规模差异显著。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含两个策略：1）协同适应，整合其他模型的互补知识；2）自我适应，通过无监督学习增强各模型的独特优势。

Result: 实验表明，COCA显著提升了现有方法的性能，例如将ViT-Base在ImageNet-C上的适应准确率从51.7%提高到64.5%。

Conclusion: COCA作为一种即插即用模块，有效利用跨模型知识提升TTA性能，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 视频身份定制任务面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战，现有方法难以同时满足这两点。

Method: 提出Proteus-ID框架，包括多模态身份融合模块（MIF）、时间感知身份注入机制（TAII）和自适应运动学习策略（AML）。

Result: 实验表明，Proteus-ID在身份保持、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID为视频身份定制设立了新基准，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 开放词汇目标检测器在安全关键应用中存在局限性，但真实数据难以提供系统性评估，因此需要合成数据来探索模型的边界。

Method: 设计了两个自动化流程，使用稳定扩散技术生成高语义多样性的图像内容，并基于WordNet和ChatGPT采样对象。在合成数据上评估了多种开放词汇目标检测器和经典检测器。

Result: 合成数据能有效挑战开放词汇检测器，发现其容易忽略对象且对对象位置的依赖强于语义。

Conclusion: 合成数据为挑战和改进开放词汇检测器提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态跟踪算法依赖高复杂度Vision Transformer架构，导致计算开销大且跨模态交互效果有限。

Method: 设计轻量级Prompt Generator生成模态特定提示向量，结合Vision Mamba的FEMamba主干网络实现特征提取与融合。

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

Motivation: 解决罕见类别难以用文本描述且预训练数据中几乎不存在的问题，同时保持模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用多尺度文本化块和多阶段融合策略，将视觉示例信息转化为文本化视觉标记，指导OVLMs。

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准测试（PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在保持OVLMs原有架构和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了少样本场景下的性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在真实遥感图像中面临分辨率差异和地物变化的挑战，导致生成效果不佳或过度依赖参考图像。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，提出双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并引入Better Start策略加速推理。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升了场景分类和语义分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过创新设计和高效推理，为遥感图像超分辨率提供了更灵活和强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用已知相机标定的方法，通过引入成对相对旋转估计，实现无初始化校准SfM，生成接近度量精度的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无初始化BA方法因无法利用相机标定信息，仅能生成投影变换下的解，且需要更多数据。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入成对相对旋转估计，结合pOSE框架，实现无初始化的校准SfM，生成接近度量精度的重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标，从随机初始解高概率收敛到全局最优，生成准确的近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合旋转平均与pOSE框架，实现了无初始化且校准的SfM，显著提升重建精度。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Conclusion: 该方法在医学领域首次展示了SigLIP损失的适应性，并通过消融实验验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

Result: 实验表明，LaZSL在解释性、准确性和领域泛化能力方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LaZSL为可解释零样本学习提供了一种有效方法，兼具高性能和解释性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，并显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream在长视频理解和实时响应方面具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Conclusion: NH2ST能有效捕捉复杂空间和跨模态关系，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 该学习机制可推广至NLP任务，为深度学习提供新见解，实验基于CIFAR-100数据集验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

TL;DR: PointSSIM是一种低维图像对比度量方法，具有分辨率不变性，适用于不同分辨率的二值图像比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在不同分辨率二值图像比较中的局限性，提供更鲁棒的对比方式。

Method: 通过将二值图像转换为标记点模式表示，提取关键特征（锚点），并使用总结向量进行图像比较。

Result: PointSSIM在图像比较中表现出高效性和可靠性，特别适用于跨分辨率的结构分析。

Conclusion: PointSSIM为跨分辨率图像比较提供了一种有效的解决方案，适用于需要结构分析的应用。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAISE是一种新颖的3D增强框架，利用3D生成先验恢复缺失视角下的细粒度物体几何和外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景重建中因视角缺失导致的高保真物体级建模难题，以支持需要详细物体理解的下游任务。

Method: 通过3D生成模型替换退化物体，分两阶段优化几何和纹理：7-DOF位姿对齐和注册约束增强。

Result: 在新型视图合成和几何补全任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAISE能够高效恢复缺失视角下的物体细节，同时保持场景一致性。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了机器人生成内容（RGC）的概念，并建立了首个RGC视频数据库（RGCD），用于评估RGC视频的感知质量。通过主观实验和基准测试，发现现有视频质量评估（VQA）模型在RGC视频上表现不佳，呼吁开发RGC专用的VQA模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人平台的普及，机器人生成的视频（RGC）在流媒体平台上出现，但其独特的失真和视觉需求未被现有研究覆盖，亟需专门的视频质量评估方法。

Method: 建立包含2,100个RGC视频的数据库（RGCD），进行主观VQA实验，并评估11种现有VQA模型的表现。

Result: 实验表明，现有VQA模型在RGC视频上表现不佳，凸显了开发RGC专用模型的必要性。

Conclusion: RGCD为RGC视频质量评估提供了基础，未来需开发针对RGC的VQA模型以支持更广泛的机器人应用。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一框架，解决了神经表面重建中的多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强导致的结构退化问题，通过微分可见性验证、平面共形正则化和物理基础的Eikonal松弛实现了协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景下难以同时保证几何保真度和光度一致性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一框架解决多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强的问题。

Method: 1) SDF引导的射线追踪实现微分可见性验证；2) 射线对齐几何块的平面共形正则化；3) 基于局部辐射梯度的物理基础Eikonal松弛。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离减少21.4%，PSNR提升2.32 dB，能恢复镜面物体、厘米级城市布局和无纹理表面。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过协同优化实现了几何与外观约束的统一，适用于逆向渲染任务，如材质分解和视角一致重光照。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)，通过基于文本类别信息（TCI）的动态提示解决Base-New Tradeoff问题，显著提升模型在新任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息（VII）的条件提示调优方法表现不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示，研究发现TCI是解决BNT问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习TCI条件的动态提示，快速适应新类别，并可作为插件提升现有无条件提示调优方案。

Result: 在11个数据集上，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，且额外计算成本可忽略。结合DePT框架的DeCaPT方法在性能上超越现有最优条件提示调优方案3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI条件提示有效解决了BNT问题，是一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VMoBA的新型稀疏注意力机制，旨在解决视频扩散模型中全注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，显著提升了训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全注意力机制在视频扩散模型中的高复杂度限制了长时长、高分辨率视频的生成效率。现有稀疏注意力方法未能充分适应视频数据的时空特性。

Method: VMoBA通过分析预训练视频变换器的注意力模式，提出了三种改进：动态分块方案、全局块选择和基于阈值的块选择。

Result: VMoBA显著提升了训练效率（2.92x FLOPs和1.48x延迟加速），并在推理中实现了2.40x FLOPs和1.35x延迟加速，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA是一种高效且适应视频数据特性的稀疏注意力机制，为视频扩散模型提供了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUST3R）的性能受限于训练数据的多样性和规模，需要一种能增强数据多样性的策略。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和真实场景几何，Puzzles从单张图像或视频片段合成高质量数据。

Result: 实验表明，Puzzles显著提升性能，仅用10%原始数据即可达到与完整数据相当的精度。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强方法，无需修改网络架构即可提升3D重建性能。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有OOD检测方法易受虚假相关性误导的问题，提高模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SPROD方法，通过后处理优化类别原型，减少虚假特征的偏差。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，AUROC提升4.7%，FPR@95降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SPROD是一种高效且通用的OOD检测方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真而性能下降，尤其是在极地区域。

Method: 提出PriOr-Flow框架，采用DCCL操作符从原始和正交成本体积中联合检索相关性信息，并引入ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征。

Result: PriOr-Flow在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，兼容多种迭代光流方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow通过双分支设计和失真补偿模块，显著提升了全景光流估计的准确性，为宽视场运动估计设定了新基准。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on

Motivation: 深度学习在脑成像中表现优异，但其在不同成像队列中的泛化能力尚未充分评估。年龄和性别是临床神经科学中的关键生物标志物，因此研究评估了不同架构在这些任务上的表现。

Method: 研究评估了三种3D架构（SFCN、DenseNet和Swin Transformer）在四个独立队列（UKB、DLBS、PPMI、IXI）中的年龄和性别预测能力。

Result: SFCN在性别分类和年龄预测任务中均表现最佳，尤其是在跨数据集测试中。

Conclusion: 简单的卷积网络在脑图像分析中优于复杂架构，展示了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态AI的未来发展提供了清晰的路线图，旨在实现更强大且与人类认知对齐的智能系统。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

### [338] [Toward Simple and Robust Contrastive Explanations for Image Classification by Leveraging Instance Similarity and Concept Relevance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23975)
*Yuliia Kaidashova,Bettina Finzel,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于概念的对比解释方法，用于图像分类，探讨了概念相关性与解释复杂度之间的关系，并测试了图像增强对解释鲁棒性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解分类模型为何对某一输入实例偏好某一类别是对比解释的挑战，旨在通过人类可理解的概念提升模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 利用实例嵌入的相似性和微调深度学习模型使用的概念相关性，提取概念及其相关性分数，计算相似实例的对比，并基于解释复杂度评估结果。

Result: 高概念相关性导致更短、更简单的解释，而低相关性则产生更长、更分散的解释；解释在不同图像增强下表现出不同程度的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建更具可解释性和鲁棒性的AI系统提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental

Motivation: 环境在时间和空间上的持续变化对基于封闭集假设训练的目标检测器提出了挑战，需要一种更高效的适应机制。

Method: 设计了双路径LoRA域感知适配器分离特征，提出条件扩散参数生成机制，并采用类中心最优传输对齐方法减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多种连续域自适应目标检测任务中验证了有效性，生成的参数能捕获更多目标相关信息并增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过参数生成机制和特征分离，显著提升了目标检测器在动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中容易受认知偏见影响，导致设计空间局部最优。IT-Blender旨在自动化这一过程，弥补现有方法在细节保留和解耦输入方面的不足。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型（SD和FLUX），将干净参考图像的潜在表示与噪声生成图像混合，结合新型混合注意力机制，实现细节保留和解耦混合。

Result: 实验表明，IT-Blender在视觉与文本概念混合上大幅优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IT-Blender展示了生成模型在增强人类创造力方面的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRA是一种基于小波变换的参数高效微调方法，通过多分辨率分析改进LoRA，在视觉任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉权重更新的复杂模式。

Method: WaRA利用小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在频域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重构更新。

Result: WaRA在图像生成、分类和语义分割等任务中表现优于现有方法，同时降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: WaRA不仅适用于视觉任务，还能泛化到语言任务，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通过昂贵的后处理步骤提取表面，导致几何细节丢失或生成密集网格，限制了最终网格保留训练期间捕获的所有几何结构的能力。

Method: MILo设计了一种完全可微分的过程，直接从高斯参数构建网格（包括顶点位置和连接性），并引入双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取过程和基于高斯的有符号距离计算方法。

Result: 该方法能够以最先进的质量重建完整场景，包括背景，且所需网格顶点数量比先前方法少一个数量级。

Conclusion: MILo生成的网格轻量且内部为空，适用于物理模拟或动画等下游应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M为社区提供了首个大规模、详细且密集的标注数据集，其标注方法和模型显著提升了标注效率和质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Motivation: 现有基于视频扩散的世界模型难以处理灵活长度和长时程预测，且无法整合轨迹规划。

Method: 提出Epona模型，采用解耦时空因子化和模块化轨迹视频预测，结合链式前向训练策略。

Result: 实验显示FVD提升7.4%，预测时长显著延长，并在NAVSIM基准测试中优于端到端规划器。

Conclusion: Epona在视频生成和自动驾驶规划中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.
The code will be released to facilitate future research in text-to-4D

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory

ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and

Motivation: 传统INR方法因需要逐样本训练网络，编码速度过慢，难以实用化。研究旨在解决这一问题，同时优化压缩性能。

Method: 开发了一个库来分析NeRV家族方法的组件，提出RNeRV配置，并探索超网络技术以预测INR权重，实现实时编码。

Result: RNeRV在相同训练时间下，PSNR平均提升1.27%；超网络技术进一步提升了PSNR和MS-SSIM，同时保持编码速度。

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络技术显著提升了INR视频压缩的实用性和性能，为实时编码提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

Motivation: 在带宽受限环境中，高效模型分发变得至关重要。

Method: 提出Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U)，传输低精度模型及其与原高精度模型的差异更新。

Result: 在多种模型架构和数据集上验证，P$^2$U在准确性、带宽和延迟间取得更好平衡，支持激进量化（如4位）而不显著影响性能。

Conclusion: P$^2$U是低资源环境下高效模型分发的实用解决方案，适用于联邦学习、边缘计算和物联网部署，且可与现有压缩技术互补。

Abstract: Efficient model distribution is becoming increasingly critical in
bandwidth-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this
problem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U
transmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing
the difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted
low precision version. With extensive experiments on various model
architectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a
large model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data
sets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U
consistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and
latency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,
aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising
performance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical
solution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource
settings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.
Given that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be
implemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,
quantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.

ITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,
the latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted
and effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the
standard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to
the influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a
threshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of
Tensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the
model's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to
individual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed
datasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed
TDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
both in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络物理系统在关键基础设施中的重要性日益增加，但其高连接性使其易受复杂网络威胁攻击，传统安全方法效果有限。

Result: 实验表明，HAMARL显著优于传统多智能体强化学习方法，提高了攻击检测准确率并减少了响应时间。

Conclusion: 结合分层多智能体协调和对抗训练可有效增强下一代网络物理系统的安全性和弹性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various
sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous
transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them
highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day
attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion
detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To
overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical
Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework.
HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to
subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes
comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework
incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate
evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive
experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed
indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent
reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection
accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The
results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent
coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and
security of next-generation CPS.

Conclusion: RL-Net是透明性和性能之间的实用折中方案，展示了神经符号模型在可解释AI中的潜力。

Abstract: Rule-based models offer interpretability but struggle with complex data,
while deep neural networks excel in performance yet lack transparency. This
work investigates a neuro-symbolic rule learning neural network named RL-Net
that learns interpretable rule lists through neural optimization, applied for
the first time to radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR). We benchmark
RL-Net against a fully transparent rule-based system (MIRA) and an explainable
black-box model (XentricAI), evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and user
adaptability via transfer learning. Our results show that RL-Net achieves a
favorable trade-off, maintaining strong performance (93.03% F1) while
significantly reducing rule complexity. We identify optimization challenges
specific to rule pruning and hierarchy bias and propose stability-enhancing
modifications. Compared to MIRA and XentricAI, RL-Net emerges as a practical
middle ground between transparency and performance. This study highlights the
real-world feasibility of neuro-symbolic models for interpretable HGR and
offers insights for extending explainable AI to edge-deployable sensing
systems.

Conclusion: 研究目标是通过改进风险预测和进展事件识别，优化SARS-CoV-2患者的护理和决策。

Abstract: The long-term effects of Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, known as PASC,
pose a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Accurate
identification of progression events, such as hospitalization and reinfection,
is essential for effective patient management and resource allocation. However,
traditional models trained on structured data struggle to capture the nuanced
progression of PASC. In this study, we introduce the first publicly available
cohort of 18 PASC patients, with text time series features based on Large
Language Model Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and clinical risk annotated by clinical
expert. We propose an Active Attention Network to predict the clinical risk and
identify progression events related to the risk. By integrating human expertise
with active learning, we aim to enhance clinical risk prediction accuracy and
enable progression events identification with fewer number of annotation. The
ultimate goal is to improves patient care and decision-making for SARS-CoV-2

TL;DR: EAGLE是一种新型深度学习框架，通过注意力机制和多模态融合，解决了癌症生存预测中的计算复杂性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法在融合策略、计算需求和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了临床应用的推广。

Method: EAGLE采用动态跨模态注意力机制、维度大幅减少、三种互补归因方法及统一流程。

Result: 在911名患者中验证，EAGLE能识别高风险患者依赖影像特征，风险分层显示生存差异显著。

Conclusion: EAGLE结合高性能与临床可解释性，为多模态生存预测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate cancer survival prediction requires integration of diverse data
modalities that reflect the complex interplay between imaging, clinical
parameters, and textual reports. However, existing multimodal approaches suffer
from simplistic fusion strategies, massive computational requirements, and lack
of interpretability-critical barriers to clinical adoption. We present EAGLE
(Efficient Alignment of Generalized Latent Embeddings), a novel deep learning
framework that addresses these limitations through attention-based multimodal
fusion with comprehensive attribution analysis. EAGLE introduces four key
innovations: (1) dynamic cross-modal attention mechanisms that learn
hierarchical relationships between modalities, (2) massive dimensionality
reduction (99.96%) while maintaining predictive performance, (3) three
complementary attribution methods providing patient-level interpretability, and
(4) a unified pipeline enabling seamless adaptation across cancer types. We
evaluated EAGLE on 911 patients across three distinct malignancies:
glioblastoma (GBM, n=160), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN,
n=171), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=580). Patient-level analysis
showed high-risk individuals relied more heavily on adverse imaging features,
while low-risk patients demonstrated balanced modality contributions. Risk
stratification identified clinically meaningful groups with 4-fold (GBM) to
5-fold (NSCLC) differences in median survival, directly informing treatment
intensity decisions. By combining state-of-the-art performance with clinical
interpretability, EAGLE bridges the gap between advanced AI capabilities and
practical healthcare deployment, offering a scalable solution for multimodal
survival prediction that enhances both prognostic accuracy and physician trust
in automated predictions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的多任务多变量架构（1EMD），用于联合预测多个气候变量，优于单变量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球气候模型（GCMs）分辨率低，区域气候模型（RCMs）计算成本高且灵活性有限，现有深度学习方法多为单变量模型，缺乏跨变量交互。

Method: 采用共享编码器和变量特定解码器的ViT架构，联合预测表面温度、风速和500 hPa位势高度。

Result: 多变量方法实现了跨变量知识转移，性能优于单变量基线，并提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 多变量建模在高分辨率气候降尺度中具有有效性。

Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate
dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in
regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) refine this through dynamic
downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited
flexibility. While deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven
alternative, most existing studies have focused on single-variable models that
downscale one variable at a time. This approach can lead to limited contextual
awareness, redundant computation, and lack of cross-variable interaction. Our
study addresses these limitations by proposing a multi-task, multi-variable
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and
variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed architecture jointly predicts
three key climate variables: surface temperature (tas), wind speed (sfcWind),
and 500 hPa geopotential height (zg500), directly from GCM-resolution inputs,
emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. We show that our multi-variable
approach achieves positive cross-variable knowledge transfer and consistently
outperforms single-variable baselines trained under identical conditions, while
also improving computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-variable modeling for high-resolution climate
downscaling.

Result: 初步结果显示，微调预训练模型显著优于从头训练，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为关系数据学习可迁移表示提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph
Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by
representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models
typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training
separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and
reuse.
  In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining
approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that
aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level,
link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic
heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective
pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient
sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our
preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the
pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the
promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations
for relational data.

Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In
this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly
shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically
demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from
untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks
and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated
actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss
the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard
architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling
exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for
using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior
in early training.

Result: MIO避免了DPO的后期性能下降，在推理和数学任务中表现优于或持平现有方法。

Conclusion: MIO为LLM对齐提供了新视角，解决了现有方法的不足，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently
garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical
yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both
RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)
maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within
this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform
contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from
the base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI
(equivalently, the MINE estimator). This paradigm further explains why RLHF may
not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is
already present in the base model. Building on this perspective, we replace the
DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator and propose Mutual
Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and
extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage
decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior
performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
We will release the model and code upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练计算成本高，迁移学习中对抗微调仍需大量时间，研究FGSM在对抗微调中的稳定性和效率。

Method: 使用FGSM方法进行对抗微调，并与PGD方法对比，评估其在多个数据集上的性能和稳定性。

Result: FGSM在对抗微调中表现出高稳定性，性能损失小（0.39%-1.39%），训练时间减少4倍。

Conclusion: FGSM是对抗鲁棒性迁移学习中高效且性能良好的替代方法。

Abstract: Transfer learning is often used to decrease the computational cost of model
training, as fine-tuning a model allows a downstream task to leverage the
features learned from the pre-training dataset and quickly adapt them to a new
task. This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as
adversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.
However, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial
training during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of
magnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use
of the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve
the computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that
FGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from
scratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with
catastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\varepsilon=4$ or
$\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\varepsilon=32$ for
linear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance
across multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used
method of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%
and 1.39% test robustness for $\varepsilon=4$ and $\varepsilon=8$ while using
$4\times$ less training time. Surprisingly, FGSM may not only be a
significantly more efficient alternative to PGD in adversarially robust
transfer learning but also a well-performing one.

Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature
domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured.
These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and
optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input
spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical.
A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other
decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical
structures.
  We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose
activation depends on contextual conditions. To capture these inter-variable
hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining
principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition
of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system
architectures. The framework supports the use of surrogate models over such
domains and integrates hierarchical kernels and distances for efficient
modeling and optimization. The proposed methods are implemented in the
open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), and their capabilities are
demonstrated through applications in Bayesian optimization for complex system
design, including a case study in green aircraft architecture.

Conclusion: H-VAW-D算法在非参数领域实现了高效的动态遗憾优化。

Abstract: We study the problem of online regression with the unconstrained quadratic
loss against a time-varying sequence of functions from a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). Recently, Jacobsen and Cutkosky (2024) introduced a
discounted Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth (DVAW) forecaster that achieves optimal dynamic
regret in the finite-dimensional case. In this work, we lift their approach to
the non-parametric domain by synthesizing the DVAW framework with a random
feature approximation. We propose a fully adaptive, hierarchical algorithm,
which we call H-VAW-D (Hierarchical Vovk-Azoury-Warmuth with Discounting), that
learns both the discount factor and the number of random features. We prove
that this algorithm, which has a per-iteration computational complexity of
$O(T\ln T)$, achieves an expected dynamic regret of $O(T^{2/3}P_T^{1/3} +
\sqrt{T}\ln T)$, where $P_T$ is the functional path length of a comparator
sequence.

Conclusion: 数学推理需要预训练中形成的专用层，而非推理任务则无此需求。

Abstract: Large language models can exhibit improved mathematical reasoning
capabilities following post-training with instruction tuning, reinforcement
learning, or knowledge distillation. However, it remains unclear whether these
improvements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor
adjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base
model largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic
layer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,
knowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise
to a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across
all post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up
to 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no
critical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires
specialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning
tasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that
these critical layers are the same layers where major representational
transformation occurs.

Abstract: Machine Learning surrogates have been developed to accelerate solving systems
dynamics of complex processes in different science and engineering
applications. To faithfully capture governing systems dynamics, these methods
rely on large training datasets, hence restricting their applicability in
real-world problems. In this work, we propose BayPOD-AL, an active learning
framework based on an uncertainty-aware Bayesian proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) approach, which aims to effectively learn reduced-order
models from high-fidelity full-order models representing complex systems.
Experimental results on predicting the temperature evolution over a rod
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's effectiveness in suggesting the informative data and
reducing computational cost related to constructing a training dataset compared
to other uncertainty-guided active learning strategies. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BayPOD-AL's generalizability and efficiency by evaluating its
performance on a dataset of higher temporal resolution than the training

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the
resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant
computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires
discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional
state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic
multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly
from observational data. Our method resolves the state on a coarse mesh while
introducing an auxiliary state to capture the effects of unresolved scales. We
learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a modern forward-solver-free
amortized variational inference method. Our approach draws inspiration from
physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, such as large-eddy simulation in
fluid dynamics, while learning directly from data. We present numerical studies
to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive
accuracy compared to direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at
equivalent resolution.

Result: DistShap在准确性上优于现有方法，并首次支持百万级特征的GNN模型，使用多达128个GPU。

Conclusion: DistShap为大规模GNN解释提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), explaining their
predictions has become increasingly important. However, attributing predictions
to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example,
classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve
identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel
algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple
GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting,
executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed
least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms
most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to
GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC
Perlmutter supercomputer.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative
personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept
($V^*$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to
dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only
reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V^*$
wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms
such as "a photo of $V^*$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail
to capture the intended concept.
  We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the
learned embedding $V^*$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in
direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained
embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing
problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization
methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in
diverse use cases. Our code is anonymously published at

*Brian Mak,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RMT的新模型，通过用外积记忆矩阵替换Transformer的残差流，实现了更高的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Transformer中残差流的信息存储和检索机制，以提升模型性能和效率。

Method: 用外积记忆矩阵（Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972）替换Transformer的残差流，构建RMT模型。

Result: RMT在性能上优于传统Transformer，计算量减少58%，参数减少25%，训练token减少41%，且在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: RMT通过优化残差流的扩展和方差传播特性，显著提升了模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

TL;DR: FairMarket-RL结合大型语言模型（LLM）和强化学习（RL），提出了一种公平感知的P2P交易框架，通过实时公平评分优化交易结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有P2P交易方法缺乏确保公平性的鲁棒框架，FairMarket-RL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为实时公平评估器，结合RL训练交易代理，通过FTB和FBS评分优化奖励函数。

Result: 代理在模拟微电网中实现了90%以上的买家需求满足率，公平评分高于0.80，并减少了卖家利润差异。

Conclusion: FairMarket-RL为去中心化能源系统提供了一种可扩展的公平交易解决方案。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for
decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust
frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel
hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P
microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time
fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:
Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness
scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled
{\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that
replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using
Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,
fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and
consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process
demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer
shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its
language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a
large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its
practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven
solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.

<details>

Motivation: 研究神经网络损失景观的几何结构对深度学习的泛化和优化具有重要意义，尤其是线性模式连通性（LMC）现象。然而，参数空间中的对称性（如神经元排列）使得功能等效的模型显得不同，限制了现有方法的范围。

Method: 引入了一个统一框架，涵盖四类对称性：排列、半排列、正交变换和一般可逆映射，扩展了有效重新参数化的范围。

Result: 该框架首次实现了在独立训练的Vision Transformers和GPT-2模型之间发现低或零障碍的线性插值路径。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了损失景观中更深层次的结构，强调了对称性分析在理解模型空间几何中的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central
question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and
optimization. A striking phenomenon is linear mode connectivity (LMC), where
independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-loss paths,
despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often
obscured by symmetries in parameter space -- such as neuron permutations --
which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has
predominantly focused on neuron re-ordering through permutations, but such
approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries
exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we
introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes:
permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general
invertible maps -- broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and
subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this
generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and
zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision
Transformers and GPT-2 models. These results reveal deeper structure in the
loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for
understanding model space geometry.

TL;DR: BEST-Route是一种新型路由框架，通过动态分配查询到不同成本和质量的模型，并生成多个响应以优化成本与性能的权衡，实验显示可节省60%成本且性能下降不到1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）部署成本高，现有路由方法因仅生成单一响应而过度依赖昂贵的大模型，未能充分利用小模型的潜力。

Method: 提出BEST-Route框架，根据查询难度和质量阈值选择模型及生成响应的数量，通过小模型生成多个响应并选择最佳。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法可节省高达60%的成本，性能下降不到1%。

Conclusion: BEST-Route通过动态路由和多响应生成，显著降低成本同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

Result: 在多个真实交通数据集上的实验表明，RTC-GTNLN在同时存在缺失值和噪声的复杂场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RTC-GTNLN通过创新的非凸秩代理和梯度域融合策略，有效解决了交通数据双重退化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences
dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions
and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are
essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications.
while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are
incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios
involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust
Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately
modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is
often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the
suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model
accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2
norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective
low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy,
we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor
L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear
L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via
Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully
exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off
parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of
missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on
multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery
scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限设备提供了一种高效的训练方案，结合量化与FF算法，显著优化了性能与资源消耗。

Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for
decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its
suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural
network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model
inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the
Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to
backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass.
By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF
can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This
paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's
layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we
propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve
model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board
demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in
memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm
that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by
learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of
the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained,
score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable
zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises
a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned
distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given
the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we
apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical
system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally
observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis
on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also
provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that
generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a
coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental
observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery
of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity
measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the
influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼几何框架为生成模型指纹的定义和分析提供了理论基础，并在实践中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

Abstract: We present a novel and detailed dataset on origin-destination annual
migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 43 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

Motivation: 尽管xLSTM在时间序列预测等领域表现出色，但尚未有研究将其用于异常检测。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出xLSTMAD方法，包括编码器和两种解码器变体（预测和重建），并使用MSE和SoftDTW两种损失函数。

Result: 在TSB-AD-M基准测试中，xLSTMAD优于23种基线方法，展示了卓越的准确性。

Conclusion: xLSTMAD首次展示了xLSTM在异常检测中的强大能力，为该领域的新发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive
multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity
needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This
architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless
compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear
memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to
Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM
for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the
first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM
architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder
processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is
devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach,
the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the
reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded
counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions:
Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider
local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We
evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17
real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR.
In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23
popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the
powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way
for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), a prominent approach in Quantum Machine

learning methods. Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to
various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification,
across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical
imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of
renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in
predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides
an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind
turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN
configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and
varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and
tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs
can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases
marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also
reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive
performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable
insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum
machine learning into their work.

Abstract: Learning the structure of Bayesian networks (BNs) from data is challenging,
especially for datasets involving a large number of variables. The recently

structure learning ensemble (SLE), which combines multiple BN structure
learning algorithms, to consistently achieve high learning accuracy. We further
propose an automatic approach called Auto-SLE for learning near-optimal SLEs,
addressing the challenge of manually designing high-quality SLEs. The learned
SLE is then integrated into a D\&D method. Extensive experiments firmly show
the superiority of our method over D\&D methods with single BN structure
learning algorithm in learning large BNs, achieving accuracy improvement
usually by 30\%$\sim$225\% on datasets involving 10,000 variables. Furthermore,
our method generalizes well to datasets with many more (e.g., 30000) variables
and different network characteristics than those present in the training data
for learning the SLE. These results indicate the significant potential of
employing (automatic learning of) SLEs for scalable BN structure learning.

Conclusion: 该框架在时间序列分析中表现出高效性和可解释性，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing
auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and
seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework
from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model
interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm
induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we
reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization
problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a
subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the
search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated
spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying
sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by
developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme
makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision
variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the
MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while
maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the
time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover
both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity
of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly
seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and
precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover
dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea
surface temperature.

Result: 在三个公共多组学数据集上，MAGNET在癌症分类任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGNET通过线性复杂度和适应性解决了多模态缺失问题，为生物数据融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing
modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients.
Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing
modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with
partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality
patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the
number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET
(Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with
partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention
mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their
importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the
number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate
predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal
embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality
missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on
three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world
instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the
state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法因生成和存储多响应导致内存开销大，限制了在硬件受限条件下的扩展性。

Method: 提出Infinite Sampling框架，包括微采样组、连续采样和长度感知调度器。

Result: 实验显示微采样组降低峰值内存50%以上，Infinite Sampling提升吞吐量25%，同时保持完整生成。

Conclusion: Infinite Sampling在内存受限条件下实现了高效稳定的GRPO训练。

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Group Reward Policy
Optimization (GRPO) have proven effective for fine-tuning large language models
(LLMs) with human feedback. However, generating and storing multiple responses
per prompt incurs substantial memory overhead, especially as the sample group
size increases, limiting scalability under constrained hardware.
  We propose Infinite Sampling, a framework that enables efficient and stable
GRPO training by decoupling group size from GPU memory usage. It consists of:
(1) micro sampling groups that decompose large groups into memory-feasible
rounds; (2) continuous sampling that interleaves generation across groups to
improve utilization; and (3) a length-aware scheduler combining
token-conditioned sequence length prediction with a two-stage plan: global
grouping via FPTAS and runtime refill via SJF.
  Experiments show that our Micro Sampling Groups reduce peak memory usage by
over 50% compared to full-group decoding (e.g., from 21.55 GB to 10.64 GB on
Qwen3-1.7B). Building on this, Infinite Sampling improves throughput by over
25% compared to the naive micro sampling group method, reducing decoding steps
while maintaining full-length completions and memory usage. Our hybrid
scheduling ensures efficient and stable GRPO training with larger groups under
realistic GPU memory constraints.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be
susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental
disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating
vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical
vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position,
speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized
machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns.
First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture
temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model
processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors.
Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by
offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and
performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746,
and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model
attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly
threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in
accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in

Abstract: A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is
proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in
high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing
methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters
that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a
projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions
to search over, and a new way to combine results of different direction types.
This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our
empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small
datasets with challenging structures, and on four large benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming
traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing
decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a
promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation,
storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management.
Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and
storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production,
consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the
energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a
realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through
an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the
Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy
outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust
solution for intelligent microgrid management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解偏微分方程(PDE)时精度不足的问题，探究精度限制的来源。

Method: 引入BWLer，通过重心多项式插值建模PDE解，可附加于MLP或完全替代MLP，并结合谱导数和预处理优化训练。

Result: BWLer显著提升精度，在多个PDE问题中RMSE改善达30x至1800x，甚至接近机器精度。

Conclusion: BWLer为PINNs提供了一种结合灵活性与高精度的实用路径，接近经典谱求解器的性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible way to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) with machine learning, yet they still
fall well short of the machine-precision accuracy many scientific tasks demand.
In this work, we investigate whether the precision ceiling comes from the
ill-conditioning of the PDEs or from the typical multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models
the PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be
added on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely
(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we
take derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental
precision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even
MLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above
float64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,
adding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable
accuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully
characterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it
during training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five
benchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for
convection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining
compatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an
explicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave
problems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the
performance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson
problems. Together, these findings point to a practical path for combining the
flexibility of PINNs with the precision of classical spectral solvers.

Conclusion: 为高效LLMs的构建和部署奠定了基础，并开源了Spectra-1.1模型和TriRun内核以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across research and
industry applications, yet their inference efficiency remains a significant
challenge. As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously
improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,
creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we
investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware
training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the
scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that
TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model
parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite
of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained
performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we
propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which
demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,
building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that
accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to
floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of
TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels.
Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient
LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Result: 平均偏差减少43.35%，均方误差显著降低，且优于现有方法如SMOTE。

Conclusion: 特征混合框架高效且无需显式偏差属性识别，未来可应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Bias in predictive machine learning (ML) models is a fundamental challenge
due to the skewed or unfair outcomes produced by biased models. Existing
mitigation strategies rely on either post-hoc corrections or rigid constraints.
However, emerging research claims that these techniques can limit scalability
and reduce generalizability. To address this, this paper introduces a
feature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by
redistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To
assess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained
using cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,
including disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a
standard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an
average bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in
MSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,
benchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that
feature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and
demonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias
attribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the
computational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning
algorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for
real-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary.

Conclusion: 研究为设计鲁棒和反脆弱的强化学习系统提供了基础，展示了定向过滤技术的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by
systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external
stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering
introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while
adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations.
This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust,
or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and
adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these
characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco
continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of
antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress,
demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL
policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future
advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of
Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional
layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional
quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely
been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our
research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,
significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the
introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities
in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing
gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel
architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging
the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by
adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between
quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the
network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide
empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within
QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient
configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers
in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings
suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in
maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step
forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for
both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.

Result: 在多个评估场景中排名第一，推理时间减少30%-50%，CRPS提升3%-12%。

Conclusion: Double-Diffusion模型在空气质量预测中表现出色，为确定性与不确定性的平衡提供了新思路。

Abstract: Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its
spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty.
Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural
Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through
probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right
balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open
question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion
probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air
quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while
precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air
pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative
approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted
from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks
first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with
other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while
enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score
(CRPS).

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否准确内化了人类心理概念，以评估其与人类思维的匹配程度。

Method: 使用43个标准化心理问卷，通过相似性分析和层次聚类评估LLMs的分类准确性。

Result: GPT-4的分类准确率达66.2%，显著优于GPT-3.5（55.9%）和BERT（48.1%），且与人类反应的相关性较高。

Conclusion: 现代LLMs能近似人类心理概念，为开发更可解释的AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities
in producing human-like text. However, it is unclear how accurately these
models internalize concepts that shape human thought and behavior. Here, we
developed a quantitative framework to assess concept alignment between LLMs and
human psychological dimensions using 43 standardized psychological
questionnaires, selected for their established validity in measuring distinct
psychological constructs. Our method evaluates how accurately language models
reconstruct and classify questionnaire items through pairwise similarity
analysis. We compared resulting cluster structures with the original
categorical labels using hierarchical clustering. A GPT-4 model achieved
superior classification accuracy (66.2\%), significantly outperforming GPT-3.5
(55.9\%) and BERT (48.1\%), all exceeding random baseline performance (31.9\%).
We also demonstrated that the estimated semantic similarity from GPT-4 is
associated with Pearson's correlation coefficients of human responses in
multiple psychological questionnaires. This framework provides a novel approach
to evaluate the alignment of the human-LLM concept and identify potential
representational biases. Our findings demonstrate that modern LLMs can
approximate human psychological constructs with measurable accuracy, offering
insights for developing more interpretable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“元因果图”的世界模型，用于统一表示不同潜在世界状态下因果结构的变化规则，并通过好奇心驱动的探索优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中因果机制常因观察窗口狭窄而显得漂移，传统假设单一固定因果机制的世界模型难以适应这种变化。

Method: 引入元因果图作为世界模型，包含多个由潜在状态触发的因果子图，并通过好奇心驱动的干预策略发现和优化这些子图。

Result: 在合成任务和机器人手臂操作任务中，该方法能有效捕捉因果动态变化并泛化到新情境。

Conclusion: 元因果图是一种高效且灵活的世界模型表示方法，适用于动态因果机制的环境。

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has
a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to
every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is
often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow
observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world
model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very
observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal
Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently
encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across
different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of
multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent
state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a
\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta
states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal
relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)
iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven
exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a
challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly
captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously
unseen contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Forget-MI的新型机器遗忘方法，用于多模态医疗数据，通过损失函数和扰动技术实现遗忘，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗AI中，隐私保护至关重要，但现有方法难以从多模态架构中移除敏感数据。

Method: 通过建立损失函数和扰动技术，Forget-MI能够遗忘请求删除的数据的单模态和联合表示，同时保留剩余数据的知识。

Result: Forget-MI在遗忘数据集上的性能、测试数据集上的性能以及成员推理攻击（MIA）方面优于现有方法，MIA降低了0.202，遗忘集的AUC和F1分数分别降低了0.221和0.305。

Conclusion: Forget-MI在实现遗忘的同时，保持了与原始模型相当的测试性能，为医疗数据隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Conclusion: maneuverRecognition包为驾驶动作识别提供了实用的工具，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习系统的安全性至关重要，鲁棒约束马尔可夫决策过程（RCMDPs）框架能够在满足长期约束的同时提供认知不确定性下的保证。

Method: 使用镜像下降策略优化方法，通过策略梯度技术同时优化策略（作为最大化器）和转移核（作为对抗最小化器），在拉格朗日表示的约束MDP中进行优化。

Result: 在基于oracle的RCMDP设置中，获得了平方距离作为Bregman散度的$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$收敛速度，以及熵正则化目标的$\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$收敛速度；在基于样本的RCMDP设置中，获得了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$收敛速度。实验表明，该方法在约束和无约束优化中表现优异，并在鲁棒性测试中显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 镜像下降策略优化方法在鲁棒约束马尔可夫决策过程中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为强化学习系统的安全性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The
newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows
learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees
under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy
optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making
use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser)
and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian
representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance
as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence
rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we
obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate.
Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in
constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are
observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation
algorithms.

Result: SynCheck显著优于传统方法，性能提升4.3%，而传统方法可能导致性能下降13.4%。

Conclusion: 通过量化合成数据质量并优化其使用，可显著提升无线传感任务的性能。

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention for their ability to
produce realistic synthetic data that supplements the quantity of real-world
datasets. While recent studies show performance improvements in wireless
sensing tasks by incorporating all synthetic data into training sets, the
quality of synthetic data remains unpredictable and the resulting performance
gains are not guaranteed. To address this gap, we propose tractable and
generalizable metrics to quantify quality attributes of synthetic data -
affinity and diversity. Our assessment reveals prevalent affinity limitation in
current wireless synthetic data, leading to mislabeled data and degraded task
performance. We attribute the quality limitation to generative models' lack of
awareness of untrained conditions and domain-specific processing. To mitigate
these issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data
utilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model
training. Our evaluation demonstrates that SynCheck consistently outperforms
quality-oblivious utilization of synthetic data, and achieves 4.3% performance
improvement even when the previous utilization degrades performance by 13.4%.

Conclusion: GAMA提升了生成模型的可解释性，支持无负数据的序列设计验证。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models offer a powerful framework for therapeutic
design by efficiently exploring large spaces of biological sequences enriched
for desirable properties. Unlike supervised learning methods, which require
both positive and negative labeled data, generative models such as LSTMs can be
trained solely on positively labeled sequences, for example, high-affinity
antibodies. This is particularly advantageous in biological settings where
negative data are scarce, unreliable, or biologically ill-defined. However, the
lack of attribution methods for generative models has hindered the ability to
extract interpretable biological insights from such models. To address this
gap, we developed Generative Attribution Metric Analysis (GAMA), an attribution
method for autoregressive generative models based on Integrated Gradients. We
assessed GAMA using synthetic datasets with known ground truths to characterize
its statistical behavior and validate its ability to recover biologically
relevant features. We further demonstrated the utility of GAMA by applying it
to experimental antibody-antigen binding data. GAMA enables model
interpretability and the validation of generative sequence design strategies
without the need for negative training data.

Result: 实现了多项式时间经验风险最小化算法，以及高效、稳定且适当的样本压缩方案。

Conclusion: monophonic半空间在可实现的PAC设置中可高效学习，与geodesic半空间的NP难问题形成鲜明对比。

Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding
notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning
community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph
halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a
$2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent
monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this
decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various
learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably,
we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization.
Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and
proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently
learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the
realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature,
and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said
learning problems are NP-hard.

Conclusion: M2oE2通过动态适应外部数据，为负荷预测提供了更高效和鲁棒的解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system
reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility.
However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors,
such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their
heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information.
We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to
dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a
meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected
parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external
conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further
integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through
selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant
external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for
External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and
robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets. The dataset and source code
are publicly available at

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial
intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning
scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of
concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy.
However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently
satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of
different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types
of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or
personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model
optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning
for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round.
This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning,
which includes an optimal proximal term and enables overcoming the catastrophic
forgetting issue in each round by utilizing a reference model that incorporates
previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model
performance and low computing cost.

Motivation: 解决图像修复和超分辨率中缺失像素估计问题，并量化估计的不确定性。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）假设，提出SGKI方法，扩展了现有核方法，并利用Schur补高效计算非渐近置信带。

Result: SGKI不仅能估计缺失像素，还能为所有缺失像素提供同时保证的置信带，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SGKI是一种有效的图像缺失像素估计方法，兼具估计和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

Motivation: 现有门控线性单元（GLU）在大型语言模型中因需要双倍内存读取而成为性能瓶颈，需优化以提升效率。

Method: 引入Masked Gated Linear Units（MGLU），包括元素级混合门控（MoEG）架构和硬件友好的FlashMGLU内核，减少内存传输并加速推理。

Result: MGLU在RTX5090 GPU上比标准GLU快34%，内存效率提升47%，推理速度提升19.7倍，且下游任务精度不降反升。

Conclusion: MGLU在保持或超越GLU性能的同时，显著提升了计算效率和内存利用率，适用于大型语言模型。

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

Conclusion: Sub-MoE在压缩MoE模型方面优于现有方法，具有高效性和性能保持能力。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs face significant obstacles due to their massive
parameter scale, which imposes memory, storage, and deployment challenges.
Although recent expert merging methods promise greater efficiency by
consolidating multiple experts, they are fundamentally hindered by parameter
conflicts arising from expert specialization. In this paper, we present
Sub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key
insight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated
expert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared
$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$
components. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)
Adaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via
K-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)
Subspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to
derive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues
frequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert
reconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse
experts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression
for further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,
and Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms
existing expert pruning and merging methods. Notably, our Sub-MoE maintains
96\%|86\% of original performance with 25\%|50\% expert reduction on
Mixtral-8x7B in zero-shot benchmarks. Code will be released at

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought have emerged as
powerful tools for complex, reasoning-intensive
tasks\citep{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability,
openai2024openaio1card}. However, this paradigm introduces a new user
experience challenge: users have little insight into how much time the model
will spend reasoning before returning an answer. This unpredictability, can
lead to user frustration and is likely to compound as LLMs can produce
increasingly long tasks asynchronously
\citep{kwa2025measuringaiabilitycomplete}. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate methods for both online and offline prediction of model "thinking
time," aiming to develop a practical "progress bar for reasoning." We discuss
the implications for user interaction and future research directions.

Motivation: 当前深度学习算法通过隐式估计后验概率（如最小化Softmax交叉熵损失）在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在长尾数据分布中会导致梯度不平衡，无法确保贝叶斯最优决策规则。

Method: BAPE方法显式建模后验概率参数，通过点估计直接学习贝叶斯分类器，避免了梯度下降，并提出分布调整技术以适应任意不平衡的测试数据分布。

Conclusion: BAPE方法通过显式建模后验概率，解决了长尾数据中的问题，且与现有方法正交，简单有效。

Abstract: Bayesian decision theory advocates the Bayes classifier as the optimal
approach for minimizing the risk in machine learning problems. Current deep
learning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by
\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \emph{e.g.}, by
minimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been
proven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.
However, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real
world, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the
Bayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a
novel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of
the data distributions by \emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the
posterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,
our method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based
on Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and
ensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a
straightforward yet effective \emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This
method enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set
to effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance
factor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional
computational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are
orthogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they
are mostly designed under the principle of \emph{implicitly} estimating the
posterior probabilities. Extensive empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10-LT,
CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the generalization performance of popular deep networks,
despite its simplicity.

TL;DR: 论文认为当前深度学习研究中许多反直觉现象的研究缺乏实际应用证据，建议将其作为验证通用理论的工具而非孤立问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习研究中反直觉现象的研究价值，避免低效的孤立解释。

Method: 分析文献中的典型案例，提出研究建议。

Result: 指出这些现象在现实应用中证据不足，但可作为验证通用理论的工具。

Conclusion: 建议调整研究方向，确保与深度学习整体目标一致。

Abstract: Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena
has constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent
years. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket
hypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc
hypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,
case-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,
there is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world
applications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the
broader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles
that require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we
suggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing
unique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more
general deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the
research outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the
recent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in
approaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future
research, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well
aligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of
deep learning.

Conclusion: HDTree为层次谱系分析提供了新工具，提升了细胞分化路径建模的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In single-cell research, tracing and analyzing high-throughput single-cell
differentiation trajectories is crucial for understanding complex biological
processes. Key to this is the modeling and generation of hierarchical data that
represents the intrinsic structure within datasets. Traditional methods face
limitations in terms of computational cost, performance, generative capacity,
and stability. Recent VAEs based approaches have made strides in addressing
these challenges but still require specialized network modules for each tree
branch, limiting their stability and ability to capture deep hierarchical
relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce diffusion-based
approach called HDTree. HDTree captures tree relationships within a
hierarchical latent space using a unified hierarchical codebook and quantized
diffusion processes to model tree node transitions. This method improves
stability by eliminating branch-specific modules and enhancing generative
capacity through gradual hierarchical changes simulated by the diffusion
process. HDTree's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons on both
general-purpose and single-cell datasets, where it outperforms existing methods
in terms of accuracy and performance. These contributions provide a new tool
for hierarchical lineage analysis, enabling more accurate and efficient
modeling of cellular differentiation paths and offering insights for downstream
biological tasks. The code of HDTree is available at anonymous link

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific
discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and
domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug
discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce
chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a
systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven
molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical
structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering,
automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure
reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond
the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for
scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability
improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate
promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted
improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We
provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation
architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for
applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is
essential.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据估值方法的偏见和不稳定性，提出了Data Valuation Cards（DValCards）框架以提高透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据为中心的机器学习（ML）的普及，数据估值方法被用于量化数据点对模型性能的贡献，但其偏见和不稳定性可能导致技术和伦理问题。

Method: 通过分析9个表格分类数据集和6种数据估值方法，研究了数据预处理、子采样和估值偏差的影响。

Result: 研究发现数据估值方法易受预处理技术影响，可能加剧类别不平衡，并低估少数群体数据的价值。

Conclusion: 提出DValCards框架以提高数据估值的透明度，减少误用并促进可信的ML系统。

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML),
various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution
of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data
cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the
context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly
compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are
inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices,
resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular
classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1)
common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter
estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase
class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented
group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency
associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data
Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of
DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data
pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

Abstract: We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training
generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to
electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as
tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding
temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution
trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model
weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a
large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling
zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS
on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing
that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to
those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability
across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation
tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early
warning detection, and synthetic trial design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BiDD的新方法，用于解决在存在未观测中介变量时的双变量因果发现问题，通过引入一种新的独立性测试统计量，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的加性噪声模型（ANM）在存在未观测中介变量时失效，而现有解决方案在有限样本下表现不稳定，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出Bivariate Denoising Diffusion（BiDD），通过去噪过程中的独立性测试统计量来推断因果方向，而非传统的均方误差比较。

Result: 实验表明，BiDD在存在中介变量干扰时表现优于现有方法，同时在无中介变量时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: BiDD是一种高效且鲁棒的双变量因果发现方法，特别适用于存在未观测中介变量的场景。

Abstract: Distinguishing cause and effect from bivariate observational data is a
foundational problem in many disciplines, but challenging without additional
assumptions. Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable
sample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based
methods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between
variables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously
characterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of
unmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden
mediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical
utility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)
for causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by
unmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through
mean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel
independence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for
each variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the
independence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic
consistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under
hidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate
consistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted
settings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.

Result: 在DABStep基准测试中，该框架显著提高了多步推理任务的精度和覆盖率。

Conclusion: 结合逻辑推理模块的LLMs能提升系统可靠性和可解释性，为复杂领域的可信AI提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of
artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic
orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic
inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical
reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper
investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that
augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging
Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and
explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries
into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common
failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We
demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through
experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and
system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that
combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor,
enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy,
interpretable AI agents across complex domains.

Motivation: 由于计算科学中基准数据集的稀缺性，评估新方法变得困难，因此开发了BenchMake工具以解决这一问题。

Method: 使用非负矩阵分解确定性地识别和隔离边缘案例，并优化测试集划分以最大化差异和统计显著性。

Result: 在十个公开可用的基准数据集上，BenchMake的划分优于现有划分和随机划分。

Conclusion: BenchMake能够有效地将科学数据集转化为基准测试集，为计算科学领域提供了一种新的评估工具。

Abstract: Benchmark data sets are a cornerstone of machine learning development and
applications, ensuring new methods are robust, reliable and competitive. The
relative rarity of benchmark sets in computational science, due to the
uniqueness of the problems and the pace of change in the associated domains,
makes evaluating new innovations difficult for computational scientists. In
this paper a new tool is developed and tested to potentially turn any of the
increasing numbers of scientific data sets made openly available into a
benchmark accessible to the community. BenchMake uses non-negative matrix
factorisation to deterministically identify and isolate challenging edge cases
on the convex hull (the smallest convex set that contains all existing data
instances) and partitions a required fraction of matched data instances into a
testing set that maximises divergence and statistical significance, across
tabular, graph, image, signal and textual modalities. BenchMake splits are
compared to establish splits and random splits using ten publicly available
benchmark sets from different areas of science, with different sizes, shapes,
distributions.

TL;DR: PETSA是一种参数高效的方法，通过在测试时仅更新输入和输出的小型校准模块，适应非平稳时间序列，减少内存和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列通常具有非平稳性，这会降低预训练预测模型的性能。现有的测试时适应方法通常更新整个模型，增加了内存和计算成本。

Method: PETSA使用低秩适配器和动态门控调整表示，无需重新训练。通过结合鲁棒项、频域项和块结构项的特殊损失函数，保持准确性。

Result: PETSA在基准数据集上表现出色，性能优于或与基线相当，同时需要更少的参数。

Conclusion: PETSA通过参数高效的方式提升了预测模型的适应性，适用于各种时间序列预测任务。

Abstract: Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the
performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods
typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We
propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test
time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA
uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without
retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we
introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)
a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise
structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of
various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive
or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户行为序列的Transformer方法，用于检测内部威胁，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将用户活动视为孤立事件，未能利用行为序列的依赖性。

Method: 使用Transformer Encoder建模用户行为序列，结合三种无监督异常检测算法。

Result: 在多个测试集上表现优异，准确率96.61%，召回率99.43%。

Conclusion: 序列建模和先进异常检测在内部威胁领域效果显著。

Abstract: Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized
status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing
machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby
failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we
propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT
insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep
sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model
benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores.
These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier
detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and
Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets,
including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer
pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61%
accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low
false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and
conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential
user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.

Conclusion: TripleAD通过多通道设计和互蒸馏策略，有效提升了图异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and
economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses.
Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of
detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the
tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in
suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual
distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It
includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and
mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of
anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation
module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing
issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced
structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information
flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an
attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and
structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual
distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and
collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.

Motivation: 现代神经网络在预测准确性上有所提升，但普遍存在过度自信的问题，尤其在安全关键场景中风险显著。现有校准方法面临全局调整偏差大或局部调整方差高的困境。

Method: SMART利用logit间隙（top两个logit的差值）作为去噪信号，结合SoftECE目标函数，通过自适应分箱平衡偏差和方差。

Result: SMART在多种数据集和架构上表现优异，即使参数更少，也能实现最先进的校准性能。

Conclusion: SMART为神经网络预测中的不确定性量化提供了一个高效、稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

Result: 实验表明FedWSQ在极端数据异构和低比特通信场景下优于现有方法，显著减少通信开销并保持高精度。

Conclusion: FedWSQ为联邦学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

Motivation: 动量方法在深度神经网络等随机非凸优化中的理论依据不足，QHM作为广义动量算法被提出以填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了小批量QHM在批量大小增加时的收敛性，分析了学习率衰减和批量增加对收敛的影响。

Result: 实验表明，增加批量大小而不衰减学习率的策略在训练神经网络时更有效。

Conclusion: QHM在随机非凸优化中具有潜力，增加批量大小是一种可行的优化策略。

Abstract: Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex
objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep
neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization
-- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings
remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that
generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand
the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide
both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with
an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence
requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a
decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we
demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without
decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments
show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for
training neural networks.

Abstract: We investigate the universal approximation property (UAP) of transformer-type
architectures, providing a unified theoretical framework that extends prior
results on residual networks to models incorporating attention mechanisms. Our
work identifies token distinguishability as a fundamental requirement for UAP
and introduces a general sufficient condition that applies to a broad class of
architectures. Leveraging an analyticity assumption on the attention layer, we
can significantly simplify the verification of this condition, providing a
non-constructive approach in establishing UAP for such architectures. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework by proving UAP for transformers
with various attention mechanisms, including kernel-based and sparse attention
mechanisms. The corollaries of our results either generalize prior works or
establish UAP for architectures not previously covered. Furthermore, our
framework offers a principled foundation for designing novel transformer
architectures with inherent UAP guarantees, including those with specific
functional symmetries. We propose examples to illustrate these insights.

*Neta Shaul,Uriel Singer,Itai Gat,Yaron Lipman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Transition Matching（TM）的新生成范式，统一了扩散/流模型和连续自回归生成，通过分解复杂任务为简单马尔可夫转移，提供了更灵活的设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型的改进空间有限，而连续自回归模型在统一文本和媒体生成方面表现出潜力。本文旨在通过TM范式推动这两类模型的统一与进步。

Method: TM将生成任务分解为马尔可夫转移，支持非确定性概率转移核和任意非连续监督过程。提出了三种TM变体：DTM（推广流匹配）、ARTM和FHTM（推广连续自回归方法）。

Result: DTM在图像质量和文本一致性上达到SOTA，采样效率提升；ARTM和FHTM在连续因果自回归生成质量上与非因果方法相当，FHTM首次在文本到图像任务中超越流方法。

Conclusion: TM范式为生成任务提供了更灵活的设计空间，其变体在多个任务中表现出色，尤其是FHTM在因果模型中首次超越非因果方法。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have significantly advanced media
generation, yet their design space is well-explored, somewhat limiting further
improvements. Concurrently, autoregressive (AR) models, particularly those
generating continuous tokens, have emerged as a promising direction for
unifying text and media generation. This paper introduces Transition Matching
(TM), a novel discrete-time, continuous-state generative paradigm that unifies
and advances both diffusion/flow models and continuous AR generation. TM
decomposes complex generation tasks into simpler Markov transitions, allowing
for expressive non-deterministic probability transition kernels and arbitrary
non-continuous supervision processes, thereby unlocking new flexible design
avenues. We explore these choices through three TM variants: (i) Difference
Transition Matching (DTM), which generalizes flow matching to discrete-time by
directly learning transition probabilities, yielding state-of-the-art image
quality and text adherence as well as improved sampling efficiency. (ii)
Autoregressive Transition Matching (ARTM) and (iii) Full History Transition
Matching (FHTM) are partially and fully causal models, respectively, that
generalize continuous AR methods. They achieve continuous causal AR generation
quality comparable to non-causal approaches and potentially enable seamless
integration with existing AR text generation techniques. Notably, FHTM is the
first fully causal model to match or surpass the performance of flow-based
methods on text-to-image task in continuous domains. We demonstrate these
contributions through a rigorous large-scale comparison of TM variants and
relevant baselines, maintaining a fixed architecture, training data, and
hyperparameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为A2P的新框架，用于预测未来异常事件的时间点，解决了现有方法在异常预测（AP）任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来异常事件的时间点（AP）是一个重要但未被充分探索的领域，现有方法无法提供精确的未来异常预测。

Method: A2P框架由异常感知预测（AAF）和合成异常提示（SAP）组成，通过学习和模拟异常关系来预测未来异常。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，A2P优于现有方法，能够有效预测未来异常。

Conclusion: A2P框架为解决未来异常预测问题提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important
scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting
specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly
Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time
series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to
provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we
propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of
Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To
enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a
strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of
anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP)
that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to
predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非线性低秩表示（NLR）和卷积神经网络（CNN）的水质数据缺失填补方法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质数据因传感器故障和通信延迟等问题常出现高维稀疏缺失，传统方法难以捕捉潜在动态和深层特征。

Method: 结合CNN，融合时间特征以建模时间依赖性，并提取非线性交互和局部模式以实现多维信息的深度融合。

Result: 在三个真实水质数据集上的实验表明，该方法在估计精度上显著优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 为复杂动态环境中的水质监测数据处理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The integrity of Water Quality Data (WQD) is critical in environmental
monitoring for scientific decision-making and ecological protection. However,
water quality monitoring systems are often challenged by large amounts of
missing data due to unavoidable problems such as sensor failures and
communication delays, which further lead to water quality data becoming
High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS). Traditional data imputation methods are
difficult to depict the potential dynamics and fail to capture the deep data
features, resulting in unsatisfactory imputation performance. To effectively
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Low-rank
Representation model (NLR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
imputing missing WQD, which utilizes CNNs to implement two ideas: a) fusing
temporal features to model the temporal dependence of data between time slots,
and b) Extracting nonlinear interactions and local patterns to mine
higher-order relationships features and achieve deep fusion of multidimensional
information. Experimental studies on three real water quality datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art data imputation models in terms of estimation accuracy. It
provides an effective approach for handling water quality monitoring data in
complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Transformer通过专用计算电路学习模算术，为更高效和可解释的神经方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modular exponentiation is crucial to number theory and cryptography, yet
remains largely unexplored from a mechanistic interpretability standpoint. We
train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and
investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing
principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation
patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the
model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance
gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized
accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model
internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting
entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full
performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that
transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational
circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches
to modular exponentiation.

Conclusion: SDBs为实际应用提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy
measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based
generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this
task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt
pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods
that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data.
While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the
latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System
embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge
methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the
coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields
consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates
robust generalization under system misspecification between training and
deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.

Conclusion: 提出的方法填补了图像自回归模型放射性水印的空白，为生成图像的版权保护提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying message-passing framework for training
spiking neural networks (SNNs) using Expectation-Propagation. Our gradient-free
method is capable of learning the marginal distributions of network parameters
and simultaneously marginalizes nuisance parameters, such as the outputs of
hidden layers. This framework allows for the first time, training of discrete
and continuous weights, for deterministic and stochastic spiking networks,
using batches of training samples. Although its convergence is not ensured, the
algorithm converges in practice faster than gradient-based methods, without
requiring a large number of passes through the training data. The
classification and regression results presented pave the way for new efficient
training methods for deep Bayesian networks.

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，可扩展性强，能生成更具控制流模式的聚类。

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms automatically extract process models from event
logs, but high variability often results in complex and hard-to-understand
models. To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process
executions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable
process model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning
traces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process
models. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process
model discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or
probability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to
capture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace
clustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.
Our approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on
directly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment. This allows
clustering decisions to consider both structural alignment with a cluster's
process model and the likelihood that a trace originates from a given
stochastic process model. The method is computationally efficient, scales
linearly with input size, and improves model interpretability by producing
clusters with clearer control-flow patterns. Extensive experiments on public
real-life datasets show that our method outperforms existing alternatives in
representing process behavior and reveals how clustering performance rankings
can shift when stochasticity is considered.

TL;DR: WATS提出了一种基于图小波的节点特定温度缩放方法，用于改进GNN的置信度校准，无需重新训练模型或访问邻居信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的置信度估计与实际预测准确性不一致，限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用。现有方法依赖粗粒度统计或潜在嵌入，忽略了图拓扑的细粒度结构异质性。

Method: WATS利用可调热核图小波特征为每个节点分配特定温度，通过图小波的可扩展性和拓扑敏感性优化置信度估计。

Result: 在七个基准数据集和两种GNN架构上，WATS的预期校准误差（ECE）最低，比现有方法最高提升42.3%，校准方差平均降低17.24%。

Conclusion: WATS是一种高效的后处理校准框架，适用于不同规模和密度的图，显著提升了GNN的置信度校准性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance
on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with
actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in
safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek
to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop
statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,
thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph
topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a
post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on
tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the
scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence
estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring
logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets
with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS
achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared
methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to
42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared
with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,
scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be
released based on publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法存在偏差、计算成本高或近似不准确的问题，需要一种更高效、准确的解决方案。

Result: KAIROS在噪声、错误标注和污染基准测试中表现优于现有方法，速度提升50倍。

Conclusion: KAIROS提供了一种高效、准确的数据估值方法，具有理论保证和实际应用优势。

Abstract: Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory
compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods
remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and
inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley
require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based
model-agnostic methods rely on approximations that misrank examples relative to
their true leave-one-out (LOO) utility. We introduce KAIROS, a scalable,
model-agnostic valuation framework that assigns each example a distributional
influence score: its contribution to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between
the empirical training distribution and a clean reference set. Unlike
Wasserstein surrogates, our MMD-based influence admits a closed-form solution
that faithfully approximates the exact LOO ranking within $O(1/N^2)$ error,
requires no retraining, and naturally extends to conditional kernels for
unified label- and feature-error detection. Moreover, KAIROS supports efficient
online updates: when a new batch of size m arrives, all scores can be updated
in $O(mN)$ time, delivering up to 50x speedup without compromising ranking
quality. Empirical evaluations on noise, mislabeling, and poisoning benchmarks
show that KAIROS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art model-, Shapley-,
and Wasserstein-based baselines in both accuracy and runtime. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees, including symmetry for reproducible rankings
and density-separation for interpretable thresholds.

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解松弛阶段对训练深层预测编码网络的重要性，为复杂任务中的应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural
models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process.
Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow
architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds
five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this
degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during
weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in
guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two
novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to
re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation
phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that
reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods
on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large
improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with
performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings
suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to
train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities
for their application in complex tasks.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a novel adaptive anomaly detection framework
specifically designed for monitoring sequential random finite set (RFS)
observations. Our approach effectively distinguishes between In-Control data
(normal) and Out-Of-Control data (anomalies) by detecting deviations from the
expected statistical behavior of the process. The primary contributions of this
study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not
only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also
dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point
patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior
distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate
adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of
point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by extensive qualitative
and quantitative simulation experiments.

Conclusion: 首次理论证明了AdaGrad型算法可以同时受益于对角预处理和动量，解释了Adam的实际高效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad-type
preconditioning. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a unified
convergence analysis of SGD with adaptive preconditioning under anisotropic or
matrix smoothness and noise assumptions. This allows us to recover
state-of-the-art convergence results for several popular adaptive gradient
methods, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad, and ASGO/One-sided Shampoo. In
addition, we establish the fundamental connection between two recently proposed
algorithms, Scion and DASGO, and provide the first theoretical guarantees for
the latter. Second, we show that the convergence of methods like AdaGrad and
DASGO can be provably accelerated beyond the best-known rates using Nesterov
momentum. Consequently, we obtain the first theoretical justification that
AdaGrad-type algorithms can simultaneously benefit from both diagonal
preconditioning and momentum, which may provide an ultimate explanation for the
practical efficiency of Adam.

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

formation recognition and player position assignment in football using
predefined static formation templates and cost minimization from spatiotemporal

optimally match players to positions within a set of template formations by
minimizing the total distance between actual player locations and template
positions, subsequently selecting the formation with the lowest assignment
cost. To improve accuracy, we scale actual player positions to match the
dimensions of these formation templates in both width and length. While the
method functions effectively on individual frames, it extends naturally to
larger game segments such as complete periods, possession sequences or specific
intervals (e.g. 10 second intervals, 5 minute intervals etc.). Additionally, we
incorporate an optional stability parameter that prevents unnecessary formation
changes when assignment costs differ only marginally between time segments.
EFPI is available as open-source code through the unravelsports Python package.

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在已知概念上效果有限，但在发现未知概念方面表现强大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于SAEs实用性的争议，明确其适用场景。

Method: 提出概念区分，将SAEs分为已知概念和未知概念的应用。

Result: SAEs在ML可解释性、社会科学和健康科学等领域有潜在应用。

Conclusion: SAEs的价值在于发现未知概念，而非已知概念的操作。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a
series of negative results have added to skepticism about their usefulness.
Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

Conclusion: 该生物混合系统为可持续环境监测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Living plants, while contributing to ecological balance and climate
regulation, also function as natural sensors capable of transmitting
information about their internal physiological states and surrounding
conditions. This rich source of data provides potential for applications in
environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. With integration into
biohybrid systems, we establish novel channels of physiological signal flow
between living plants and artificial devices. We equipped *Hedera helix* with a
plant-wearable device called PhytoNode to continuously record the plant's
electrophysiological activity. We deployed plants in an uncontrolled outdoor
environment to map electrophysiological patterns to environmental conditions.
Over five months, we collected data that we analyzed using state-of-the-art and
automated machine learning (AutoML). Our classification models achieve high
performance, reaching macro F1 scores of up to 95 percent in binary tasks.
AutoML approaches outperformed manual tuning, and selecting subsets of
statistical features further improved accuracy. Our biohybrid living system
monitors the electrophysiology of plants in harsh, real-world conditions. This
work advances scalable, self-sustaining, and plant-integrated living biohybrid
systems for sustainable environmental monitoring.

Method: 训练Transformer于不同顺序的目标序列混合数据，通过早期损失下降识别良性顺序，采用两阶段分层方法进行块间和块内重排序。

Result: 在四个顺序敏感的算术任务中，方法成功从数十亿候选顺序中识别出学习友好顺序，并在乘法任务中重现了先前研究中的反向数字顺序。

Conclusion: 优化输入令牌顺序可显著提升Transformer学习算术任务的效率，验证了顺序对推理的重要性。

Abstract: The chain of thought is fundamental in Transformers, which is to perform
step-by-step reasoning. Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of
these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study
addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder
input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn
arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture
of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign
orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space
grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical
approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four
order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a
learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the
multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior
studies.

Result: 结果表明，RL方法能有效实现流动前沿的精确收敛，提升工艺控制和产品质量。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在复合材料制造中具有改善工艺控制和产品质量的潜力。

Abstract: Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes
for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites,
particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades.
Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure
the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing
residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural
integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning
(RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising
the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin
inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our
approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially
observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL
approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential
towards improving process control and product quality in composites
manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升医疗文档的可访问性，支持患者和医护人员做出知情决策。

Abstract: Millions of people in African countries face barriers to accessing healthcare
due to language and literacy gaps. This research tackles this challenge by
transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user
manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study
in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for
communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the
accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available
in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local
populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context).
The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our
open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to
other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed
to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for
prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users --
such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical
equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive
accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic
understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and
multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility
to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering
patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.

Motivation: 现有在线修复方法缺乏通用性和适应性，修复效果不佳，ADReFT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合Transformer模型的双头设计（状态监控器和决策适配器），通过监督学习和强化学习训练模型。

Result: ADReFT在修复性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ADReFT通过自适应修复策略有效提升了自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due
to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities.
Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the
runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions
enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into
acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based
constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack
generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in
ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently
but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we
propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method
that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed
tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.
Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint
heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving
environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate
adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety
identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse
annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and
others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to
mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat
conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT
using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate
more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation
results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.

Abstract: The ability to quickly and accurately compute properties from atomic
simulations is critical for advancing a large number of applications in
chemistry and materials science including drug discovery, energy storage, and
semiconductor manufacturing. To address this need, Meta FAIR presents a family
of Universal Models for Atoms (UMA), designed to push the frontier of speed,
accuracy, and generalization. UMA models are trained on half a billion unique
3D atomic structures (the largest training runs to date) by compiling data
across multiple chemical domains, e.g. molecules, materials, and catalysts. We
develop empirical scaling laws to help understand how to increase model
capacity alongside dataset size to achieve the best accuracy. The UMA small and
medium models utilize a novel architectural design we refer to as mixture of
linear experts that enables increasing model capacity without sacrificing
speed. For example, UMA-medium has 1.4B parameters but only ~50M active
parameters per atomic structure. We evaluate UMA models on a diverse set of
applications across multiple domains and find that, remarkably, a single model
without any fine-tuning can perform similarly or better than specialized
models. We are releasing the UMA code, weights, and associated data to
accelerate computational workflows and enable the community to continue to
build increasingly capable AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，神经网络的认证鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法因非凸性和全局半定规划（SDP）的可扩展性问题而受限。

Method: 采用循环变换重新参数化网络，提出凸可容许条件，并通过随机子空间线性矩阵不等式（RS-LMI）分解全局约束为层间约束。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和ImageNet上，该方法实现了竞争性精度，显著提升了Lipschitz边界和运行时性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络的认证鲁棒性提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Certified robustness is a critical property for deploying neural networks
(NN) in safety-critical applications. A principle approach to achieving such
guarantees is to constrain the global Lipschitz constant of the network.
However, accurate methods for Lipschitz-constrained training often suffer from
non-convex formulations and poor scalability due to reliance on global
semidefinite programs (SDPs). In this letter, we propose a convex training
framework that enforces global Lipschitz constraints via semidefinite
relaxation. By reparameterizing the NN using loop transformation, we derive a
convex admissibility condition that enables tractable and certifiable training.
While the resulting formulation guarantees robustness, its scalability is
limited by the size of global SDP. To overcome this, we develop a randomized
subspace linear matrix inequalities (RS-LMI) approach that decomposes the
global constraints into sketched layerwise constraints projected onto
low-dimensional subspaces, yielding a smooth and memory-efficient training
objective. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that
the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy with significantly
improved Lipschitz bounds and runtime performance.

Motivation: 当前应用层由封闭专有平台主导，缺乏互操作性，LLM代理能低成本实现数据交换，打破垄断。

Method: 利用LLM代理自动翻译数据格式并与人类界面交互，实现通用互操作性。

Result: 通用互操作性削弱垄断行为，促进数据可移植性，但也带来安全风险和技术债务。

Conclusion: ML社区应拥抱这一趋势，同时构建框架以减轻负面影响，利用AI恢复用户自由和市场竞争。

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

<details>

Motivation: 当前TTA研究存在结果重复、评估指标有限、实验设置不一致和分析不足等问题，阻碍了公平比较和实际应用。

Method: TTA-VLM在统一框架中实现了8种情景TTA和7种在线TTA方法，并在15个数据集上评估，扩展了模型和训练时调优方法的范围。

Result: 实验发现现有TTA方法提升有限，与训练时调优方法协作不佳，且准确性提升常以降低模型可信度为代价。

Conclusion: TTA-VLM旨在促进更可靠和通用的TTA策略发展，为社区提供公平比较和全面评估工具。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Conclusion: RandomizedQ在理论和实践中均表现出色，解决了现有探索方法的局限性。

Abstract: While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical
performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement
learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free
settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational
intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness
and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant
of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates
sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic
tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where
$S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode
length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a
logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the
optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance
compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and
Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.

Result: 研究发现表达能力强的模型在对称性高的数据中表现显著优于简单模型，但在标准基准测试中可能表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了根据数据集特性选择模型的重要性，并提供了分析未来架构的理论工具。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of
node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical
understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on
graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and
provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link
representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$
framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables
formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy
of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future
architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation
protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess
link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in
practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of
distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on
standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry
increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.

Conclusion: 该方法理论鲁棒，对评分估计误差容忍度高，无需高阶平滑假设，优于先前工作。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore provable acceleration of diffusion models without
any additional retraining. Focusing on the task of approximating a target data
distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation
distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that
requires only the order of
  $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$
  score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate
scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to
a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions
such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact
score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases
-- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed
in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE
solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement
to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.

Conclusion: 通过系统评估混合训练策略，论文为合成数据在神经网络训练中的高效应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to real data for
training artificial neural networks (ANN). However, the disparity between
synthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor
performance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world
scenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which
combine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.
While these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic
evaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and
architectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study
comprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent
architectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we
sample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to
investigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this
paper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in
the training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and
efficacy.

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including
in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties
such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known
to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist
other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can
consistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited
prior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly
distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.
Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads
to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by
$h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training
dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the
approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our
analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including
transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further
provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and
function compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct
comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,
including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by
maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves
comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets. Code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态数值输入难以捕捉高层次语义模式，现有基于文本的方法受限于离散特性，缺乏人类视觉直觉。

Method: 构建视觉和文本模态，通过对比学习对齐，并引入变量选择模块识别关键变量。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于单模态和跨模态基线。

Conclusion: 多模态对齐显著提升了时间序列预测效果。

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种诊断多智能体系统（MAS）中意义层面错位的框架——Misalignment Mosaic，通过分析术语不一致、概念到代码的退化、道德与合作混淆以及解释模糊性，揭示了错位的根源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中的错位常被归因于技术问题，但许多问题源于设计阶段的语言和概念模糊。论文旨在揭示合作与协调混淆等概念性问题如何导致系统错位。

Method: 利用Rabbit-Duck错觉说明视角依赖的行为解读，并提出Misalignment Mosaic框架，包含四个诊断组件。

Result: 框架能够诊断语言、框架和设计假设导致的错位，并适用于其他过载概念（如对齐、自主性和信任）。

Conclusion: 论文强调意义本身可能是错位的根源，提供了一种通用框架来诊断和解决多智能体系统中的概念性问题。

Abstract: Misalignment in multi-agent systems (MAS) is often treated as a technical
failure; yet many such failures originate upstream, during the conceptual
design phase, where semantic ambiguity and normative projection take place.
This paper identifies a foundational source of interpretive misalignment in
MAS: the systemic conflation of cooperation and coordination, and the moral
overreading that follows. Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how
perspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic
instability. To address this, we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic, a
diagnostic framework for diagnosing meaning-level misalignment in MAS. It
comprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2. Concept-to-Code
Decay, 3. Morality as Cooperation, and 4. Interpretive Ambiguity. The Mosaic
enables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy
or reward structures but also through language, framing, and design
assumptions. While this paper focuses on the specific ambiguity between
coordination and cooperation, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded
concepts in MAS, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust. Rather than define
cooperation once and for all, we offer a framework to diagnose meaning itself
as a source of misalignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAG-WM的篡改感知生成图像水印方法，旨在解决AI生成内容（AIGC）的版权和真实性风险。该方法通过四个关键模块实现了高鲁棒性和篡改定位能力，同时保持生成质量无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）的高效视觉创作能力带来了版权和真实性风险，现有水印方法在篡改鲁棒性和定位能力上存在不足，需要改进。

Method: TAG-WM包含四个模块：双标记联合采样（DMJS）、水印潜在重建（WLR）、密集变化区域检测器（DVRD）和篡改感知解码（TAD），通过潜在空间嵌入水印并检测篡改。

Result: 实验表明，TAG-WM在保持无损生成质量和256位容量的同时，实现了最先进的篡改鲁棒性和定位能力。

Conclusion: TAG-WM为AIGC的版权保护和真实性验证提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises
copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity
verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a
potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable
of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.
However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing
applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new
demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks
remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,
necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid
iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making
proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.
To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative
image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key
modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright
and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative
quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a
dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion
sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and
the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The
experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness
and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining
lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在准确性和可扩展性上的局限性，特别是在处理大规模和高度修改图像时的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of modified images on social networks that are driven
by widely accessible editing tools demands robust forensic tools for digital
governance. Image provenance analysis, which filters various query image
variants and constructs a directed graph to trace their phylogeny history, has
emerged as a critical solution. However, existing methods face two fundamental
limitations: First, accuracy issues arise from overlooking heavily modified
images due to low similarity while failing to exclude unrelated images and
determine modification directions under diverse modification scenarios. Second,
scalability bottlenecks stem from pairwise image analysis incurs quadratic
complexity, hindering application in large-scale scenarios. This paper presents
a scalable end-to-end pipeline for image provenance analysis that achieves high
precision with linear complexity. This improves filtering effectiveness through
modification relationship tracing, which enables the comprehensive discovery of
image variants regardless of their visual similarity to the query. In addition,
the proposed pipeline integrates local features matching and compression
artifact capturing, enhancing robustness against diverse modifications and
enabling accurate analysis of images' relationships. This allows the generation
of a directed provenance graph that accurately characterizes the image's
phylogeny history. Furthermore, by optimizing similarity calculations and
eliminating redundant pairwise analysis during graph construction, the pipeline
achieves a linear time complexity, ensuring its scalability for large-scale
scenarios. Experiments demonstrate pipeline's superior performance, achieving a
16.7-56.1% accuracy improvement. Notably, it exhibits significant scalability
with an average 3.0-second response time on 10 million scale images, which is
far shorter than the SOTA approach's 12-minute duration.

Motivation: 研究机器人在公共环境中的实际应用效果，了解用户对机器人的接受度和改进需求。

Method: 在博物馆设置自主对话机器人，通过结构化访谈和系统日志分析收集数据。

Result: 性别线索无显著影响，多数人希望机器人提供展品信息，改进需求为多语言支持和更快响应。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进机器人系统提供了实用建议，以提升其在现实场景中的应用价值。

Abstract: The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six
consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No
specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding
possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the
44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their
reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use.
The android's voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to
give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact
on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot
to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other
roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by
different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster
response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the
interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed,
that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests
asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different
language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are
now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application.

Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of
high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn
or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed
sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic
functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic
agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual
information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between
proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor
relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor
modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic
interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed
the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding
temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion
primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its
sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method
can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement
trajectories or brain signals.

Result: 在DRAMA数据集上评估，BLEU、ROUGE、CIDEr和SPICE分数显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 针对性注意力机制可提升实时自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何设计实现低信息刺激下的复杂变形，为自适应设计和制造提供了通用平台。

Abstract: We present a simple, accessible method for autonomously transforming flat
plastic sheets into intricate three-dimensional structures using only uniform
heating and common tools such as household ovens and scissors. Our approach
combines heat-shrinkable thermoplastics with Kirigami patterns tailored to the
target 3D shape, creating bilayer composites that morph into a wide range of
complex structures, e.g., bowls, pyramids, and even custom ergonomic surfaces
like mouse covers. Critically, the transformation is driven by a
low-information stimulus (uniform heat) yet produces highly intricate shapes
through programmed geometric design. The morphing behavior, confirmed by finite
element simulations, arises from strain mismatch between the contracting
thermoplastic layer and the constraining Kirigami layer. By decoupling material
composition from mechanical response, this method avoids detailed process
control and enables a broad class of self-morphing structures, offering a
versatile platform for adaptive design and scalable manufacturing.

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage

Abstract: Robust and adaptive robotic peg-in-hole assembly under tight tolerances is
critical to various industrial applications. However, it remains an open
challenge due to perceptual and physical uncertainties from contact-rich
interactions that easily exceed the allowed clearance. In this paper, we study
how to leverage contact between the peg and its matching hole to eliminate
uncertainties in the assembly process under unstructured settings. By examining
the role of compliance under contact constraints, we present a manipulation
system that plans collision-inclusive interactions for the peg to 1)
iteratively identify its task environment to localize the target hole and 2)
exploit environmental contact constraints to refine insertion motions into the
target hole without relying on precise perception, enabling a robust solution
to peg-in-hole assembly. By conceptualizing the above process as the
composition of funneling in different state spaces, we present a formal
approach to constructing manipulation funnels as an uncertainty-absorbing
paradigm for peg-in-hole assembly. The proposed system effectively generalizes
across diverse peg-in-hole scenarios across varying scales, shapes, and
materials in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiments on a NIST Assembly
Task Board (ATB) and additional challenging scenarios validate its robustness
in real-world applications.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a significant challenge for robots due to the complex
dynamics and potential self-occlusion of garments. Most existing methods of
efficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of
flattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like
folding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to
garment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified
framework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic
fling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for
precise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding
involves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's
shape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot
learning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization,
which incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and
intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial
action mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by
selecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent
better coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09
percent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that
standardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see

Conclusion: SPI-BoTER方法结合物理可解释性和数据适应性，为工业机器人高精度控制提供了有效解决方案，有望推动智能制造中精密任务的可靠执行。

Abstract: The widespread application of industrial robots in fields such as cutting and
welding has imposed increasingly stringent requirements on the trajectory
accuracy of end-effectors. However, current error compensation methods face
several critical challenges, including overly simplified mechanism modeling, a
lack of physical consistency in data-driven approaches, and substantial data
requirements. These issues make it difficult to achieve both high accuracy and
strong generalization simultaneously. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a Spatial-Physical Informed Attention Residual Network (SPI-BoTER).
This method integrates the kinematic equations of the robotic manipulator with
a Transformer architecture enhanced by sparse self-attention masks. A
parameter-adaptive hybrid loss function incorporating spatial and physical
information is employed to iteratively optimize the network during training,
enabling high-precision error compensation under small-sample conditions.
Additionally, inverse joint angle compensation is performed using a gradient
descent-based optimization method. Experimental results on a small-sample
dataset from a UR5 robotic arm (724 samples, with a train:test:validation split
of 8:1:1) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. It
achieves a 3D absolute positioning error of 0.2515 mm with a standard deviation
of 0.15 mm, representing a 35.16\% reduction in error compared to conventional
deep neural network (DNN) methods. Furthermore, the inverse angle compensation
algorithm converges to an accuracy of 0.01 mm within an average of 147
iterations. This study presents a solution that combines physical
interpretability with data adaptability for high-precision control of
industrial robots, offering promising potential for the reliable execution of
precision tasks in intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to reliably execute complex multi-step manipulation
tasks is crucial for their effective deployment in industrial and household
environments. This paper presents a hierarchical planning and control framework
designed to achieve reliable multi-step humanoid manipulation. The proposed
system comprises three layers: (1) a low-level RL-based controller responsible
for tracking whole-body motion targets; (2) a mid-level set of skill policies
trained via imitation learning that produce motion targets for different steps
of a task; and (3) a high-level vision-language planning module that determines
which skills should be executed and also monitors their completion in real-time
using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Experimental validation is
performed on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot executing a non-prehensile
pick-and-place task. Over 40 real-world trials, the hierarchical system
achieved a 72.5% success rate in completing the full manipulation sequence.
These experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical system,
highlighting the benefits of VLM-based skill planning and monitoring for
multi-step manipulation scenarios. See https://vlp-humanoid.github.io/ for

Abstract: Autonomous drifting is a complex and crucial maneuver for safety-critical
scenarios like slippery roads and emergency collision avoidance, requiring
precise motion planning and control. Traditional motion planning methods often
struggle with the high instability and unpredictability of drifting,
particularly when operating at high speeds. Recent learning-based approaches
have attempted to tackle this issue but often rely on expert knowledge or have
limited exploration capabilities. Additionally, they do not effectively address
safety concerns during learning and deployment. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based motion planner for
autonomous drifting. Our approach integrates an RL agent with model-based drift
dynamics to determine desired drift motion states, while incorporating a
Predictive Safety Filter (PSF) that adjusts the agent's actions online to
prevent unsafe states. This ensures safe and efficient learning, and stable
drift operation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through
simulations on a Matlab-Carsim platform, demonstrating significant improvements
in drift performance, reduced tracking errors, and computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods. This strategy promises to extend the
capabilities of autonomous vehicles in safety-critical maneuvers.

Abstract: The problem of multi-robot coverage control becomes significantly challenging
when multiple robots leave the mission space simultaneously to charge their
batteries, disrupting the underlying network topology for communication and
sensing. To address this, we propose a resilient network design and control
approach that allows robots to achieve the desired coverage performance while
satisfying energy constraints and maintaining network connectivity throughout
the mission. We model the combined motion, energy, and network dynamics of the
multirobot systems (MRS) as a hybrid system with three modes, i.e., coverage,
return-to-base, and recharge, respectively. We show that ensuring the energy
constraints can be transformed into designing appropriate guard conditions for
mode transition between each of the three modes. Additionally, we present a
systematic procedure to design, maintain, and reconfigure the underlying
network topology using an energy-aware bearing rigid network design, enhancing
the structural resilience of the MRS even when a subset of robots departs to
charge their batteries. Finally, we validate our proposed method using
numerical simulations.

Abstract: Exploring high-latitude lunar regions presents an extremely challenging
visual environment for robots. The low sunlight elevation angle and minimal
light scattering result in a visual field dominated by a high dynamic range
featuring long, dynamic shadows. Reproducing these conditions on Earth requires
sophisticated simulators and specialized facilities. We introduce a unique
dataset recorded at the LunaLab from the SnT - University of Luxembourg, an
indoor test facility designed to replicate the optical characteristics of
multiple lunar latitudes. Our dataset includes images, inertial measurements,
and wheel odometry data from robots navigating seven distinct trajectories
under multiple illumination scenarios, simulating high-latitude lunar
conditions from dawn to night time with and without the aid of headlights,
resulting in 88 distinct sequences containing a total of 1.3M images. Data was
captured using a stereo RGB-inertial sensor, a monocular monochrome camera, and
for the first time, a novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. We
recorded both static and dynamic image sequences, with robots navigating at
slow (5 cm/s) and fast (50 cm/s) speeds. All data is calibrated, synchronized,
and timestamped, providing a valuable resource for validating perception tasks
from vision-based autonomous navigation to scientific imaging for future lunar
missions targeting high-latitude regions or those intended for robots operating
across perceptually degraded environments. The dataset can be downloaded from

Conclusion: MGPRL是一种高效、无需校准的分布式定位解决方案。

Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems
operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot
relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like
cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high
computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint
environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel
distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull
of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ
co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware
multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based
alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI
field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are
utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative
localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations
with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with
limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi
RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or
offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed
MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,
comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase
that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and
computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package

Result: 实验表明，SAD-RL训练的智能体能在简单和挑战性场景中高效实现安全行为。

Conclusion: 分层策略和场景多样性是提升自动驾驶决策算法性能的关键。

Abstract: Developing decision-making algorithms for highly automated driving systems
remains challenging, since these systems have to operate safely in an open and
complex environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can learn
comprehensive decision policies directly from experience and already show
promising results in simple driving tasks. However, current approaches fail to
achieve generalizability for more complex driving tasks and lack learning
efficiency. Therefore, we present Scenario-based Automated Driving
Reinforcement Learning (SAD-RL), the first framework that integrates
Reinforcement Learning (RL) of hierarchical policy in a scenario-based
environment. A high-level policy selects maneuver templates that are evaluated
and executed by a low-level control logic. The scenario-based environment
allows to control the training experience for the agent and to explicitly
introduce challenging, but rate situations into the training process. Our
experiments show that an agent trained using the SAD-RL framework can achieve
safe behaviour in easy as well as challenging situations efficiently. Our
ablation studies confirmed that both HRL and scenario diversity are essential
for achieving these results.

Abstract: The event camera, renowned for its high dynamic range and exceptional
temporal resolution, is recognized as an important sensor for visual odometry.
However, the inherent noise in event streams complicates the selection of
high-quality map points, which critically determine the precision of state
estimation. To address this challenge, we propose Voxel-ESVIO, an event-based
stereo visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes voxel map management,
which efficiently filter out high-quality 3D points. Specifically, our
methodology utilizes voxel-based point selection and voxel-aware point
management to collectively optimize the selection and updating of map points on
a per-voxel basis. These synergistic strategies enable the efficient retrieval
of noise-resilient map points with the highest observation likelihood in
current frames, thereby ensureing the state estimation accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our Voxel-ESVIO
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

reduction of approximately 8 dBA during movement, thereby enhancing the
suitability of quadruped robots for deployment in noise-sensitive indoor
environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach across various indoor settings, highlighting the potential of
quadruped robots for quiet operation in noise-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Learning policies for complex humanoid tasks remains both challenging and
compelling. Inspired by how infants and athletes rely on external support--such
as parental walkers or coach-applied guidance--to acquire skills like walking,
dancing, and performing acrobatic flips, we propose A2CF: Adaptive Assistive
Curriculum Force for humanoid motion learning. A2CF trains a dual-agent system,
in which a dedicated assistive force agent applies state-dependent forces to
guide the robot through difficult initial motions and gradually reduces
assistance as the robot's proficiency improves. Across three
benchmarks--bipedal walking, choreographed dancing, and backflip--A2CF achieves
convergence 30% faster than baseline methods, lowers failure rates by over 40%,
and ultimately produces robust, support-free policies. Real-world experiments
further demonstrate that adaptively applied assistive forces significantly
accelerate the acquisition of complex skills in high-dimensional robotic
control.

Abstract: 3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising
approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying
physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However,
existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics
using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require
time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for
training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point
cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss,
supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material,
multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained
multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials,
trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate
scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene
forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics
learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction
scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world
experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving
superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream
visuomotor tasks. Experimental videos are available at

Abstract: Collision-free optimal formation control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
teams is challenging. The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often
rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an
innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple
UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the
need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem
to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This formation
trajectory planning optimal control problem involves a collective performance
index to meet the formation requirements of achieving relative positions and
velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle.
Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure
collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking
problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that
prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns
lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach and
disregards UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The simulation results
for a four-UAV team (re)formation problem confirm the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Abstract: Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet
challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic
environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive
grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic
dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality,
real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus
on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which
differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a
substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a
comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a
dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive
objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed
annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions,
we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to
align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for
intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution,
DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art
approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods,
providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will
drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a

Result: 发现模式崩溃确实存在，预测准确性在接近交互事件时提高，但仍有模型无法预测正确交互模式的情况。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that
account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human
behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most
likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing
methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often
overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally,
traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and
do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none
of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we
propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint
trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce
metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the
sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory
prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When
looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves
closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable
to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode
becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new
insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction
models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: InfGen是一个高保真度的自动驾驶模拟环境，支持无限场景生成。

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

stacked balloon actuator system using exponential, polynomial, and neural
network models with or without autoregressive inputs. The results demonstrate
that simpler models, particularly multivariate polynomials, effectively predict
pressure dynamics with fewer parameters. This research offers a practical
solution for real-time soft robotics applications, balancing model complexity
and computational efficiency. Moreover, the approach may benefit various
techniques that require explicit analytical models.

Abstract: We implement and evaluate different methods for the reconfiguration of a
connected arrangement of tiles into a desired target shape, using a single
active robot that can move along the tile structure. This robot can pick up,
carry, or drop off one tile at a time, but it must maintain a single connected
configuration at all times.
  Becker et al. (CCCG 2025) recently proposed an algorithm that uses histograms
as canonical intermediate configurations, guaranteeing performance within a
constant factor of the optimal solution if the start and target configuration
are well-separated. We implement and evaluate this algorithm, both in a
simulated and practical setting, using an inchworm type robot to compare it
with two existing heuristic algorithms.

Abstract: While we have made significant algorithmic developments to enable autonomous
systems to perform sophisticated tasks, it remains difficult for them to
perform tasks effective and safely. Most existing approaches either fail to
provide any safety assurances or substantially compromise task performance for
safety. In this work, we develop a framework, based on model predictive control
(MPC) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to optimize task performance for
autonomous systems while respecting the safety constraints. Our framework
guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to
high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa
manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves
the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.

Abstract: Efficient identification of picking points is critical for automated fruit
harvesting. Avocados present unique challenges owing to their irregular shape,
weight, and less-structured growing environments, which require specific
viewpoints for successful harvesting. We propose a geometry-based,
semantics-aware viewpoint-planning algorithm to address these challenges. The
planning process involves three key steps: viewpoint sampling, evaluation, and
execution. Starting from a partially occluded view, the system first detects
the fruit, then leverages geometric information to constrain the viewpoint
search space to a 1D circle, and uniformly samples four points to balance the
efficiency and exploration. A new picking score metric is introduced to
evaluate the viewpoint suitability and guide the camera to the next-best view.
We validate our method through simulation against two state-of-the-art
algorithms. Results show a 100% success rate in two case studies with
significant occlusions, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of our
approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/lineojcd/GSNBV

Conclusion: 移动增材制造平台结合模型预测控制，能够显著提升生产灵活性和打印质量，适用于动态制造环境。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in
the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a
promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater
flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However,
traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker
dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile
robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting
products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM
systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for
preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have
been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often
neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally,
these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small,
intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a
mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while
maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are
used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上验证，相比基线方法（Kalman难度和TTP），该方法能识别更复杂和互补的情境。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自动驾驶测试数据的质量，相关风险数据已开源。

Abstract: Improving automated vehicle software requires driving data rich in valuable
road user interactions. In this paper, we propose a risk-based filtering
approach that helps identify such valuable driving situations from large
datasets. Specifically, we use a probabilistic risk model to detect high-risk
situations. Our method stands out by considering a) first-order situations
(where one vehicle directly influences another and induces risk) and b)
second-order situations (where influence propagates through an intermediary
vehicle). In experiments, we show that our approach effectively selects
valuable driving situations in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Compared to the
two baseline interaction metrics of Kalman difficulty and Tracks-To-Predict
(TTP), our filtering approach identifies complex and complementary situations,
enriching the quality in automated vehicle testing. The risk data is made

Conclusion: 该系统有望显著改善复杂现实场景中的机器人护送服务。

Abstract: The deployment of robot assistants in large indoor spaces has seen
significant growth, with escorting tasks becoming a key application. However,
most current escorting robots primarily rely on navigation-focused strategies,
assuming that the person being escorted will follow without issue. In crowded
environments, this assumption often falls short, as individuals may struggle to
keep pace, become obstructed, get distracted, or need to stop unexpectedly. As
a result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective
escorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement
dynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must
continuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process
and adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing
dataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of
escorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where
other individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to
identify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting
their actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification
and action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network
architecture that can accomplish both tasks. This enables the robot to adjust
its speed dynamically based on the escortee's movements and seamlessly resume
escorting after any disruption. In comparative evaluations against strong
baselines, our system demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness,
showcasing its potential to significantly improve robotic escorting services in
complex, real-world scenarios.

Method: 提出基于邻近图的通道检测和自由空间分解方法，并开发了采样算法解决PTOPP问题。

Result: PTOPP在配置性、最优性和效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PTOPP为自由空间优化提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e.,
passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths'
traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP
is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its
entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As
passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core
idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its
accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection
and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed,
enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment
decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with
accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems
compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based
algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are
developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check.
All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and
efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based
methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution
optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It
is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free
space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad
class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.

Abstract: The adoption of mobile robotic platforms in complex environments, such as
agricultural settings, requires these systems to exhibit a flexible yet
effective architecture that integrates perception and control. In such
scenarios, several tasks need to be accomplished simultaneously, ranging from
managing robot limits to performing operational tasks and handling human
inputs. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive control
architecture for achieving complex tasks such as robotized harvesting in
vineyards within the framework of the European project CANOPIES. In detail, a
16-DOF dual-arm mobile robot is employed, controlled via a Hierarchical
Quadratic Programming (HQP) approach capable of handling both equality and
inequality constraints at various priorities to harvest grape bunches selected
by the perception system developed within the project. Furthermore, given the
complexity of the scenario and the uncertainty in the perception system, which
could potentially lead to collisions with the environment, the handling of
interaction forces is necessary. Remarkably, this was achieved using the same
HQP framework. This feature is further leveraged to enable semi-autonomous
operations, allowing a human operator to assist the robotic counterpart in
completing harvesting tasks. Finally, the obtained results are validated
through extensive testing conducted first in a laboratory environment to prove
individual functionalities, then in a real vineyard, encompassing both
autonomous and semi-autonomous grape harvesting operations.

TL;DR: PAC Bench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在物理属性、可操作性和约束理解方面的基准，揭示了当前模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在机器人操作任务中广泛应用，但其对低层物理前提的理解能力尚未验证，影响了任务的可靠性。

Method: 通过PAC Bench基准，系统评估VLMs对属性、可操作性和约束的理解，包含多样化的数据集和任务。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在基础物理概念理解上存在显著不足，限制了其在机器人操作中的可靠性。

Conclusion: PAC Bench为评估和改进VLMs的物理推理能力提供了标准化工具，推动更鲁棒的模型开发。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot
manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and
failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications
often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a
capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions
reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,
weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical
constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being
closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue
that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded
understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of
core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability
perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations,
comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1
to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios,
and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks.
  Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to
grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their
suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for
targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for
rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of
more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and realistic interactions between automated driving systems
and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban environments requires advanced
testing methodologies. This paper presents a test environment that combines a
Vehiclein-the-Loop (ViL) test bench with a motion laboratory, demonstrating the
feasibility of cyber-physical (CP) testing of vehicle-pedestrian and
vehicle-cyclist interactions. Building upon previous work focused on pedestrian
localization, we further validate a human pose estimation (HPE) approach
through a comparative analysis of real-world (RW) and virtual representations
of VRUs. The study examines the perception of full-body motion using a
commercial monocular camera-based 3Dskeletal detection AI. The virtual scene is
generated in Unreal Engine 5, where VRUs are animated in real time and
projected onto a screen to stimulate the camera. The proposed stimulation
technique ensures the correct perspective, enabling realistic vehicle
perception. To assess the accuracy and consistency of HPE across RW and CP
domains, we analyze the reliability of detections as well as variations in
movement trajectories and joint estimation stability. The validation includes
dynamic test scenarios where human avatars, both walking and cycling, are
monitored under controlled conditions. Our results show a strong alignment in
HPE between RW and CP test conditions for stable motion patterns, while notable
inaccuracies persist under dynamic movements and occlusions, particularly for
complex cyclist postures. These findings contribute to refining CP testing
approaches for evaluating next-generation AI-based vehicle perception and to
enhancing interaction models of automated vehicles and VRUs in CP environments.

Conclusion: 多时间尺度分层强化学习方法有效解决了驾驶行为波动和优化问题，提升了驾驶效率与安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD)
and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy
structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle
control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in
network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals
cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore,
we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our
approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL
policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and
short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is
explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving
behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state
updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure
multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based
highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action
consistency and safety.

Abstract: Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative
capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task
is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception,
planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately.
Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action
sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies
perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive
control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic
models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily
applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face
elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics,
directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of
accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.

Abstract: Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

Abstract: The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key
component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk
information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory
planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by
current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a
predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent
and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of
objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型结肠镜训练系统，通过双控机制实现专家实时指导，加速新手技能掌握。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结肠镜培训依赖工具交接，限制了新手多指同步控制技能的发展，需要实时专家指导工具。

Method: 设计了一种双控结肠镜训练系统，支持专家与新手实时切换控制结肠镜角度轮。

Result: 初步用户研究表明，该系统能有效帮助新手掌握技能。

Conclusion: 该系统有望加速结肠镜技能学习，未来可支持个性化教学和双向驱动教学。

Abstract: New endoscopists require a large volume of expert-proctored colonoscopies to
attain minimal competency. Developing multi-fingered, synchronized control of a
colonoscope requires significant time and exposure to the device. Current
training methods inhibit this development by relying on tool hand-off for
expert demonstrations. There is a need for colonoscopy training tools that
enable in-hand expert guidance in real-time. We present a new concept of a
tandem training system that uses a telemanipulated preceptor colonoscope to
guide novice users as they perform a colonoscopy. This system is capable of
dual-control and can automatically toggle between expert and novice control of
a standard colonoscope's angulation control wheels. Preliminary results from a
user study with novice and expert users show the effectiveness of this device
as a skill acquisition tool. We believe that this device has the potential to
accelerate skill acquisition for colonoscopy and, in the future, enable
individualized instruction and responsive teaching through bidirectional
actuation.

### [507] [Evaluating Sound Similarity Metrics for Differentiable, Iterative Sound-Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22628)
*Amir Salimi,Abram Hindle,Osmar R. Zaiane*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文探讨了迭代式声音匹配中损失函数的选择问题，发现其性能高度依赖于合成器类型，建议针对特定合成技术开发定制化相似性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索是否存在一种通用的最优损失函数，还是损失函数的选择应基于合成方法和设计师偏好。

Method: 采用可微分迭代声音匹配方法，结合四种损失函数与三种合成器，进行了300次随机声音匹配试验。

Result: 结果表明损失函数性能与合成器类型高度相关，三种性能度量（参数差异、频谱距离、主观听感评分）一致性中等。

Conclusion: 结论是应扩展声音匹配实验范围，开发针对特定合成技术的相似性度量，而非追求通用解决方案。

Abstract: Manual sound design with a synthesizer is inherently iterative: an artist
compares the synthesized output to a mental target, adjusts parameters, and
repeats until satisfied. Iterative sound-matching automates this workflow by
continually programming a synthesizer under the guidance of a loss function (or
similarity measure) toward a target sound. Prior comparisons of loss functions
have typically favored one metric over another, but only within narrow
settings: limited synthesis methods, few loss types, often without blind
listening tests. This leaves open the question of whether a universally optimal
loss exists, or the choice of loss remains a creative decision conditioned on
the synthesis method and the sound designer's preference. We propose
differentiable iterative sound-matching as the natural extension of the
available literature, since it combines the manual approach to sound design
with modern advances in machine learning. To analyze the variability of loss
function performance across synthesizers, we implemented a mix of four novel
and established differentiable loss functions, and paired them with
differentiable subtractive, additive, and AM synthesizers. For each of the
sixteen synthesizer--loss combinations, we ran 300 randomized sound-matching
trials. Performance was measured using parameter differences,
spectrogram-distance metrics, and manually assigned listening scores. We
observed a moderate level of consistency among the three performance measures.
Our post-hoc analysis shows that the loss function performance is highly
dependent on the synthesizer. These findings underscore the value of expanding
the scope of sound-matching experiments and developing new similarity metrics
tailored to specific synthesis techniques rather than pursuing
one-size-fits-all solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经音频指纹识别方法在训练中不切实际地模拟音频退化，导致监督不足，且未充分利用现代度量学习进展。

Method: 提出利用音乐信号特性和真实房间声学增强自监督，并系统评估多种度量学习方法。

Result: 自监督的三元组损失表现最佳，且多正样本训练对不同损失函数有不同影响。方法在合成和真实数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过改进自监督和度量学习方法，显著提升了音频指纹识别的性能。

Abstract: Audio fingerprinting (AFP) allows the identification of unknown audio content
by extracting compact representations, termed audio fingerprints, that are
designed to remain robust against common audio degradations. Neural AFP methods
often employ metric learning, where representation quality is influenced by the
nature of the supervision and the utilized loss function. However, recent work
unrealistically simulates real-life audio degradation during training,
resulting in sub-optimal supervision. Additionally, although several modern
metric learning approaches have been proposed, current neural AFP methods
continue to rely on the NT-Xent loss without exploring the recent advances or
classical alternatives. In this work, we propose a series of best practices to
enhance the self-supervision by leveraging musical signal properties and
realistic room acoustics. We then present the first systematic evaluation of
various metric learning approaches in the context of AFP, demonstrating that a
self-supervised adaptation of the triplet loss yields superior performance. Our
results also reveal that training with multiple positive samples per anchor has
critically different effects across loss functions. Our approach is built upon
these insights and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both a large,
synthetically degraded dataset and a real-world dataset recorded using
microphones in diverse music venues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音嵌入常保留敏感属性（如说话者身份、口音或人口统计信息），可能导致模型训练偏见和隐私泄露。

Method: 利用Donsker-Varadhan公式的互信息估计，指导基于互信息的编码器，系统性过滤敏感属性，同时保留任务相关的语音内容。

Result: 在三个已知数据集上，WavShape将嵌入与敏感属性的互信息减少81%，同时保留97%的任务相关信息。

Conclusion: 通过结合信息论与自监督语音模型，WavShape推动了公平、隐私感知且资源高效的语音系统的发展。

Abstract: Speech embeddings often retain sensitive attributes such as speaker identity,
accent, or demographic information, posing risks in biased model training and
privacy leakage. We propose WavShape, an information-theoretic speech
representation learning framework that optimizes embeddings for fairness and
privacy while preserving task-relevant information. We leverage mutual
information (MI) estimation using the Donsker-Varadhan formulation to guide an
MI-based encoder that systematically filters sensitive attributes while
maintaining speech content essential for downstream tasks. Experimental results
on three known datasets show that WavShape reduces MI between embeddings and
sensitive attributes by up to 81% while retaining 97% of task-relevant
information. By integrating information theory with self-supervised speech
models, this work advances the development of fair, privacy-aware, and
resource-efficient speech systems.

Motivation: 现有数据集多为孤立词或短句，限制了DSR研究的发展，SAP项目发布的大规模数据集为研究提供了新机会。

Method: 采用自训练方法增加训练数据，并适应推理中可能的不完整语音片段。

Result: 在SAP挑战赛中，系统在词错误率和语义得分上均排名第二。

Conclusion: 自训练方法显著提升了Whisper模型对长语音的识别能力，为DSR研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition (DSR) enhances the accessibility of smart
devices for dysarthric speakers with limited mobility. Previously, DSR research
was constrained by the fact that existing datasets typically consisted of
isolated words, command phrases, and a limited number of sentences spoken by a
few individuals. This constrained research to command-interaction systems and
speaker adaptation. The Speech Accessibility Project (SAP) changed this by
releasing a large and diverse English dysarthric dataset, leading to the SAP
Challenge to build speaker- and text-independent DSR systems. We enhanced the
Whisper model's performance on long dysarthric speech via a novel self-training
method. This method increased training data and adapted the model to handle
potentially incomplete speech segments encountered during inference. Our system
achieved second place in both Word Error Rate and Semantic Score in the SAP
Challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索音乐生成中的概念层次结构（如音乐想法的生成、转换和组织），以提升音乐的结构连贯性和创作质量。

Method: 引入TOMI方法，利用稀疏四维空间（片段、段落、轨道、转换）表示多轨音乐生成过程，并通过指令调优的LLM实现模型。

Result: 实验表明，TOMI生成的电子音乐在质量和结构连贯性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TOMI方法为音乐生成提供了新的层次化思路，并通过与REAPER的集成实现了人机协同创作。

Abstract: Hierarchical planning is a powerful approach to model long sequences
structurally. Aside from considering hierarchies in the temporal structure of
music, this paper explores an even more important aspect: concept hierarchy,
which involves generating music ideas, transforming them, and ultimately
organizing them--across musical time and space--into a complete composition. To
this end, we introduce TOMI (Transforming and Organizing Music Ideas) as a
novel approach in deep music generation and develop a TOMI-based model via
instruction-tuned foundation LLM. Formally, we represent a multi-track
composition process via a sparse, four-dimensional space characterized by clips
(short audio or MIDI segments), sections (temporal positions), tracks
(instrument layers), and transformations (elaboration methods). Our model is
capable of generating multi-track electronic music with full-song structure,
and we further integrate the TOMI-based model with the REAPER digital audio
workstation, enabling interactive human-AI co-creation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach produces higher-quality electronic music with
stronger structural coherence compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 研究成功发布了普莱斯作品的数字目录及伴奏生成模型，为音乐研究和生成技术提供了新资源。

Abstract: Florence B. Price was a composer in the early 20th century whose music
reflects her upbringing in the American South, her African heritage, and her
Western classical training. She is noted as the first African-American woman to
have a symphony performed by a major orchestra. Her music has recently received
renewed attention from both the public and the research community, decades
after her death. In addition to other genres, Price was a prolific composer for
solo voice and piano. Music historians have documented the existence of 134 art
songs and piano/voice arrangements for spirituals and folk songs written by
Price. We release a digital catalog of 112 of these works in MuseScore,
MusicXML, MIDI, and PDF format. We also use this dataset to fine-tune a
symbolic music generation model to generate accompaniments to melodies, and we
conduct a blind listening experiment that shows that accompaniments generated
by our model are perceived as being reflective of Florence Price's style more
frequently than accompaniments generated by a baseline model. We release our
model as the Florence Price Piano Accompaniment Generator alongside our
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音编解码器难以同时满足高质量音频重建和语言模型建模的需求，需要一种能平衡语义和声学性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出XY-Tokenizer，采用多阶段多任务学习方法，缓解语义与声学能力之间的冲突。

Result: XY-Tokenizer在语义和声学任务上均表现优异，文本对齐能力超越SpeechTokenizer和Mimi，声学重建性能接近BigCodec。

Conclusion: XY-Tokenizer在平衡语义和声学性能方面表现出色，为语音语言模型提供了更优的编解码方案。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language
models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve
acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However,
existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction
with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic
fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict
between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task
learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves
performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of
state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those
existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer
achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling
methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker
similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The
reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec,
the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a
speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/gyt1145028706/XY-Tokenizer.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对第二语言（L2）学习者的文本转语音（TTS）系统，通过调整元音时长差异提升清晰度，实验表明其效果优于整体语速减慢，但听众感知与实际效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对L2学习者在理解英语时的困难，尤其是元音时长差异导致的听力障碍，设计更有效的TTS系统以提高其听力理解能力。

Method: 利用美国英语中紧张元音（较长）和松弛元音（较短）的时长差异，在Matcha-TTS系统中创建“清晰模式”，并通过感知实验验证效果。

Result: 实验显示，清晰模式减少了法语母语L2学习者的转录错误（至少9.15%），且被认为更鼓舞人心和尊重，但听众误以为整体语速减慢更清晰。Whisper-ASR未能有效评估L2学习者的理解难度。

Conclusion: 清晰模式显著提升L2学习者的听力理解，但听众感知与实际效果存在差异，且现有ASR系统不适用于评估此类TTS系统的效果。

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Conclusion: E2PANNs为紧急车辆警报声识别提供了高效解决方案，适用于实时监控和安全关键应用。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the
integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring
systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are
limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational
demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces
E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework,
specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated
subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across
multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The
experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and
real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses
exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into
the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct
spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real
time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection
metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results
demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research
domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based
audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: RELATE数据集和提出的模型为文本到音频相关性评估提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In text-to-audio (TTA) research, the relevance between input text and output
audio is an important evaluation aspect. Traditionally, it has been evaluated
from both subjective and objective perspectives. However, subjective evaluation
is costly in terms of money and time, and objective evaluation is unclear
regarding the correlation to subjective evaluation scores. In this study, we
construct RELATE, an open-sourced dataset that subjectively evaluates the
relevance. Also, we benchmark a model for automatically predicting the
subjective evaluation score from synthesized audio. Our model outperforms a
conventional CLAPScore model, and that trend extends to many sound categories.

Conclusion: TinyWave模型优化了在普通硬件上的部署，适用于实时对话代理、辅助技术和低资源环境，并开源了模型和代码以支持可重复研究。

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of
many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation
models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention

minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter
models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on

using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations.
Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity
points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97%
of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These
models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling
applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and
low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation

Abstract: We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models
trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first
pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively
smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical
continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce
general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to
symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative
model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains
competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification
benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve
state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning
demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often
requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 探讨对比自监督学习（SSL）与Transformer结合在局部音乐信息检索任务中的有效性，打破传统认为其仅适用于全局任务的观念。

Method: 使用轻量级一维视觉Transformer（ViT-1D）和简单的对比SSL（NT-Xent损失）进行训练，分析序列令牌的表现。

Result: 序列令牌在局部任务中表现意外良好，且高层音乐特征（如起始点）从注意力图中显现。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了对比SSL与Transformer结合的潜力，为音乐信息检索中的序列建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning
for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as
automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is
widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised
models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g.,
masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the
potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We
consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the
time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL
through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although
NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks
to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence
tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens
offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful
properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform
unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore,
high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention
maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different
musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but
advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some
overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence
modeling in MIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖全局感受野，难以实现流式能力，而直接逐令牌生成语音会导致音频质量下降。

Method: 设计局部块级感受野策略，将序列分段并引入块级注意力掩码，结合分层注意力调节DiT的感受野。

Result: StreamFlow在语音质量上与非流式方法相当，优于其他流式方法，且首次包延迟仅为180毫秒。

Conclusion: StreamFlow有效解决了流式语音生成中的质量和延迟问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have
highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality,
particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating
semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities
due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly
implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in
degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a
novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with
diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation
issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local
block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first
segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable
the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.
These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks
to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective
experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance
comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in
terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time
during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable
first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples:

crawl and score audio recordings from the internet based on their metadata,
followed by a stage of pruning and segmentation using an audio classifier. The
resulting dataset contains over one million distinct MIDI files, comprising
roughly 100,000 hours of transcribed audio. We provide an in-depth analysis of

### [522] [Learning Individual Reproductive Behavior from Aggregate Fertility Rates via Neural Posterior Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22607)
*Daniel Ciganda,Ignacio Campón,Iñaki Permanyer,Jakob H Macke*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯框架和神经后验估计的方法，从宏观生育率数据中推断个体行为参数，并成功应用于多国数据预测微观生育行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的年龄别生育率（ASFRs）数据无法揭示驱动生育趋势的个体行为机制，因此需要一种方法从宏观数据中恢复这些机制。

Method: 开发了一种无似然贝叶斯框架，结合个体生育模型和序列神经后验估计（SNPE），从ASFRs和计划与非计划生育年龄分布中推断八种行为与生物参数。

Result: 该方法成功应用于美国和拉美国家的数据，不仅重现了观察到的生育模式，还预测了未参与估计的微观行为分布（如首次性行为年龄、生育间隔等）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成完整的合成生命史，支持行为明确的人口预测和人口数字孪生的构建。

Abstract: While age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) provide the most extensive record
of reproductive change, their aggregate nature masks the underlying behavioral
mechanisms that ultimately drive fertility trends. To recover these mechanisms,
we develop a likelihood-free Bayesian framework that couples an
individual-level model of the reproductive process with Sequential Neural
Posterior Estimation (SNPE). This allows us to infer eight behavioral and
biological parameters from just two aggregate series: ASFRs and the age-profile
of planned versus unplanned births. Applied to U.S. National Survey of Family
Growth cohorts and to Demographic and Health Survey cohorts from Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, and Peru, the method reproduces observed fertility
schedules and, critically, predicts out-of-sample micro-level distributions of
age at first sex, inter-birth intervals, and family-size ideals, none of which
inform the estimation step. Because the fitted model yields complete synthetic
life histories, it enables behaviorally explicit population forecasts and
supports the construction of demographic digital twins.

### [523] [Arnoldi Singular Vector perturbations for machine learning weather prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22450)

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了机器学习天气预测（MLWP）对初始条件误差的敏感性，提出了一种名为Arnoldi-SV（A-SV）的方法，无需线性或伴随模型，适用于数值天气预报（NWP）和MLWP。该方法通过迭代应用预测模型生成扰动模式，揭示了24小时Pangu Weather模型中的动态有意义扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于天气预报本质上具有不确定性，可靠的决策需要未来天气情景的可能性信息。研究旨在探索MLWP对初始条件误差的敏感性，并开发一种无需线性或伴随模型的方法。

Method: 提出A-SV方法，通过迭代应用预测模型生成Krylov子空间，近似局部误差增长，并提取动态有意义的扰动模式。

Result: A-SV成功找到24小时Pangu Weather模型中的动态有意义扰动模式，这些扰动从预测开始即增长，可用于初始化MLWP集合。

Conclusion: A-SV方法为MLWP提供了一种有效的扰动生成方式，揭示了局部不稳定模式，并与扩散模型GenCast的降噪过程存在相似性。

Abstract: Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making
requires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore
the sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h
Pangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a
specific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)
method does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to
numerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth
within a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast
model to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly
based on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each
iteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are
expected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed
finds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather
model, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These
perturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize
MLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the
algorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference
state - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic
diffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities
and differences.

TL;DR: 论文研究了未来城市系统中车队集体路径规划对交通管理的影响，证明了在特定条件下逆向车队分配问题是否有解，并探讨了实际应用中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车队路径规划可能影响城市交通网络的稳定性，因此需要研究如何通过车队规模和行为推断其路径选择。

Method: 引入正向车队分配算子并研究其性质，证明其在特定条件下可逆。同时比较了自私、Stackelberg和Nash路径规划的差异。

Result: 证明逆向车队分配问题在自私策略下可解，而在其他策略下不可解。Stackelberg路径规划可能导致交通网络混乱。

Conclusion: 自私车队策略下逆向问题可解，但实际应用中需注意Stackelberg策略可能带来的交通混乱。

Abstract: Detection of collectively routing fleets of vehicles in future urban systems
may become important for the management of traffic, as such routing may
destabilize urban networks leading to deterioration of driving conditions.
Accordingly, in this paper we discuss the question whether it is possible to
determine the flow of fleet vehicles on all routes given the fleet size and
behaviour as well as the combined total flow of fleet and non-fleet vehicles on
every route. We prove that the answer to this Inverse Fleet Assignment Problem
is 'yes' for myopic fleet strategies which are more 'selfish' than
'altruistic', and 'no' otherwise, under mild assumptions on route/link
performance functions. To reach these conclusions we introduce the forward
fleet assignment operator and study its properties, proving that it is
invertible for 'bad' objectives of fleet controllers. We also discuss the
challenges of implementing myopic fleet routing in the real world and compare
it to Stackelberg and Nash routing. Finally, we show that optimal Stackelberg
fleet routing could involve highly variable mixed strategies in some scenarios,
which would likely cause chaos in the traffic network.

*Krisanu Sarkar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: HGM是一种自适应学习率优化算法，通过评估梯度方向一致性来调整学习率，优于传统方法如Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应优化方法（如Adam）仅基于梯度幅度调整学习率，忽略了方向信息，HGM旨在利用几何线索（如梯度方向一致性）提升优化效果。

Method: HGM通过计算当前梯度与累积动量的余弦相似性，动态调整学习率，方向一致时增加学习率，不一致时减少。

Result: HGM在平滑区域加速收敛，在复杂区域保持稳定，计算效率与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: HGM通过更智能地响应优化地形结构，在非凸问题（如深度学习）中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Hindsight-Guided Momentum (HGM), a first-order optimization
algorithm that adaptively scales learning rates based on the directional
consistency of recent updates. Traditional adaptive methods, such as Adam or
RMSprop , adapt learning dynamics using only the magnitude of gradients, often
overlooking important geometric cues.Geometric cues refer to directional
information, such as the alignment between current gradients and past updates,
which reflects the local curvature and consistency of the optimization path.
HGM addresses this by incorporating a hindsight mechanism that evaluates the
cosine similarity between the current gradient and accumulated momentum. This
allows it to distinguish between coherent and conflicting gradient directions,
increasing the learning rate when updates align and reducing it in regions of
oscillation or noise. The result is a more responsive optimizer that
accelerates convergence in smooth regions of the loss surface while maintaining
stability in sharper or more erratic areas. Despite this added adaptability,
the method preserves the computational and memory efficiency of existing
optimizers.By more intelligently responding to the structure of the
optimization landscape, HGM provides a simple yet effective improvement over
existing approaches, particularly in non-convex settings like that of deep
neural network training.

*Ofer M. Shir,Michael Emmerich*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了整数进化策略（IESs）的基础，通过采用ℓ₁范数和研究离散概率分布（如截断正态和双几何分布），优化了整数规划问题的求解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管整数规划（IP）的理论复杂性已降低，启发式方法仍是主要求解手段。研究旨在为连续空间设计的随机搜索启发式方法（IESs）建立离散搜索基础。

Method: 采用ℓ₁范数，研究适合的步长和量化整数格上相关性的方法，重点分析无界整数决策变量的变异分布，比较截断正态（TN）和双几何（DG）分布的理论性质。

Result: 数值模拟表明，双几何分布更适合无界整数搜索，相关DG变异的IES在非可分二次IP中表现更优。

Conclusion: 用DG替换默认的TN分布理论上合理且实践有益，但关键改进在于采用ℓ₁范数而非ℓ₂范数。

Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the
complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant
problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the
groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized
search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel
in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by
applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while
persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay
foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for
the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify
correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for
unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate
discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which
we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down
to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We
explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose
a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our
investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which
consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for
unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical
evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other
strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the
replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified
and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the
$\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用深度神经网络（DNN）近似无限时间马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中Q函数的方法，证明了在特定条件下，DNN能以多项式复杂度实现L2意义上的近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MDP中Q函数的近似问题，为强化学习理论提供更高效的数值方法。

Method: 利用带有leaky ReLU激活的DNN近似MDP的回报函数和随机转移动态，并通过MLFP方案证明Q函数的DNN近似可行性。

Result: 证明了在状态空间维度d和误差倒数1/ε的多项式复杂度下，DNN能有效近似Q函数。

Conclusion: DNN在特定条件下能够高效近似MDP中的Q函数，为强化学习的数值实现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discrete time stochastic optimal control problems and Markov decision
processes (MDPs) are fundamental models for sequential decision-making under
uncertainty and as such provide the mathematical framework underlying
reinforcement learning theory. A central tool for solving MDPs is the Bellman
equation and its solution, the so-called $Q$-function. In this article, we
construct deep neural network (DNN) approximations for $Q$-functions associated
to MDPs with infinite time horizon and finite control set $A$. More
specifically, we show that if the the payoff function and the random transition
dynamics of the MDP can be suitably approximated by DNNs with leaky rectified
linear unit (ReLU) activation, then the solutions $Q_d\colon \mathbb R^d\to
\mathbb R^{|A|}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, of the associated Bellman equations can
also be approximated in the $L^2$-sense by DNNs with leaky ReLU activation
whose numbers of parameters grow at most polynomially in both the dimension
$d\in \mathbb{N}$ of the state space and the reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the
prescribed error $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$. Our proof relies on the recently
introduced full-history recursive multilevel fixed-point (MLFP) approximation
scheme.

*Alexander Tyurin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文研究了分布式优化中的通信限制，证明了在服务器到工作节点的通信时间影响下，使用无偏稀疏化压缩器无法同时优化服务器端通信时间和方差相关运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化的主要动机是通过增加工作节点数量（n）实现可扩展性，但通信时间（如服务器到工作节点的传输时间）成为瓶颈。

Method: 通过构造新的“最坏情况”函数和开发新的下界框架，将分析简化为随机和的集中性，并证明其集中性边界。

Result: 结果表明，即使在同质（i.i.d.）情况下，也无法设计出在服务器端通信时间和方差相关运行时间上优于多对数（poly-logarithmic）扩展的方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了分布式优化在可扩展性方面的根本限制，即使在同质假设下也无法避免。

Abstract: We consider centralized distributed optimization in the classical federated
learning setup, where $n$ workers jointly find an $\varepsilon$-stationary
point of an $L$-smooth, $d$-dimensional nonconvex function $f$, having access
only to unbiased stochastic gradients with variance $\sigma^2$. Each worker
requires at most $h$ seconds to compute a stochastic gradient, and the
communication times from the server to the workers and from the workers to the
server are $\tau_{s}$ and $\tau_{w}$ seconds per coordinate, respectively. One
of the main motivations for distributed optimization is to achieve scalability
with respect to $n$. For instance, it is well known that the distributed
version of SGD has a variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L
\Delta}{n \varepsilon^2},$ which improves with the number of workers $n,$ where
$\Delta = f(x^0) - f^*,$ and $x^0 \in R^d$ is the starting point. Similarly,
using unbiased sparsification compressors, it is possible to reduce both the
variance-dependent runtime term and the communication runtime term. However,
once we account for the communication from the server to the workers
$\tau_{s}$, we prove that it becomes infeasible to design a method using
unbiased random sparsification compressors that scales both the server-side
communication runtime term $\tau_{s} d \frac{L \Delta}{\varepsilon}$ and the
variance-dependent runtime term $\frac{h \sigma^2 L \Delta}{\varepsilon^2},$
better than poly-logarithmically in $n$, even in the homogeneous (i.i.d.) case,
where all workers access the same distribution. To establish this result, we
construct a new "worst-case" function and develop a new lower bound framework
that reduces the analysis to the concentration of a random sum, for which we
prove a concentration bound. These results reveal fundamental limitations in
scaling distributed optimization, even under the homogeneous assumption.

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法能有效平衡解的分散性和收敛性，减少决策空间的偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了多目标优化的解质量，避免了决策空间中解聚集的偏差。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off
between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the
objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP
solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the
convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a
Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's
preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions
in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution
concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space
intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution
diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of
solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific
region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method
enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively
balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision
space.

Result: 实验表明，尽管CBO与NES有相似性，但在某些情况下CBO表现更优。

Conclusion: CBO在封闭盒对抗攻击中具有竞争力，为无梯度优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) has established itself as an efficient
gradient-free optimization scheme, with attractive mathematical properties,
such as mean-field convergence results for non-convex loss functions. In this
work, we study CBO in the context of closed-box adversarial attacks, which are
imperceptible input perturbations that aim to fool a classifier, without
accessing its gradient. Our contribution is to establish a connection between
the so-called consensus hopping as introduced by Riedl et al. and natural
evolution strategies (NES) commonly applied in the context of adversarial
attacks and to rigorously relate both methods to gradient-based optimization
schemes. Beyond that, we provide a comprehensive experimental study that shows
that despite the conceptual similarities, CBO can outperform NES and other
evolutionary strategies in certain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流形值数据在颜色恢复、旋转信息研究和图像处理中具有重要作用，现有方法需要扩展到新数据类型（如多二进制和Stiefel值数据）。

Method: 将数据嵌入欧几里得空间，通过半正定矩阵编码流形，并松弛秩约束以实现凸化，提出TV和Tikhonov去噪模型。

Result: 在合成实验中验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 扩展的去噪方法适用于新数据类型，并通过凸化技术实现高效求解。

Abstract: The handling of manifold-valued data, for instance, plays a central role in
color restoration tasks relying on circle- or sphere-valued color models, in
the study of rotational or directional information related to the special
orthogonal group, and in Gaussian image processing, where the pixel statistics
are interpreted as values on the hyperbolic sheet. Especially, to denoise these
kind of data, there have been proposed several generalizations of total
variation (TV) and Tikhonov-type denoising models incorporating the underlying
manifolds. Recently, a novel, numerically efficient denoising approach has been
introduced, where the data are embedded in an Euclidean ambient space, the
non-convex manifolds are encoded by a series of positive semi-definite,
fixed-rank matrices, and the rank constraint is relaxed to obtain a
convexification that can be solved using standard algorithms from convex
analysis. The aim of the present paper is to extent this approach to new kinds
of data like multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data. Multi-binary data can, for
instance, be used to model multi-color QR codes whereas Stiefel-valued data
occur in image and video-based recognition. For both new data types, we propose
TV- and Tikhonov-based denoising modelstogether with easy-to-solve
convexification. All derived methods are evaluated on proof-of-concept,
synthetic experiments.

Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of
multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic
climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary
statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current
autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically
struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical
system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in
high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models
under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another
with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,
the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses
in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial
observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper}
variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees
of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect
fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow
dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as
coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both
conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems
like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more
realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface
temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere,
assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and
interpretability.

Abstract: It is known that when multiple stimuli are present, top-down attention
selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant

of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli
in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down
attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within
100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional
resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant
stimuli.

Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and
generate information. These fixed points can be captured by the Boltzmann-Gibbs
measure, which leads to neural Langevin dynamics that can be used for sampling
and learning a real dataset. We call this type of generative model neural
Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of
distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived
as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore,
one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network,
mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin
machine may be another promising generative model, at least in its strength in
circuit-based sampling and biologically plausible learning rule.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个可扩展的框架，揭示了语义相似性在科学奖励动态中的作用，并提出了新的研究问题。

Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon
established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether
this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a
scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To
operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary
metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic
neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed
number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those
papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as
the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.
We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its
subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,
surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five
different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on
citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors
consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.
These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific
literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.
Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model
predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for
linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new
questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the
dynamics of scientific reward.

Abstract: Persistence is often regarded as a virtue in science. In this paper, however,
we challenge this conventional view by highlighting its contextual nature,
particularly how persistence can become a liability during periods of paradigm
shift. We focus on the deep learning revolution catalyzed by AlexNet in 2012.
Analyzing the 20-year career trajectories of over 5,000 scientists who were
active in top machine learning venues during the preceding decade, we examine
how their research focus and output evolved. We first uncover a dynamic period
in which leading venues increasingly prioritized cutting-edge deep learning
developments that displaced relatively traditional statistical learning
methods. Scientists responded to these changes in markedly different ways.
Those who were previously successful or affiliated with old teams adapted more
slowly, experiencing what we term a rigidity penalty - a reluctance to embrace
new directions leading to a decline in scientific impact, as measured by
citation percentile rank. In contrast, scientists who pursued strategic
adaptation - selectively pivoting toward emerging trends while preserving weak
connections to prior expertise - reaped the greatest benefits. Taken together,
our macro- and micro-level findings show that scientific breakthroughs act as
mechanisms that reconfigure power structures within a field.

### [537] [Data-Driven Self-Supervised Learning for the Discovery of Solution Singularity for Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23344)
*Difeng Cai,Paulina Sepúlveda*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督学习的框架，用于在数据驱动环境中检测函数中的奇点位置，解决了未知奇点对数值计算的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奇点的存在会显著影响数值计算的效率，尤其是在奇点位置未知的情况下。传统方法难以处理未标记的原始数据，因此需要一种新的数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督学习框架为奇点检测提供了一种高效的数据驱动解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a
fundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine
the effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical
integration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc.
The problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is
unknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity
is therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce
computational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider
singularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only
contains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the
limitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning
(SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component
is a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering
methods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density
estimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the
potential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without
filtering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the
proposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and
different kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer,
concentric semicircles, etc.

Result: 实验显示A/B测试显著改进，降低实验成本同时保持高统计功效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过战略中心极限定理证明，显著提升统计功效，适用于检测微小效应。

Abstract: Detecting a minor average treatment effect is a major challenge in
large-scale applications, where even minimal improvements can have a
significant economic impact. Traditional methods, reliant on normal
distribution-based or expanded statistics, often fail to identify such minor
effects because of their inability to handle small discrepancies with
sufficient sensitivity. This work leverages a counterfactual outcome framework
and proposes a maximum probability-driven two-armed bandit (TAB) process by
weighting the mean volatility statistic, which controls Type I error. The
implementation of permutation methods further enhances the robustness and
efficacy. The established strategic central limit theorem (SCLT) demonstrates
that our approach yields a more concentrated distribution under the null
hypothesis and a less concentrated one under the alternative hypothesis,
greatly improving statistical power. The experimental results indicate a
significant improvement in the A/B testing, highlighting the potential to
reduce experimental costs while maintaining high statistical power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散采样器需要重要性加权估计或复杂学习过程，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 基于Schrödinger Bridge理论，通过Adjoint Matching实现高效采样，并放宽了memoryless条件。

Result: ASBS在经典能量函数、构象生成和分子Boltzmann分布采样中表现出色。

Conclusion: ASBS是一种简单、可扩展且高效的扩散采样器，适用于多种采样任务。

Abstract: Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution
-- where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy
function -- have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit
target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as diffusion
samplers, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning
processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy
and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose
Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS), a new diffusion sampler that
employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to
estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical
model -- the Schr\"odinger Bridge -- which enhances sampling efficiency via
kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal
control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned
at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution.
Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to
arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition
that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy
functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann
distributions.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，BIP和VI-BIP比现有方法更准确且可扩展。

Conclusion: BIP在不变特征识别方面具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from
multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable
predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to
new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have
primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized
optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a
probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of
invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior
inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior
targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent
and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior
contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational
approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and
VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant
prediction.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中表现优于现有方法，并在低级别胶质瘤数据中发现临床相关亚型。

Conclusion: CN-SBM为拷贝数分析提供了可解释、可扩展的框架，对肿瘤异质性和预后有直接意义。

Abstract: Cancer is a genetic disorder whose clonal evolution can be monitored by
tracking noisy genome-wide copy number variants. We introduce the Copy Number
Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly
clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using
a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or
Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and
captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a
two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual
components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and
finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for
application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated
and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to
TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and
structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival
analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable
framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and
prognosis.

Abstract: The opacity of many supervised learning algorithms remains a key challenge,
hindering scientific discovery and limiting broader deployment -- particularly
in high-stakes domains. This paper develops model- and distribution-agnostic
significance tests to assess the influence of input features in any regression
or classification algorithm. Our method evaluates a feature's incremental
contribution to model performance by masking its values across samples. Under
the null hypothesis, the distribution of performance differences across a test
set has a non-positive median. We construct a uniformly most powerful,
randomized sign test for this median, yielding exact p-values for assessing
feature significance and confidence intervals with exact coverage for
estimating population-level feature importance. The approach requires minimal
assumptions, avoids model retraining or auxiliary models, and remains
computationally efficient even for large-scale, high-dimensional settings.
Experiments on synthetic tasks validate its statistical and computational
advantages, and applications to real-world data illustrate its practical
utility.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel machine learning approach to compute the

samples, based on the DeepParticle methods. The proposed method leads to a
min-min optimization during training and does not impose any restriction on the
network structure. Theoretically we establish a weak convergence guarantee and
a quantitative error bound between the learned map and the optimal transport
map. Our numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and the
effectiveness of the new approach, particularly on real-world tasks.

Conclusion: 本文方法在理论和实践中均表现优异，为协变量偏移下的矩估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Covariate shift occurs when the distribution of input features differs
between the training and testing phases. In covariate shift, estimating an
unknown function's moment is a classical problem that remains under-explored,
despite its common occurrence in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
investigate the minimax lower bound of the problem when the source and target
distributions are known. To achieve the minimax optimal bound (up to a
logarithmic factor), we propose a two-stage algorithm. Specifically, it first
trains an optimal estimator for the function under the source distribution, and
then uses a likelihood ratio reweighting procedure to calibrate the moment
estimator. In practice, the source and target distributions are typically
unknown, and estimating the likelihood ratio may be unstable. To solve this
problem, we propose a truncated version of the estimator that ensures double
robustness and provide the corresponding upper bound. Extensive numerical
studies on synthetic examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 评估Frechet回归中的部分效应，特别是在Bures Wasserstein流形上，需要一种有效的测试方法。

Method: 使用样本分割策略，一部分样本用于拟合Frechet回归模型，另一部分用于构建测试统计量。统计量渐近收敛于加权卡方混合分布。

Result: 测试统计量渐近收敛于加权卡方混合分布，方法在渐近规模上达到名义值，且最坏情况下的功效一致收敛于1。

Conclusion: 通过模拟和实际数据验证，该方法在有限样本下具有准确性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel test for assessing partial effects in Frechet regression
on Bures Wasserstein manifolds. Our approach employs a sample splitting
strategy: the first subsample is used to fit the Frechet regression model,
yielding estimates of the covariance matrices and their associated optimal
transport maps, while the second subsample is used to construct the test
statistic. We prove that this statistic converges in distribution to a weighted
mixture of chi squared components, where the weights correspond to the
eigenvalues of an integral operator defined by an appropriate RKHS kernel. We
establish that our procedure achieves the nominal asymptotic size and
demonstrate that its worst-case power converges uniformly to one. Through
extensive simulations and a real data application, we illustrate the test's
finite-sample accuracy and practical utility.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of optical engineering, precise alignment of
multi-lens imaging systems is critical yet challenging, as even minor
misalignments can significantly degrade performance. Traditional alignment
methods rely on specialized equipment and are time-consuming processes,
highlighting the need for automated and scalable solutions. We present two
complementary deep learning-based inverse-design methods for diagnosing
misalignments in multi-element lens systems using only optical measurements.
First, we use ray-traced spot diagrams to predict five-degree-of-freedom
(5-DOF) errors in a 6-lens photographic prime, achieving a mean absolute error
of 0.031mm in lateral translation and 0.011$^\circ$ in tilt. We also introduce
a physics-based simulation pipeline that utilizes grayscale synthetic camera
images, enabling a deep learning model to estimate 4-DOF, decenter and tilt
errors in both two- and six-lens multi-lens systems. These results show the
potential to reshape manufacturing and quality control in precision imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过代码开发、协作知识转移和技能发展影响开源软件（OSS）开发者。

Method: 利用意大利临时禁止ChatGPT的自然实验，采用双重差分法和双向固定效应分析GitHub上88,022名开发者的数据。

Result: ChatGPT使开发者生产力提升6.4%，知识共享提升9.6%，技能获取提升8.4%，效果因经验和任务复杂性而异。

Conclusion: LLMs的战略部署可加速新手开发者成长、促进协作学习，提升组织长期生产力和敏捷性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software
development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand
this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence
OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill
development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work
in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary
ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with
two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in
three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We
find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge
sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary
significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience
productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from
improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we
find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest
benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving
contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct
code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge
exchange among developers; dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic
understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial
implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers'
onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster
knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition,
together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在组织中的应用如何通过重新分配复杂性（而非消除）影响竞争策略。

Method: 提出Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS)框架，分析LLM对复杂性的重新分配。

Result: LLM的用户界面简单，但复杂性转移至基础设施和专业人员，带来新的管理挑战。

Conclusion: 竞争优势源于管理重新分配的复杂性，而非单纯采用AI，需设计抽象层和工作流对齐。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to
analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and
competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input
costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among
generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity
across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by
offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this
user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to
infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off,
therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the
organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy
in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer
stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity
through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary
expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition
relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.

Abstract: The promotion of the national education digitalization strategy has
facilitated the development of teaching quality evaluation towards all-round,
process-oriented, precise, and intelligent directions, inspiring explorations
into new methods and technologies for educational quality assurance. Classroom
teaching evaluation methods dominated by teaching supervision and student
teaching evaluation suffer from issues such as low efficiency, strong
subjectivity, and limited evaluation dimensions. How to further advance
intelligent and objective evaluation remains a topic to be explored. This
paper, based on image recognition technology, speech recognition technology,
and AI large language models, develops a comprehensive evaluation system that
automatically generates evaluation reports and optimization suggestions from
two dimensions: teacher teaching ability and classroom teaching effectiveness.
This study establishes a closed-loop classroom evaluation model that
comprehensively evaluates student and teaching conditions based on
multi-dimensional data throughout the classroom teaching process, and further
analyzes the data to guide teaching improvement. It meets the requirements of
all-round and process-oriented classroom evaluation in the era of digital
education, effectively solves the main problems of manual evaluation methods,
and provides data collection and analysis methods as well as technologies for
relevant research on educational teaching evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation
models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions
to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's
complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety
guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of
AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based
systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and
trustworthy?
  The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous
systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning
Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI
applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving
treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less
well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the
organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on
February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES
program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is
the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different
aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda
focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the
foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems.

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了理解和减轻AI系统中赌博心理模式的系统性框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors
analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence
bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from
behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these
"gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward
outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically
miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)
framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these
behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,
and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation
paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI
adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like
behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in
loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse
scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for
understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

Method: 设计了一个基于区块链和AI的框架，通过公开评论、身份关联和可复现性实现学术评审的透明化和动态化。

Result: 该系统能够激励学术贡献、捕捉知识演化过程，并支持可追溯的声誉动态。

Conclusion: 该模型将学术知识视为动态过程而非静态凭证，适用于从计算科学到人文的多个领域。

Abstract: This paper reconceptualises peer review as structured public commentary.
Traditional academic validation is hindered by anonymity, latency, and
gatekeeping. We propose a transparent, identity-linked, and reproducible system
of scholarly evaluation anchored in open commentary. Leveraging blockchain for
immutable audit trails and AI for iterative synthesis, we design a framework
that incentivises intellectual contribution, captures epistemic evolution, and
enables traceable reputational dynamics. This model empowers fields from
computational science to the humanities, reframing academic knowledge as a
living process rather than a static credential.

*Pratheeksha Nair,Gabriel Lefebvre,Sophia Garrel,Maryam Molamohammadi,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“激进质疑”（RQ）的五步伦理评估框架，用于在AI项目启动前评估其必要性，尤其是在涉及边缘群体和系统性不公的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术常被假设为解决复杂社会问题的工具，但在如人口贩卖（HT）等敏感领域，这种技术解决方案可能简化问题、加剧权力失衡并对目标群体造成伤害。

Method: RQ框架通过五个步骤，在项目设计前提供一个反思空间，以审视假设、分析权力关系和潜在危害。

Result: 通过HT案例研究，RQ揭示了被忽视的社会文化复杂性，并引导转向支持幸存者赋权的工具，而非基于监控的干预。

Conclusion: RQ不仅适用于HT领域，还可推广至其他领域，强调了一种挑战工具主义、关注关系和反思责任的AI伦理哲学。

Abstract: AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical
interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human
trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation,
reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims
to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework
as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate
whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized
populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles
based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to
confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case
study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural
complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward
survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five
step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions
must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics
philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational,
reflexive responsibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在复杂政策问题中的潜力，并研究气候紧急运动对地方政府政策的影响。

Method: 构建PALLM系统，使用GPT-4分析维多利亚州11个地方政府的政策文件，并与政策制定者验证结果。

Result: 通过CED的政府更倾向于制定近期和气候专项政策，并更关注紧迫性、优先级及社会公正。GPT-4能进行高级政策分析，但存在引用不可靠的局限性。

Conclusion: 大规模分析政策文件为政策研究提供了新机会，CED对地方政府政策有积极影响。

Abstract: This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local
government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency
movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through
the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series
of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the
aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer
complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM
(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.
This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency
response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the
performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by
generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria
and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.
Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to
conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local
governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the
methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils
which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is
capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of
reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.
Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more
likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to
urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which
have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale
opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.

Motivation: 研究NLP任务如何反映和放大社会偏见，尤其是性取向偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过调查和分析55篇量化性取向偏见的文献，探讨性取向的定义和操作化方式。

Result: 发现文献中性取向定义模糊，常混淆性别与性取向，导致对偏见的量化不准确。

Conclusion: 建议更深入地与酷儿社区和跨学科文献合作，改进性取向偏见的分析。

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as
wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of
multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and
amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this
scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and
(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work
in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and
operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify
sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a
majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or
normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we
find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often
conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of
queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving
sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that
encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and
interdisciplinary literature.

Motivation: 探讨LLM政治倾向评分的可靠性及其影响因素。

Method: 分析生成参数、提示词和微调对PCT评分的影响，并测试高政治内容数据集的效果。

Result: 生成参数无显著影响，提示词和微调影响显著，高政治内容数据集未导致评分差异。

Conclusion: 需深入研究PCT测试有效性及LLM政治倾向编码机制。

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to
quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that
examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard
generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores.
However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning
individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that
when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than
others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a
thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as
the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需显式说话人查询的自适应流式多说话人语音识别方法，通过动态调整实现即时说话人适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要目标说话人嵌入或注册音频，限制了灵活性和实时性。

Method: 通过说话人监督激活生成说话人特定核，注入到ASR编码层，实现动态适应。

Result: 在离线和流式场景中均达到最先进性能，有效处理严重语音重叠。

Conclusion: 该方法为严重重叠语音下的多说话人ASR提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker
automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit
speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker
embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR
instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation
involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision
activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous
speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech
even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in
both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive
method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined
speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker
adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe
overlapping speech conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合监督学习和自监督学习目标的多音高估计方法，显著提升了性能，但也发现了模型在监督数据和自监督数据上的过拟合现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多音高估计（MPE）是音乐信息检索（MIR）系统的关键能力，但现有方法依赖监督学习，而标注数据难以获取。自监督方法虽有潜力，但性能仍不及监督方法。

Method: 扩展了经典的监督MPE范式，引入了基于音高不变性和音高等变性的自监督目标，进行联合训练。

Result: 在封闭训练条件下性能显著提升，但在更广泛数据上应用时，模型在监督数据上过拟合，同时在自监督数据上性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了监督与自监督联合训练中的潜在问题，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multi-Pitch Estimation (MPE) continues to be a sought after capability of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems, and is critical for many
applications and downstream tasks involving pitch, including music
transcription. However, existing methods are largely based on supervised
learning, and there are significant challenges in collecting annotated data for
the task. Recently, self-supervised techniques exploiting intrinsic properties
of pitch and harmonic signals have shown promise for both monophonic and
polyphonic pitch estimation, but these still remain inferior to supervised
methods. In this work, we extend the classic supervised MPE paradigm by
incorporating several self-supervised objectives based on pitch-invariant and
pitch-equivariant properties. This joint training results in a substantial
improvement under closed training conditions, which naturally suggests that
applying the same objectives to a broader collection of data will yield further
improvements. However, in doing so we uncover a phenomenon whereby our model
simultaneously overfits to the supervised data while degenerating on data used
for self-supervision only. We demonstrate and investigate this and offer our
insights on the underlying problem.

Motivation: 探索CLAPScore与人类主观评分的关系，并改进其相关性。

Method: 通过训练基于主观评分的对比语言-音频模型（Human-CLAP）来改进CLAPScore。

Result: Human-CLAP将CLAPScore与主观评分的Spearman等级相关系数提高了0.25以上。

Conclusion: Human-CLAP显著提升了CLAPScore与人类主观评价的相关性。

Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) is widely used for audio
generation and recognition tasks. For example, CLAPScore, which utilizes the
similarity of CLAP embeddings, has been a major metric for the evaluation of
the relevance between audio and text in text-to-audio. However, the
relationship between CLAPScore and human subjective evaluation scores is still
unclarified. We show that CLAPScore has a low correlation with human subjective
evaluation scores. Additionally, we propose a human-perception-based CLAP
called Human-CLAP by training a contrastive language-audio model using the
subjective evaluation score. In our experiments, the results indicate that our
Human-CLAP improved the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) between
the CLAPScore and the subjective evaluation scores by more than 0.25 compared
with the conventional CLAP.

Result: 精心筛选的700小时数据训练的模型性能优于2500小时完整数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 数据质量比数据量更重要，数据筛选对语音增强系统的扩展至关重要。

Abstract: The vast majority of modern speech enhancement systems rely on data-driven
neural network models. Conventionally, larger datasets are presumed to yield
superior model performance, an observation empirically validated across
numerous tasks in other domains. However, recent studies reveal diminishing
returns when scaling speech enhancement data. We focus on a critical factor:
prevalent quality issues in ``clean'' training labels within large-scale
datasets. This work re-examines this phenomenon and demonstrates that, within
large-scale training sets, prioritizing high-quality training data is more
important than merely expanding the data volume. Experimental findings suggest
that models trained on a carefully curated subset of 700 hours can outperform
models trained on the 2,500-hour full dataset. This outcome highlights the
crucial role of data curation in scaling speech enhancement systems
effectively.

Motivation: 传统MOS评分需要大量人工标注，且现有深度学习方法（如DNSMOS和UTMOS）因训练数据不足而表现不佳。论文旨在通过相对排名而非绝对评分来更可靠地比较语音增强系统。

Method: 提出URGENT-PK方法，利用同源增强语音对的成对比较预测相对质量排名，充分利用有限训练数据。

Result: 在多个开放测试集上，URGENT-PK在系统级排名性能上优于现有基线方法，尽管其网络架构简单且训练数据有限。

Conclusion: URGENT-PK通过成对比较范式有效解决了数据不足问题，为语音增强系统提供了更可靠的比较方法。

Abstract: The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is fundamental to speech quality assessment.
However, its acquisition requires significant human annotation. Although deep
neural network approaches, such as DNSMOS and UTMOS, have been developed to
predict MOS to avoid this issue, they often suffer from insufficient training
data. Recognizing that the comparison of speech enhancement (SE) systems
prioritizes a reliable system comparison over absolute scores, we propose
URGENT-PK, a novel ranking approach leveraging pairwise comparisons. URGENT-PK
takes homologous enhanced speech pairs as input to predict relative quality
rankings. This pairwise paradigm efficiently utilizes limited training data, as
all pairwise permutations of multiple systems constitute a training instance.
Experiments across multiple open test sets demonstrate URGENT-PK's superior
system-level ranking performance over state-of-the-art baselines, despite its
simple network architecture and limited training data.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法缺乏深层场景理解且训练成本高，VoteSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 实验证明VoteSplat在开放词汇3D实例定位、点云理解等任务中有效。

Conclusion: VoteSplat为3D场景理解提供了高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

Abstract: In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and
novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses
and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are
challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based
refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera
movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification
approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both
camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor
scenes of various scales. Source code is available at

Motivation: 现有的无分类器引导（CFG）方法在引导尺度的选择上对生成结果影响显著，但固定尺度可能导致收敛问题。

Method: 设计了一种退火引导调度器，根据条件噪声信号动态调整引导尺度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了图像质量和提示对齐，且无需额外资源。

Conclusion: 动态调度器优于固定尺度CFG，为文本到图像生成提供了更好的权衡。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images
conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful
guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a
widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often
produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational
overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable
confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is
optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of
low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant.
In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the
quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs
between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are

TL;DR: GaVS是一种基于3D的视频稳定方法，通过局部重建和渲染范式解决现有方法的几何失真和裁剪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频稳定方法存在几何失真、过度裁剪和泛化能力差等问题，影响用户体验。

Method: GaVS利用3D相机位姿，通过高斯散射基元预测和测试时微调，结合多视角动态感知光度监督和跨帧正则化，实现时间一致的局部重建和渲染。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中，GaVS优于现有2D和2.5D方法，用户研究也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: GaVS通过3D基础方法显著提升了视频稳定的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted
shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing
approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues
(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that
degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video
stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'
paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict
Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view
dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to
produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to
render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid
frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with
3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene
dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to
state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics
and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably
better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.

*Xue Wen Tan,Stanley Kok*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: TinyXRA是一个轻量级、可解释的基于Transformer的模型，用于从公司10-K报告中自动评估风险，结合了偏度、峰度和Sortino比率，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评估方法仅依赖超额回报的标准差，无法区分上行和下行风险，需要更全面的方法。

Method: 使用TinyBERT编码器处理长文档，结合动态注意力词云机制和三元组损失进行风险分类。

Result: 在2013-2024年的数据集上，TinyXRA实现了最先进的预测准确性，并提供透明解释。

Conclusion: TinyXRA在轻量化和解释性方面表现优异，具有实际应用潜力，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing
critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable
Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model
that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work
that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for
the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and
downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio
for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to
efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic,
attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization
while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable
deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing
capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for
production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet
loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches
in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk
differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across
seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent
and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively
by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and
qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with
findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了6G网络中多模态集成感知与通信（ISAC）的必要性，分析了其关键挑战，并提出了三种架构范式（F-MAC、I-MAC、R-MAC）及支持技术（如AI大模型、语义通信），通过案例验证了F-MAC方案在感知精度上的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模态ISAC系统在6G应用需求下表现受限，无法全面表征环境特征，因此需要转向多模态ISAC。

Method: 提出三种多模态ISAC架构范式（F-MAC、I-MAC、R-MAC），并结合AI大模型、语义通信等技术解决数据融合、通信开销和系统设计问题。

Result: F-MAC方案在案例研究中显示，相比传统单模态ISAC，感知精度提升约80%。

Conclusion: 多模态ISAC是6G网络发展的关键方向，未来需进一步解决开放性问题。

Abstract: The evolution towards 6G networks requires the intelligent integration of
communication and sensing capabilities to support diverse and complex
applications, such as autonomous driving and immersive services. However,
existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely
on single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited
representation of environmental features and significant performance
bottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation
motivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this
article, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC,
including the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication
overhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable
system architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as
large AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold
promise for addressing these challenges. To operationalize these technologies,
we zoom into three architectural paradigms: fusion-based multimodal ISAC
(F-MAC), interaction-based multimodal ISAC (I-MAC), and relay-based multimodal
ISAC (R-MAC), each tailored to organize devices and modalities for efficient
collaboration in different scenarios. Thereafter, a case study is presented
based on the F-MAC scheme, demonstrating that the scheme achieves more
comprehensive sensing and improves sensing accuracy by approximately 80%
compared to conventional single-modal ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss several
open issues to be addressed in the future.

Conclusion: 为下一代弹性原生和智能无线系统奠定了基础，并提供了发展路线图。

Abstract: Just like power, water, and transportation systems, wireless networks are a
crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions
continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient. This requires them to
withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled
disturbances and cascading failures. Unlike robustness and reliability,
resilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably
happen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to
favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks
that can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time
adaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active
preparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about
potential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of
resilience. This article will first disambiguate resilience from reliability
and robustness, before delving into key mathematical foundations of resilience
grounded in abstraction, compositionality and emergence. Subsequently, we focus
our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the
unique characteristics of resilience, as well as their applications through a
comprehensive set of use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to
establish a unified foundation for understanding, modeling, and engineering
resilience in wireless communication systems, while laying a roadmap for the
next-generation of resilient-native and intelligent wireless systems.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Everything (IoX) and Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) has given rise to a transformative paradigm aimed at
addressing critical bottlenecks across sensing, network, and application layers
in Cyber-Physical-Social Thinking (CPST) ecosystems. In this survey, we provide
a systematic and comprehensive review of AGI-enhanced IoX research, focusing on
three key components: sensing-layer data management, network-layer protocol
optimization, and application-layer decision-making frameworks. Specifically,
this survey explores how AGI can mitigate IoX bottlenecks challenges by
leveraging adaptive sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and selective attention
mechanisms at the sensing layer, while resolving network-layer issues such as
protocol heterogeneity and dynamic spectrum management, neuro-symbolic
reasoning, active inference, and causal reasoning, Furthermore, the survey
examines AGI-enabled frameworks for managing identity and relationship
explosion. Key findings suggest that AGI-driven strategies, such as adaptive
sensor fusion, edge preprocessing, and semantic modeling, offer novel solutions
to sensing-layer data overload, network-layer protocol heterogeneity, and
application-layer identity explosion. The survey underscores the importance of
cross-layer integration, quantum-enabled communication, and ethical governance
frameworks for future AGI-enabled IoX systems. Finally, the survey identifies
unresolved challenges, such as computational requirements, scalability, and
real-world validation, calling for further research to fully realize AGI's
potential in addressing IoX bottlenecks. we believe AGI-enhanced IoX is
emerging as a critical research field at the intersection of interconnected

Result: 在3500 MHz载频的New Radio网络中，离线RL方法比基于规则的MRO表现更好，提升达7%。

Conclusion: 离线强化学习方法在MRO优化中表现优越，且能灵活适应不同目标函数。

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm
and study the possibility of learning the optimal Cell Individual Offset tuning
using offline Reinforcement Learning. Such methods make use of collected
offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We
adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as
a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy
for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input
features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used.
Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on
a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable
cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up
to 7% improvement. Furthermore, offline-RL can be trained for diverse objective
functions using the same available dataset, thus offering operational
flexibility compared to rule-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小蜂窝网络中用户依赖计算密集型服务，云端访问导致高延迟，而边缘计算资源有限，需优化服务部署策略。

Method: 将服务需求建模为服务属性的线性函数，服务部署任务建模为线性多臂老虎机问题，提出分布式自适应多智能体BAI算法。

Result: 仿真显示算法能以所需置信度识别最优服务，学习轮次随SBS数量比例减少，实现近最优加速。

Conclusion: 算法在理论分析和仿真中均表现良好，适用于动态网络条件下的服务部署优化。

Abstract: As users in small cell networks increasingly rely on computation-intensive
services, cloud-based access often results in high latency. Multi-access edge
computing (MEC) mitigates this by bringing computational resources closer to
end users, with small base stations (SBSs) serving as edge servers to enable
low-latency service delivery. However, limited edge capacity makes it
challenging to decide which services to deploy locally versus in the cloud,
especially under unknown service demand and dynamic network conditions. To
tackle this problem, we model service demand as a linear function of service
attributes and formulate the service placement task as a linear bandit problem,
where SBSs act as agents and services as arms. The goal is to identify the
service that, when placed at the edge, offers the greatest reduction in total
user delay compared to cloud deployment. We propose a distributed and adaptive
multi-agent best-arm identification (BAI) algorithm under a fixed-confidence
setting, where SBSs collaborate to accelerate learning. Simulations show that
our algorithm identifies the optimal service with the desired confidence and
achieves near-optimal speedup, as the number of learning rounds decreases
proportionally with the number of SBSs. We also provide theoretical analysis of
the algorithm's sample complexity and communication overhead.

TL;DR: Geminet是一个轻量级、可扩展的基于机器学习的流量工程框架，能够处理拓扑变化，显著降低计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的流量工程方案无法处理拓扑变化或存在扩展性问题，Geminet旨在解决这些限制。

Method: Geminet通过解耦神经网络与拓扑结构，学习基于梯度下降的调整过程，并将优化从路径级转移到边级双变量，减少内存消耗。

Result: Geminet在WAN和数据中心数据集上表现出色，神经网络大小仅为现有方案的0.04%至7%，内存消耗低于10 GiB，收敛速度比HARP快5.45倍。

Conclusion: Geminet展示了在大规模部署中的潜力，兼具高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE),
leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by
optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they
either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to
excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can
handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a
methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an
iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of
gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related
quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to
edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact
that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center
datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural
network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology
variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,
without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies,
Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the
80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence
speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.

Result: NetNomos在多样网络数据集中学习所有基准规则，效率远超基线方法，并在多个案例中展示了其应用价值。

Conclusion: NetNomos为网络数据规则提取提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols,
design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay
must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic
constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the
brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic
understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of
reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches
yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.
  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and
introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from
raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely
challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and
passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos
addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint
specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from
superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial
search space.
  Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all
benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data
points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than
25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies,
we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven
synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their
generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be
used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for
telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.

Motivation: 探讨如何高效估计矩阵函数的迹，特别是通过多项式近似和Krylov子空间方法，以减少计算成本。

Method: 使用Hutchinson方法和Block Krylov技术，通过多项式近似分析Krylov步数的上界，并推导迹估计的查询下界。

Result: 为特定函数（如$A^{-1/2}$和$A^{-1}$）提供了Krylov步数的理论上界，并针对Wishart矩阵的迹估计提出了查询下界。

Conclusion: 揭示了Block Krylov方法与多项式近似之间的联系，明确了迹估计的总成本与多项式近似和信息需求的基本限制之间的关系。

Abstract: This paper studies theoretical lower bounds for estimating the trace of a
matrix function, $\text{tr}(f(A))$, focusing on methods that use Hutchinson's
method along with Block Krylov techniques. These methods work by approximating
matrix-vector products like $f(A)V$ using a Block Krylov subspace. This is
closely related to approximating functions with polynomials. We derive
theoretical upper bounds on how many Krylov steps are needed for functions such
as $A^{-1/2}$ and $A^{-1}$ by analyzing the upper bounds from the polynomial
approximation of their scalar equivalent. In addition, we also develop lower
limits on the number of queries needed for trace estimation, specifically for
$\text{tr}(W^{-p})$ where $W$ is a Wishart matrix. Our study clarifies the
connection between the number of steps in Block Krylov methods and the degree
of the polynomial used for approximation. This links the total cost of trace
estimation to basic limits in polynomial approximation and how much information
is needed for the computation.

Result: 证明了许多常见非可分离非线性满足BCP条件，状态演化在非高斯数据下仍适用。

Conclusion: 非可分离AMP算法的状态演化具有普适性，适用于更广泛的数据分布。

Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including
Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent,
and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning
dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities
have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy
a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution.
However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have
largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP
algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial
non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their
representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for
matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of
BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal
guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable
non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral
denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with
generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP
algorithms employing these non-linearities.

Conclusion: 论文为ATE分布混合体的身份测试和采样提供了有效工具，扩展了相关领域的研究成果。

Abstract: Certain tasks in high-dimensional statistics become easier when the
underlying distribution satisfies a local-to-global property called approximate
tensorization of entropy (ATE). For example, the Glauber dynamics Markov chain
of an ATE distribution mixes fast and can produce approximate samples in a
small amount of time, since such a distribution satisfies a modified
log-Sobolev inequality. Moreover, identity-testing for an ATE distribution
requires few samples if the tester is given coordinate conditional access to
the unknown distribution, as shown by Blanca, Chen, \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, and
Vigoda (COLT 2023).
  A natural class of distributions that do not satisfy ATE consists of mixtures
of (few) distributions that do satisfy ATE. We study the complexity of
identity-testing and sampling for these distributions. Our main results are the
following:
  1. We show fast mixing of Glauber dynamics from a data-based initialization,

### [584] [Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22555)
*Callum Duffy,Marcin Jastrzebski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了量子机器学习中的频谱偏差现象，特别是在参数化量子电路中，发现频谱偏差源于傅里叶系数的冗余性，且梯度大小与冗余性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子机器学习中频谱偏差的成因及其对训练的影响。

Method: 利用参数化量子电路的傅里叶级数表示，分析傅里叶系数的冗余性及其梯度行为，并通过三种编码方案进行实证研究。

Result: 发现傅里叶系数的冗余性与其梯度大小强相关，且冗余性高的电路对参数扰动更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 设计选择（如参数初始化规模和纠缠结构）显著影响量子电路学习傅里叶级数的能力，大初始化和低纠缠方案会减缓收敛。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum
machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit
low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than
high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence.
We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs).
Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that
spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier
coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the
model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding
scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find
that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training
strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further
demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit
increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the
corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability
of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and
entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement
schemes tend to slow convergence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于低秩块张量链分解的量子态层析方法，解决了传统方法因参数指数增长导致的不实用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子态层析（QST）是评估量子设备性能的关键技术，但传统方法因参数指数增长而变得不实用。

Method: 采用低秩块张量链分解参数化量子态，证明该方法在内存和计算上均高效。

Result: 适用于包括纯态、近纯态和哈密顿量基态在内的广泛量子态。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效量子态层析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the
state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing
the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground
states of Hamiltonians.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SQUASH的电路级攻击，通过插入SWAP门破坏混合量子神经网络的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示混合量子神经网络在电路级攻击下的脆弱性，强调需要更鲁棒的架构。

Method: 在受害网络的变分量子电路中插入SWAP门，导致量子比特错位和状态演化中断。

Result: 非目标攻击降低分类准确率高达74.08%，目标攻击降低目标类准确率高达79.78%。

Conclusion: SQUASH攻击暴露了HQNN的关键漏洞，需设计更抗攻击的架构。

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Result: WELAI展示了在下一代无线系统中实现自适应、鲁棒和自主的潜力。

Conclusion: WELAI为无线系统提供了一种新的研究方向，有望实现更高效的网络优化和性能提升。

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for
future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network
optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook
crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on
offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless
dynamics and non-stationary environments. Furthermore, these models often lack
the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a
fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving
from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges
faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system
structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in
next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research
directions for realizing adaptive, robust, and autonomous wireless systems.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: 论文发现单细胞扰动响应模型的性能常被简单预测数据集均值超越，原因是控制参考的delta和未加权误差指标存在度量偏差。作者提出DEG感知的加权指标和基线校准方法，改进了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示单细胞扰动响应模型性能异常的原因，并提出改进方法以更准确评估模型。

Method: 通过大规模模拟和真实数据集分析，提出加权均方误差（WMSE）和加权delta R²（R²_w(Δ)）指标，并引入正负性能基线。

Result: 改进后的指标使均值基线性能降至零，同时正确奖励真实预测器；使用WMSE作为损失函数减少了模式崩溃并提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的DEG感知加权指标和基线校准方法能更准确地评估和优化单细胞扰动响应模型。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response
are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this
anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error
metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological
signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of
two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not
genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We
introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted
mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(\Delta)$) with
respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high
sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines
to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to
null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we
show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves
model performance.

Result: SABRE-FL在五个数据集上表现优于基线方法，显著降低后门攻击成功率，同时保持干净输入的准确性。

Conclusion: 联邦提示学习需要更强的鲁棒性，SABRE-FL为未来系统提供了有效的防御方案。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and
privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP
across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup
remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor
attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients
inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the
global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while
still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this
vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters
poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained
offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client
data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both
theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably
identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse
datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by
significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy,
demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust
prompt learning in future federated systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VERA的变分推理框架，用于黑盒越狱攻击，通过训练小型攻击LLM来生成多样化的对抗提示，无需重新优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖遗传算法和手动优化的提示池，无法全面评估模型漏洞，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: VERA将黑盒越狱问题转化为变分推理问题，训练攻击LLM以近似目标LLM的对抗提示后验分布。

Result: 实验表明，VERA在多种目标LLM上表现优异，验证了概率推理在对抗提示生成中的价值。

Conclusion: VERA提供了一种高效且全面的黑盒越狱方法，为模型漏洞评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

Motivation: 现有自主网络安全防御（ACD）系统假设网络动态是静态的，但在实际中网络拓扑会因攻击、防御行动或系统故障而变化，导致适应性不足。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但目标是提升防御代理在动态环境中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通用自主网络安全防御（GACD）是解决现有系统局限性的潜在方向。

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

TL;DR: UniGuard是一个统一的在线检测框架，能够同时检测对抗样本和后门攻击，通过分析输入在深度学习模型中的传播轨迹差异来实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本（AE）和后门攻击都会影响模型的推理阶段，因此可以在运行时通过在线检测同时解决这两种攻击。

Method: UniGuard将传播轨迹视为时间序列信号，利用LSTM和频谱变换放大对抗样本与良性样本轨迹的差异。

Result: UniGuard在多种模态（图像、文本、音频）和任务（分类、回归）中表现出高效性和有效性，优于现有方法（如ContraNet和TED）。

Conclusion: UniGuard是首个能够统一检测对抗样本和后门攻击的框架，性能优于现有针对单一攻击的先进方法。

Abstract: The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable
of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.
UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have
to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them
simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial
input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in
backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign
sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.
The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of
its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be
fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due
to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation
trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation
to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are
subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness
have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and
audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model
architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks,
including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to
SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED
(IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently
demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's
strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of
attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.

Method: 使用前向可计算的分数结合KL惩罚和奖励偏移的轻量级代理，通过“排序-求和-停止”扫描快速生成短后缀。

Result: 攻击成功率从基线提升至80-100%，且后缀适用于不同规模的模型和未见过的提示。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效，还揭示了安全调整对模型内部表示的影响，为对齐研究提供了轻量级工具。

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

Result: 在10次查询内，MetaCipher对非推理型LLM的攻击成功率达92%，对推理型LLM达74%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaCipher具有长期鲁棒性和适应性，能够有效应对不断升级的安全措施。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to
increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based
attacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly
effective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret
encrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on
keyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to
defend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or
decode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel
obfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement
learning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses
optimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances
jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim
LLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design,
supporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial
strategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of
cipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries,
MetaCipher achieves over 92\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard
malicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and
over 74\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing
obfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term
robustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than
prior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.

Abstract: In the current paradigm of digital personalized services, the centralized
management of personal data raises significant privacy concerns, security
vulnerabilities, and diminished individual autonomy over sensitive information.
Despite their efficiency, traditional centralized architectures frequently fail
to satisfy rigorous privacy requirements and expose users to data breaches and
unauthorized access risks. This pressing challenge calls for a fundamental
paradigm shift in methodologies for collecting, storing, and utilizing personal

  This paper introduces a novel decentralized, privacy-preserving architecture
that handles heterogeneous personal information, ranging from educational
credentials to health records and financial data. Unlike traditional models,
our system grants users complete data ownership and control, allowing them to
selectively share information without compromising privacy. The architecture's
foundation comprises advanced privacy-enhancing technologies, including secure
enclaves and federated learning, enabling secure computation, verification, and
data sharing. The system supports diverse functionalities, including local
computation, model training, and privacy-preserving data sharing, while
ensuring data credibility and robust user privacy.

Abstract: With current advancement in hybermedia knowledges, the privacy of digital
information has developed a critical problem. To overawed the susceptibilities
of present security protocols, scholars tend to focus mainly on efforts on
alternation of current protocols. Over past decade, various proposed encoding
models have been shown insecurity, leading to main threats against significant
data. Utilizing the suitable encryption model is very vital means of guard
against various such, but algorithm is selected based on the dependency of data
which need to be secured. Moreover, testing potentiality of the security
assessment one by one to identify the best choice can take a vital time for
processing. For faster and precisive identification of assessment algorithm, we
suggest a security phase exposure model for cipher encryption technique by
invoking Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work, we form a dataset using
usual security components like contrast, homogeneity. To overcome the
uncertainty in analysing the security and lack of ability of processing data to
a risk assessment mechanism. To overcome with such complications, this paper
proposes an assessment model for security issues using fuzzy evidential
reasoning (ER) approaches. Significantly, the model can be utilised to process
and assemble risk assessment data on various aspects in systematic ways. To
estimate the performance of our framework, we have various analyses like,

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的LLM-agent生态系统威胁模型，涵盖输入操纵、模型妥协、系统与隐私攻击及协议漏洞四大领域，并评估了现有防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM-agent生态系统的快速发展，插件和协议的激增导致安全机制滞后，亟需全面的威胁模型来指导防御设计。

Method: 论文构建了一个端到端的威胁模型，分类整理了30多种攻击技术，并评估了每种攻击的现实可行性和现有防御措施。

Result: 提出了四大威胁领域的具体攻击场景和防御评估，并指出了未来研究方向，如动态信任管理和加密溯源跟踪。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计鲁棒的防御机制和建立LLM-agent工作流的最佳实践提供了全面参考。

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with structured
function-calling interfaces have dramatically expanded capabilities for
real-time data retrieval, complex computation, and multi-step orchestration.
Yet, the explosive proliferation of plugins, connectors, and inter-agent
protocols has outpaced discovery mechanisms and security practices, resulting
in brittle integrations vulnerable to diverse threats. In this survey, we
introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems,
spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary
capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack
techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains:
Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal
adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level
backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies),
System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership
inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol
Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent
Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess
real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat
taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such
as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic
provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and
achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments. Our work
provides a comprehensive reference to guide the design of robust defense
mechanisms and establish best practices for resilient LLM-agent workflows.

TL;DR: MH-AutoML是一个针对Android恶意软件检测的领域特定AutoML框架，解决了现有AutoML解决方案在透明度、可解释性和实验追踪方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML解决方案多为黑盒系统，缺乏透明度和可解释性，难以满足网络安全需求。

Method: MH-AutoML自动化了整个机器学习流程，包括数据预处理、特征工程、算法选择和超参数调优，并增加了可解释性、调试和实验追踪功能。

Result: MH-AutoML在召回率上优于七种主流AutoML框架，同时保持计算效率，并提供更高的透明度和控制。

Conclusion: MH-AutoML在性能和可解释性方面表现优异，适合网络安全应用。

Abstract: Malware detection in Android systems requires both cybersecurity expertise
and machine learning (ML) techniques. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has
emerged as an approach to simplify ML development by reducing the need for
specialized knowledge. However, current AutoML solutions typically operate as
black-box systems with limited transparency, interpretability, and experiment
traceability. To address these limitations, we present MH-AutoML, a
domain-specific framework for Android malware detection. MH-AutoML automates
the entire ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering,
algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The framework incorporates
capabilities for interpretability, debugging, and experiment tracking that are
often missing in general-purpose solutions. In this study, we compare MH-AutoML
against seven established AutoML frameworks: Auto-Sklearn, AutoGluon, TPOT,
HyperGBM, Auto-PyTorch, LightAutoML, and MLJAR. Results show that MH-AutoML
achieves better recall rates while providing more transparency and control. The
framework maintains computational efficiency comparable to other solutions,
making it suitable for cybersecurity applications where both performance and
explainability matter.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中安全聚合导致的恶意行为检测和贡献评估困难问题。

Method: 结合QI和FedGT的方法，整合两者的优势。

Result: 实验表明，结合方法性能优于单独使用QI或FedGT。

Conclusion: 通过整合QI和FedGT，实现了更高效的联邦学习安全性和贡献评估。

Abstract: Federated learning with secure aggregation enables private and collaborative
learning from decentralised data without leaking sensitive client information.
However, secure aggregation also complicates the detection of malicious client
behaviour and the evaluation of individual client contributions to the
learning. To address these challenges, QI (Pejo et al.) and FedGT (Xhemrishi et
al.) were proposed for contribution evaluation (CE) and misbehaviour detection
(MD), respectively. QI, however, lacks adequate MD accuracy due to its reliance
on the random selection of clients in each training round, while FedGT lacks
the CE ability. In this work, we combine the strengths of QI and FedGT to
achieve both robust MD and accurate CE. Our experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to using either method independently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在敏感领域的广泛应用，传统数据隐私措施无法保护隐含、上下文或可推断的信息（即语义隐私），因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 通过分类关键攻击向量，评估现有防御措施（如差分隐私、嵌入加密、边缘计算和遗忘技术）的效果。

Result: 分析揭示了语义层面保护的关键漏洞，尤其是在上下文推断和潜在表示泄露方面。

Conclusion: 论文总结了开放挑战，包括量化语义泄露、保护多模态输入、平衡去标识与生成质量，以及确保隐私执行的透明度，旨在为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting
information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as
semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a
lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across
input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We
categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as
differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning,
address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level
protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation
leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying
semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification
with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This
work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware
privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于真值表和Transformer架构的MBA反混淆框架（gMBA），通过引入语义信息显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBA混淆被广泛用于恶意软件中，传统方法忽视其内部语义信息，导致反混淆效果不佳。

Method: 提出真值表作为语义表示，并设计了一个基于Transformer的Seq2Seq框架（gMBA），结合语义指导进行反混淆。

Result: 实验表明，引入语义信息显著提升了反混淆性能。

Conclusion: 内部语义信息对恢复混淆代码至原始形式至关重要，gMBA框架具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation protects intellectual property by
converting programs into forms that are more complex to analyze. However, MBA
has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and
cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods
often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their
internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table,
which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an
expression's behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table
is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all
possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided
MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural
encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression
semantics significantly improves performance and highlights the importance of
internal semantic expressions in recovering obfuscated code to its original
form.

Motivation: 由于缺乏公开的真实API数据，研究隐私保护广告API的隐私属性受到阻碍。

Result: 生成了一个差分隐私保护的合成数据集，公开供外部研究使用。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了隐私保护广告API的透明性研究。

Abstract: The analysis of the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs is an
area of research that has received strong interest from academics, industry,
and regulators. Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is
hindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of
the privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset
consisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the
general release of such data to the public.
  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API
outputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and
provide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads
APIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a
methodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches
the re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of
differential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of
private user information from this release.
  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of
differentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over
time. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces
and optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.
Finally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.
  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset
obtained by this methodology. We hope this will enable external researchers to
analyze the API in-depth and replicate prior and future work on a realistic
large-scale dataset. We believe that this work will contribute to fostering
transparency regarding the privacy properties of Privacy-Preserving Ads APIs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的恶意软件分类方法，通过构建一个同时标注类型和家族的新型数据集，并利用静态分析提取特征，实现了高精度的分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决恶意软件分类的挑战，尤其是缺乏同时标注类型和家族的数据集，以支持更细粒度的分类研究。

Method: 从多个来源收集原始二进制文件，标注类型和家族信息，构建统一特征提取管道，基于静态分析提取PE头特征，使用多种机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 在二进制分类任务中，Random Forest和XGBoost达到98.5%和98.98%的准确率；在有限数据条件下仍表现优异；多类分类任务中，SVM和Random Forest/XGBoost分别达到81.1%和73.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究表明同时标注类型和家族的数据集能实现更细粒度的分类，为未来恶意软件检测研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of malware classification using machine
learning by developing a novel dataset labeled at both the malware type and
family levels. Raw binaries were collected from sources such as VirusShare, VX
Underground, and MalwareBazaar, and subsequently labeled with family
information parsed from binary names and type-level labels integrated from
ClarAVy. The dataset includes 14 malware types and 17 malware families, and was
processed using a unified feature extraction pipeline based on static analysis,
particularly extracting features from Portable Executable headers, to support
advanced classification tasks. The evaluation was focused on three key
classification tasks. In the binary classification of malware versus benign
samples, Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high accuracy on the full datasets,
reaching 98.5% for type-based detection and 98.98% for family-based detection.
When using truncated datasets of 1,000 samples to assess performance under
limited data conditions, both models still performed strongly, achieving 97.6%
for type-based detection and 98.66% for family-based detection. For interclass
classification, which distinguishes between malware types or families, the
models reached up to 97.5% accuracy on type-level tasks and up to 93.7% on
family-level tasks. In the multiclass classification setting, which assigns
samples to the correct type or family, SVM achieved 81.1% accuracy on type
labels, while Random Forest and XGBoost reached approximately 73.4% on family
labels. The results highlight practical trade-offs between accuracy and
computational cost, and demonstrate that labeling at both the type and family
levels enables more fine-grained and insightful malware classification. The
work establishes a robust foundation for future research on advanced malware
detection and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定预算下最佳治疗方案选择的问题，旨在高效识别预期效果最佳的治疗方案。

Method: 采用两阶段自适应实验设计：第一阶段均匀分配治疗以剔除次优方案并估计方差；第二阶段按方差比例分配；最后选择样本均值最高的方案。

Result: 证明该设计在简单遗憾下同时达到渐近极小极大和贝叶斯最优性，上下界匹配。

Conclusion: 该实验设计无需额外调参即可达到效率极限，适用于多种目标。

Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice,
also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive
procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a
treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to
efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the
highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation
phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we
allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate
clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we
allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first
stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the
treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest
sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this
single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for
the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact
constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency
limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.

Motivation: 现有自主数据库平台功能有限，仍需人工干预，GaussMaster旨在通过LLM技术实现全面自动化维护。

Method: GaussMaster通过分析数百个指标和日志，采用Tree-of-thought方法定位问题根源，并调用工具解决问题。

Result: 在银行业等实际场景中，GaussMaster成功实现了34种数据库维护场景的零人工干预。

Conclusion: GaussMaster展示了在数据库维护任务中的显著改进，为全面自动化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs
shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment,
diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and
customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an
effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous
database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing
single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual
intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.
GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based
database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to
assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide
comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit
abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire
maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of
metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,
and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully
implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,
where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance
scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks
with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.

Abstract: Spiders use their webs as multifunctional tools that enable capturing and
localizing prey and more general environmental sensing through vibrations.
Inspired by their biological function, we present a spider web-inspired optical
waveguide system for resilient impulse detection and localization. The
structure consists of six clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) waveguides
arranged radially and interconnected by a spiral TPU thread, mimicking orb
spider webs. Light transmission losses, induced by vibrations, are measured via
coupled LEDs and photo-diodes, allowing real-time detection. We systematically
characterize individual waveguides, analyzing key parameters such as tension,
impulse position, and break angle to optimize vibrational response. The
complete system is validated through controlled experiments, revealing a 5 ms
propagation delay in vibration transfer between adjacent radii, enhancing
localization capabilities. We demonstrate a robust impulse detection and
localization algorithm leveraging time delay analysis, achieving reliable event
identification even in cases of sensor failure. This study highlights the
potential of bioinspired optical waveguide structures for adaptive sensing,
with applications in soft robotics, structural monitoring, and environmental
sensing.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless
systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA
system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised
learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS
beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes
BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which
allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active
beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To
handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and
the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training
enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves
99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and
it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.

Motivation: 实现家庭环境中连续、非侵入性的胎儿健康监测，克服干纺织电极带来的噪声和运动伪影问题。

Method: 使用复杂值去噪网络（Complex UNet）处理频谱图的实部和虚部，结合模拟和真实数据验证。

Result: 新方法在fECG提取和R峰检测上达到最新技术水平，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功从单通道干纺织电极记录中提取fECG，为非侵入性家庭胎儿监测提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising
potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a
promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments.
Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable
and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup
presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which
complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from
single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI
techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings,
including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo
recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure
the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based
on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches
that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and
imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and
preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against
traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in
terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our
suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate
extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the
first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using
dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully
non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.

Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating
vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life
has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these
estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data
used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory
environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are
assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of
researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made
during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111
participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the
fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times
worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep
learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising
solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for
estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error
in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that
regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and
RR.

Conclusion: 该开源框架为国家级地下水监测网络提供了可扩展的机器学习解决方案，支持更灵活的数据驱动水资源管理。

Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies
worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data,
computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We
develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories
using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes
processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach
integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and
automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations.
Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $>$ 3,440,000 observations from
1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation
data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations
demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation
decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national
groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着老年人口增长，跌倒检测对独立生活至关重要，但现有方法面临数据稀缺和隐私问题。

Method: 设计了基于UWB雷达传感器的服务架构，结合FD-GPT模型进行数据增强，并开发了数据集收集协议。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在区分跌倒事件和日常活动时达到90.72%的准确率和89.33%的精确率。

Conclusion: FDaaS框架在隐私保护和数据稀缺问题上表现优异，为老年人提供了可靠的跌倒检测服务。

Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population,
projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050. However, existing methods often face
data scarcity challenges or compromise privacy. We propose a novel IoT-based
Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework to assist the elderly in living
independently and safely by accurately detecting falls. We design a
service-oriented architecture that leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors
as an IoT health-sensing service, ensuring privacy and minimal intrusion. We
address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques.
We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily
activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully
mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models
using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72%
accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular
activities of daily living.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building
infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated
industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant
systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.
This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data
analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network
where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this
context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data
analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low
resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data
retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office
by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research
motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables
that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for
energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of
hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables
with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were
performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed
the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental
variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed
methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak
correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG诊断中动态特征的捕捉常被简单性偏差（SB）影响，导致模型忽略细微但关键的临床线索。自监督学习（SSL）被发现能缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出时间-频率感知滤波器捕捉ECG信号的动态特征，并结合多粒度原型重建进行双域表示学习。

Result: 在六个ECG数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减轻SB并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习为ECG分析中的简单性偏差提供了有效解决方案，且方法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic
characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform
deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised
ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking
fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity
Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but
informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence
of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while
simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate
it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL
paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)
Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features
reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,
Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation
learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG
analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million
recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream
tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces
SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released
publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非线性动力学和熵度量的定量框架，用于分类STN内外的神经活动，支持DBS手术中的实时决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DBS手术中STN定位依赖主观信号特征解释，需更客观的方法。

Method: 预处理MER数据，提取非线性、熵和复发量化特征，训练多种分类器，评估性能。

Result: 熵和非线性特征组合效果最佳，Extra Trees分类器表现最优（F1=0.902，ROC AUC=0.887）。

Conclusion: 非线性与熵特征可有效支持DBS手术中的实时数据驱动决策。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with
Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich
electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current
localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal
features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages
nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity
recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were
preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and
labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence
quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from
each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination
of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by
statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features
yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier
emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and
ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed
robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the
potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time,
data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大规模预训练范式（如自监督学习）下EEG数据归一化策略的优化问题，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 系统评估归一化粒度（记录级别vs窗口级别）和范围（跨通道vs通道内）对监督任务（年龄和性别预测）和自监督任务（对比预测编码）的影响。

Result: 监督任务中窗口级别通道内归一化效果最佳，而自监督任务中窗口级别跨通道或最小归一化更有效。

Conclusion: 归一化策略需根据任务类型定制，通用策略无法适用于所有学习场景，为EEG深度学习提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the
preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of
large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL)
introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from
supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new
questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In
this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity
(recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on
both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive
Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836
subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal
normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms.
Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in
supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window
level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of
task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a
universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our
findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning
pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.

Result: 在六名健康受试者上的实验表明，PENN在RMSE和R²指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PENN在保持生理一致性的同时实现了高精度运动估计，适用于康复机器人和辅助技术。

Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography
(sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in
rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing
sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific
musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely
data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a
novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK
forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving
physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN
employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a
lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to
robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is
designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that
PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square
error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险的技能评估需要能够解码认知和运动过程并具有跨任务、个体和实验环境泛化能力的模型。现有方法通常任务特定、预处理复杂且对新条件鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用自监督学习训练基于Transformer的模型，处理最小预处理的fNIRS信号，并通过轻量适配器模块实现对新任务的泛化。

Result: 模型在多个任务中分类准确率超过88%，Matthews相关系数超过0.91，对新任务（如环甲膜切开术）的AUC超过87%。

Conclusion: 该模型在跨程序技能评估中表现出色，通过新型通道注意力机制实现了可解释性，为动态认知状态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires
models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also
generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior
work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are
often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to
new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable
transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals
for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised
learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation
(ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all
tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It
generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer
than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter
module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a
novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that
identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through
ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases
and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into
dynamic cognitive states.

Result: 在基准数据集上实现跨受试者步态解码的优异性能，并具备无需显式相位监督的强相位检测能力。

Conclusion: 关系域学习为BCI的可扩展、无目标部署提供了潜力。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for
advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent
recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal,
phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject
variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a
domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured
contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The
proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic
alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait
reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and
maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization,
during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns
session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on
inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction
for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior
performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally,
it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase
supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of
relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of
BCIs.

Motivation: 设计一种低复杂度、高性能的目标方向值融合方法，减少对先验知识的依赖，适用于未来6G无线网络的大规模H$^2$AD结构。

Method: 1. 提出CRLB-ratio-WF方法，通过天线数倒数近似子阵列的逆CRLB，避免实时CRLB计算；2. 构建MBDNN，利用多子阵列的候选角度增强DOA感知，并通过共享回归模块消除伪解。

Result: CRLB-ratio-WF方法性能接近基于CRLB的方法，同时显著减少对先验知识的依赖；MBDNN在低信噪比（SNR=-15dB）下估计精度提升一个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提方法在减少复杂度和先验知识依赖的同时，保持了高性能，MBDNN在低SNR下表现尤为突出。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential
technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a
challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of
target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of
prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse
CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time
CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while
preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network
(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by
leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific
branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively
eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that
the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable
to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior
knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR
ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in
estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.

Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design,
characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its
traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing
integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine
learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical
framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity
functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that
have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation:
proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient
computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout
cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable
operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity
Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain
mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire
pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose
differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic
differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural
network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end
optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with
modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and
demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This
work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying
modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical
radar signal processing with automatic differentiation frameworks.

Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important
predictors of health outcomes. While MRI offers a valuable modality for such
assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains
challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle
segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various
anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160
patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020)
were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The
model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common
sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and
abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise,
achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully
automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse
settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible
research into the relationship between musculature and health.

Result: HMM显著提升了AAD算法的准确性和响应速度，优于现有后处理方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时和离线场景中均适用，为AAD的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as
electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing
on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can
identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are
often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD
with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of
attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much
less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any
moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD
algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We
further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in
both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as
window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall
performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use
and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.

Result: 发现小带宽参数会导致回报高度异质性，而大带宽参数虽结果一致但风险调整后回报较低。

Conclusion: 建议在股票市场预测中谨慎使用大型线性模型，尤其是在易发生制度变化的场景中。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of posterior drift on out-of-sample
forecasting accuracy in overparametrized machine learning models. We document
the loss in performance when the loadings of the data generating process change
between the training and testing samples. This matters crucially in settings in
which regime changes are likely to occur, for instance, in financial markets.
Applied to equity premium forecasting, our results underline the sensitivity of
a market timing strategy to sub-periods and to the bandwidth parameters that
control the complexity of the model. For the average investor, we find that
focusing on holding periods of 15 years can generate very heterogeneous
returns, especially for small bandwidths. Large bandwidths yield much more
consistent outcomes, but are far less appealing from a risk-adjusted return
standpoint. All in all, our findings tend to recommend cautiousness when
resorting to large linear models for stock market predictions.

Conclusion: 自适应比特分配策略显著提升了SNN的效率和准确性，为解决多比特SNN的资源浪费问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated
research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with
more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to
the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on
the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra
bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit
allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise
allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and
accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and
the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable
through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths
and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle
different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal
lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically
formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may
incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size
renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,
including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and
DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and
computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our
SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit
budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully
open-sourced.

### [630] [Marker Gene Method : Identifying Stable Solutions in a Dynamic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23734)
*Hao Shi,Xi Li,Fangfang Xie*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Marker Gene Method（MGM）的框架，通过动态基准和自适应权重机制解决竞争性协同进化算法（CCEAs）中的不稳定收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性协同进化算法常因复杂动态（如非传递性和红皇后效应）导致不稳定收敛，MGM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MGM利用‘标记基因’作为动态基准，结合自适应权重机制平衡探索与开发，并通过数学证明其在严格竞争博弈框架中形成纳什均衡的强吸引子。

Result: 实验表明，MGM在经典石头剪刀布游戏、ZDT基准测试中显著提升性能，并通过内存池扩展成功解决Shapley偏置博弈问题。

Conclusion: MGM是一个理论严谨且经验验证的框架，显著提升了CCEAs在复杂竞争环境中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex
dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable
convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene
Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene'
as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance
exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs
demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within
the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its
efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D
on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it
successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work
presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that
substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex
competitive environments.

TL;DR: Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS) 是一种高效的两层脉冲神经网络，用于实时、低功耗的边缘端尖峰排序，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口中实时、低功耗且高性能的尖峰排序需求。

Method: 利用局部竞争算法（LCA）进行稀疏编码，结合定制化的脉冲神经元模型，支持多比特尖峰编码。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，NSS 表现优于 WaveClus3 和 PCA+KMeans，F1 分数提高 10%，功耗仅增加 1.65mW。

Conclusion: NSS 是一种高效、无监督的尖峰排序方法，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural
signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key
challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power
spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This
study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer
spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the
Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant
features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to
sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely
unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic
platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling
flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths.
Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift
showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans.
With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with
leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10%
improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting
recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per
inference.

TL;DR: 本研究首次使用3D谱元法（SEM）模拟宽吻海豚头部超声波传播，克服了传统有限元法（FEM）在高频模拟中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FEM在高频模拟中效率低且收敛慢，而SEM具有指数收敛和高效并行计算能力，适合模拟复杂生物声学问题。

Method: 利用CT扫描数据构建海豚头部的六面体网格，模拟平面波和球面波的超声波传播。

Result: SEM在超声波时域建模中表现出高效性，为海豚生物声学研究提供了新工具。

Conclusion: SEM为海洋生物学研究（如回声定位、海洋噪声污染影响等）提供了可扩展的强大工具，对保护海洋哺乳动物听觉系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation
of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)
head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with
high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower
convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel
computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed
hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats
and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's
effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new
avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the
impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing
and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM
provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin
bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding
marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于监督扩散模型（DM）的PET图像重建算法，通过结合PET的Poisson似然模型和扩散模型，显著提升了重建精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的PET重建方法虽然具有泛化优势，但未能显式建模DM先验与噪声测量数据的交互，限制了重建精度。

Method: 提出了一种监督DM算法，强制PET的Poisson似然模型非负性，并适应PET图像的宽强度范围。

Result: 在真实脑PET模型上的实验表明，该方法在多种剂量水平下优于或匹配现有深度学习方法，且能更准确地进行后验采样。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了重建精度和不确定性估计，还可扩展至全3D PET重建，展示了在真实[$^{18}$F]FDG脑PET数据中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced as a regularizing prior
for PET image reconstruction, integrating DMs trained on high-quality PET
images with unsupervised schemes that condition on measured data. While these
approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence
from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the
opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy
measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address
this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our
method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and
accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on
realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a
range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on
training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we
show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than
unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation.
Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and
present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.

improvements in task completion times, usability metrics, and interaction
effectiveness enhanced by LLM-driven voice control. While identifying areas for

Motivation: 探索AI如何通过好奇触发和响应行为激发学生好奇心，并评估其对学习效果的影响。

Method: 采用混合方法设计，11名高中生参与4项任务，通过Wizard-of-Oz范式动态调整AI行为。

Result: 高绩效团队表现出更好的任务完成度和理解深度，AI好奇触发行为与高级问题相关。

Conclusion: AI作为队友和教育者的双重角色能提供适应性反馈，维持学生参与度和认知好奇心。

Abstract: This study examines the impact of an Artificial Intelligence tutor teammate
(AI) on student curiosity-driven engagement and learning effectiveness during
Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) tasks on the Visual Molecular Dynamics
platform. It explores the role of the AI's curiosity-triggering and response
behaviors in stimulating and sustaining student curiosity, affecting the
frequency and complexity of student-initiated questions. The study further
assesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery
curiosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment.
Using a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI
tutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a
mixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students
participated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and
calculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period. Team
performance was evaluated through real-time observation and recordings, whereas
team communication was measured by question complexity and AI's
curiosity-triggering and response behaviors. Cross Recurrence Quantification
Analysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were
linked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior
task completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement. Advanced
questions were associated with AI curiosity-triggering, indicating heightened
engagement and cognitive complexity. CRQA metrics highlighted dynamic
synchronization in student-AI interactions, emphasizing structured yet adaptive
engagement to promote curiosity. These proof-of-concept findings suggest that
the AI's dual role as a teammate and educator indicates its capacity to provide
adaptive feedback, sustaining engagement and epistemic curiosity.

Method: 通过定性研讨会，汇集学者、减害实践者和社区管理者，探讨LLMs的潜力与设计考量。

Conclusion: 强调与专家和PWUD共同设计，开发安全、负责任的LLMs系统，为减害领域提供支持。

Abstract: Access to accurate and actionable harm reduction information can directly
impact the health outcomes of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), yet existing online
channels often fail to meet their diverse and dynamic needs due to limitations
in adaptability, accessibility, and the pervasive impact of stigma. Large
Language Models (LLMs) present a novel opportunity to enhance information
provision, but their application in such a high-stakes domain is under-explored
and presents socio-technical challenges. This paper investigates how LLMs can
be responsibly designed to support the information needs of PWUD. Through a
qualitative workshop involving diverse stakeholder groups (academics, harm
reduction practitioners, and an online community moderator), we explored LLM
capabilities, identified potential use cases, and delineated core design
considerations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can address some existing
information barriers (e.g., by offering responsive, multilingual, and
potentially less stigmatising interactions), their effectiveness is contingent
upon overcoming challenges related to ethical alignment with harm reduction
principles, nuanced contextual understanding, effective communication, and
clearly defined operational boundaries. We articulate design pathways
emphasising collaborative co-design with experts and PWUD to develop LLM
systems that are helpful, safe, and responsibly governed. This work contributes
empirically grounded insights and actionable design considerations for the
responsible development of LLMs as supportive tools within the harm reduction
ecosystem.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI如何通过“softmaxing culture”现象同质化语言和文化，并提出了两种评估文化的关键转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型正在将丰富的语言和文化差异平均化为通用表达，这对文化评估提出了挑战。

Method: 提出从“文化是什么”转向“文化何时出现”的问题，并强调将文化普遍性与特殊性结合。

Result: 建议超越技术要求，采用更复杂的文化视角进行评估。

Conclusion: 文化评估需要更灵活的方法，以应对AI系统中的文化复杂性。

Abstract: AI is flattening culture. Evaluations of "culture" are showing the myriad
ways in which large AI models are homogenizing language and culture, averaging
out rich linguistic differences into generic expressions. I call this
phenomenon "softmaxing culture," and it is one of the fundamental challenges
facing AI evaluations today. Efforts to improve and strengthen evaluations of
culture are central to the project of cultural alignment in large AI systems.
This position paper argues that machine learning (ML) and human-computer
interaction (HCI) approaches to evaluation are limited. I propose two key
shifts. First, instead of asking "what is culture?" at the start of system
evaluations, I propose beginning with the question: "when is culture?" Second,
while I acknowledge the philosophical claim that cultural universals exist, the
challenge is not simply to describe them, but to situate them in relation to
their particulars. Taken together, these conceptual shifts invite evaluation
approaches that move beyond technical requirements, toward perspectives more
responsive to the complexities of culture.

Motivation: EEG信号的多尺度时空结构被现有模型忽视，导致表示和泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入跨尺度时空标记化（CST）和结构化稀疏注意力（SSA），交替堆叠以整合多尺度依赖。

Result: 在11个EEG任务和16个数据集上，CSBrain表现优于任务特定模型和基础模型。

Conclusion: 跨尺度建模是关键归纳偏置，CSBrain为未来脑-AI研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in
cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While
recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified
architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense
modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core
property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task
patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to
slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed
interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and
weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain
foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i)
Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale
features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into
compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which
captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity
while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to
progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks
across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and
foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a
key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future
brain-AI research.

Motivation: 便携式EEG设备（如Muse头带）在移动性上具有优势，但信号的非平稳性限制了数据质量和解码精度。

Method: 提出MuseCogNet框架，结合自监督重建损失（基于平均池化）和监督学习的交叉熵损失，模拟人类注意力机制。

Result: 在公开Muse数据集上显著优于现有方法，为生态场景中的神经认知监测提供了可行路径。

Conclusion: MuseCogNet通过联合学习框架解决了便携性与性能的权衡问题，提升了便携式EEG的实用性。

Abstract: Portable and wearable consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices,
like Muse headbands, offer unprecedented mobility for daily brain-computer
interface (BCI) applications, including cognitive load detection. However, the
exacerbated non-stationarity in portable EEG signals constrains data fidelity
and decoding accuracy, creating a fundamental trade-off between portability and
performance. To mitigate such limitation, we propose MuseCogNet (Muse-based
Cognitive Network), a unified joint learning framework integrating
self-supervised and supervised training paradigms. In particular, we introduce
an EEG-grounded self-supervised reconstruction loss based on average pooling to
capture robust neurophysiological patterns, while cross-entropy loss refines
task-specific cognitive discriminants. This joint learning framework resembles
the bottom-up and top-down attention in humans, enabling MuseCogNet to
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available Muse
dataset and establish an implementable pathway for neurocognitive monitoring in
ecological settings.

Result: 用户研究表明，交互式推理能帮助用户快速识别错误、定制响应并更好地理解模型推理。

Conclusion: 该工作为将用户监督融入LLM推理过程提供了新范式。

Abstract: The output quality of large language models (LLMs) can be improved via
"reasoning": generating segments of chain-of-thought (CoT) content to further
condition the model prior to producing user-facing output. While these chains
contain valuable information, they are verbose and lack explicit organization,
making them tedious to review. Moreover, they lack opportunities for user
feedback, such as to remove unwanted considerations, add desired ones, or
clarify unclear assumptions. We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction
design that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and
enables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in
Hippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain
trade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive
reasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous
generations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and
better understand both model reasoning and model outputs. Our work contributes
to a new paradigm that incorporates user oversight into LLM reasoning
processes.

Conclusion: 提出一个框架和设计模式，以开发增强而非削弱人类自主性的AI系统。

Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of
professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has
examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on
domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within
defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI
decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy:
skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain)
and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant
values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing
empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we
demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential
for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both
immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for
autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical
design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of
defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help
maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This
framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance
rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.

Method: 基于Constructive Alignment理论和Bloom分类法，分析AI对不同层次学习目标的影响，并提出评估方法的调整建议。

Result: 发现教师对AI在评估中的允许程度存在偏见，建议制定统一指南并提供AI工具培训。

Conclusion: 教育评估需适应AI的发展，通过结构化的指南和教师培训实现更公平有效的评估。

Abstract: The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large
Language Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models
are frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current
forms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and
comprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in
Constructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning
objectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom
levels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.
Furthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment
should be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.
  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be
adapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which
lecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a
lecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.
To avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty
level, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that
teaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI
tools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.

Abstract: The global prevalence of dementia is projected to double by 2050,
highlighting the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. This study utilizes
digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes
to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was
trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who
performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial
data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat
maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters
such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model
performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps,
achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more
challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a
less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an
Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity).
These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for
MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized
long-term visual memory task.

deep neural networks to parameterize convex-risk minimization (CVaR/ES) for the
portfolio tail-risk hedging problem. Through comprehensive numerical

*Fiona Xiao Jingyi,Lili Liu*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合结构化经济指标和美联储文本的非结构化信号，提升了联邦基金利率预测的准确性，混合模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测央行政策决策对投资者和决策者至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉前瞻性信号。

Method: 采用多模态框架，结合传统机器学习、Transformer语言模型和深度学习，比较单模态与混合模型。

Result: 混合模型表现最优，XGBoost结合TF-IDF特征达到0.83的测试AUC；FinBERT情感特征对分类效果有限。

Conclusion: 透明结合文本与结构化信号的简单混合模型，在准确性和可解释性上均表现优异。

Abstract: Forecasting central bank policy decisions remains a persistent challenge for
investors, financial institutions, and policymakers due to the wide-reaching
impact of monetary actions. In particular, anticipating shifts in the U.S.
federal funds rate is vital for risk management and trading strategies.
Traditional methods relying only on structured macroeconomic indicators often
fall short in capturing the forward-looking cues embedded in central bank
communications.
  This study examines whether predictive accuracy can be enhanced by
integrating structured data with unstructured textual signals from Federal
Reserve communications. We adopt a multi-modal framework, comparing traditional
machine learning models, transformer-based language models, and deep learning
architectures in both unimodal and hybrid settings.
  Our results show that hybrid models consistently outperform unimodal
baselines. The best performance is achieved by combining TF-IDF features of
FOMC texts with economic indicators in an XGBoost classifier, reaching a test
AUC of 0.83. FinBERT-based sentiment features marginally improve ranking but
perform worse in classification, especially under class imbalance. SHAP
analysis reveals that sparse, interpretable features align more closely with
policy-relevant signals.
  These findings underscore the importance of integrating textual and
structured signals transparently. For monetary policy forecasting, simpler
hybrid models can offer both accuracy and interpretability, delivering
actionable insights for researchers and decision-makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDT是数据驱动的决策支持模型，但对话AI的进步为HDT作为真实的交互式数字个体提供了新可能。

Method: 采用上下文感知记忆检索、神经可塑性启发的巩固和自适应学习机制，构建自然且进化的数字人格。

Result: 系统不仅能根据对话对象复制个体的独特对话风格，还能动态融入个人经历、观点和记忆。

Conclusion: 研究推动了HDT的发展，但也引发隐私、责任和持久数字身份的伦理问题，需确保其负责任和伦理发展。

Abstract: Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have traditionally been conceptualized as
data-driven models designed to support decision-making across various domains.
However, recent advancements in conversational AI open new possibilities for
HDTs to function as authentic, interactive digital counterparts of individuals.
This paper introduces a novel HDT system architecture that integrates large
language models with dynamically updated personal data, enabling it to mirror
an individual's conversational style, memories, and behaviors. To achieve this,
our approach implements context-aware memory retrieval, neural
plasticity-inspired consolidation, and adaptive learning mechanisms, creating a
more natural and evolving digital persona. The resulting system does not only
replicate an individual's unique conversational style depending on who they are
speaking with, but also enriches responses with dynamically captured personal
experiences, opinions, and memories. While this marks a significant step toward
developing authentic virtual counterparts, it also raises critical ethical
concerns regarding privacy, accountability, and the long-term implications of
persistent digital identities. This study contributes to the field of HDTs by
describing our novel system architecture, demonstrating its capabilities, and
discussing future directions and emerging challenges to ensure the responsible
and ethical development of HDTs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种方法，通过双语数据集训练现有语言模型，使其在多语言环境下具备可靠的工具调用能力，并以保加利亚语为例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言模型在非英语语言中工具调用能力不足，存在语言混淆问题，需要一种方法提升其工具使用能力。

Method: 通过继续训练BgGPT系列模型（2.6B、9B、27B参数），使用包含10,035个工具调用示例的双语数据集，支持标准化协议如MCP。

Result: 提出的TUCAN模型在工具调用准确率上比基础模型提升28.75%，同时保持语言理解能力，输出格式更规范。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展工具增强能力到非英语系统提供了实用途径，相关模型和数据集已开源。

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical
language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable
tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art
multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating
the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language
confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a
methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in
any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves
continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a
novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support
standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research
introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to
28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while
preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian
benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready
response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the
verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation
framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.
This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented
capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中高维数据稀疏性问题，同时避免依赖复杂架构或内容数据。

Method: 采用自然语言处理模型的先进策略，优化训练阶段并增强嵌入质量。

Result: 在30%的数据集上排名第二或第三，训练时间平均减少274%，嵌入质量通过相似性表验证。

Conclusion: Interact2Vec在计算资源有限的情况下表现优异，是一种高效的用户和项目嵌入生成模型。

Abstract: Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in
popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues,
such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items
as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading
solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches
rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be
available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model
that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while
demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies
that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training
phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted
regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we
benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a
top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms.
The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30\% of the datasets,
being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient
with an average training time reduction of 274\% compared to other
embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the
embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec
can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an
excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing
resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and
efficiently.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore a multi-modal approach to enhancing
live broadcast engagement by developing a short video recommendation system
that incorporates Multi-modal Graph Convolutional Networks (MMGCN) with user
preferences. In order to provide personalized recommendations tailored to
individual interests, the proposed system takes into account user interaction
data, video content features, and contextual information. With the aid of a
hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
techniques, the system is able to capture nuanced relationships between users,
video attributes, and engagement patterns. Three datasets are used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the system: Kwai, TikTok, and MovieLens. Compared to
baseline models, such as DeepFM, Wide & Deep, LightGBM, and XGBoost, the
proposed MMGCN-based model shows superior performance. A notable feature of the
proposed model is that it outperforms all baseline methods in capturing diverse
user preferences and making accurate, personalized recommendations, resulting
in a Kwai F1 score of 0.574, a Tiktok F1 score of 0.506, and a MovieLens F1
score of 0.197. We emphasize the importance of multi-modal integration and
user-centric approaches in advancing recommender systems, emphasizing the role
they play in enhancing content discovery and audience interaction on live
broadcast platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习方法在稀疏广告场景中面临严重高估、分布偏移和预算约束忽略的问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出MTORL模型，包括广告特定的MDP框架、因果状态编码器、因果注意力机制和多任务学习，用于同时处理渠道推荐和预算分配。

Result: 在离线和在线环境中，MTORL表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTORL通过多任务学习和因果建模，有效解决了广告推荐中的关键挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant
attention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget
allocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL)
methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising
scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and
overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a
novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we
establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of
advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user
interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through
conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to
enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal
states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards,
simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation.
Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks
into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online
environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中如何同时利用用户短期和长期偏好的问题，以提供更精准的个性化推荐。

Result: 实验证明CoVE能有效提升推荐性能，消融研究进一步验证了不同专家类型的影响。

Conclusion: CoVE框架通过结合短期和长期偏好，显著提高了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: In the online digital realm, recommendation systems are ubiquitous and play a
crucial role in enhancing user experience. These systems leverage user
preferences to provide personalized recommendations, thereby helping users
navigate through the paradox of choice. This work focuses on personalized
sequential recommendation, where the system considers not only a user's
immediate, evolving session context, but also their cumulative historical
behavior to provide highly relevant and timely recommendations. Through an
empirical study conducted on diverse real-world datasets, we have observed and
quantified the existence and impact of both short-term (immediate and
transient) and long-term (enduring and stable) preferences on users' historical
interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a framework that combines
short- and long-term preferences to enhance recommendation performance, namely
Compositions of Variant Experts (CoVE). This novel framework dynamically
integrates short- and long-term preferences through the use of different
specialized recommendation models (i.e., experts). Extensive experiments
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods and ablation studies further
investigate the impact of variant expert types.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了可变展示长度排序任务，通过VLPL方法联合优化文档排序和展示长度，解决了传统LTR方法未考虑展示长度影响的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LTR方法假设文档展示格式相同，但实际中展示长度会影响用户对相关性的感知和注意力分配，因此需要研究如何联合优化排序和展示长度。

Method: 提出VLPL方法，基于Plackett-Luce模型，通过梯度估计联合优化文档排序和展示长度。

Result: 实验表明VLPL能有效平衡文档的曝光和吸引力，优于固定长度模型，且简单长度感知方法也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了结合文档展示与LTR的重要性及挑战，VLPL为解决这一问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Learning to Rank (LTR) methods generally assume that each document in a top-K
ranking is presented in an equal format. However, previous work has shown that
users' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,
allocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual
or image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect
attention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when
scrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a
fixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been
addressed by existing LTR methods.
  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking
task, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation
length is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show
that this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability
ranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem
cannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.
  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient
estimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.
Our semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the
expected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best
performance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that
even simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance
improvements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and
empirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining
document presentation with LTR.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce industry has become integral to people's daily
lives, leveraging technological advancements to offer personalized shopping
experiences, primarily through recommendation systems that enhance customer
engagement through personalized suggestions. To improve customers' experience
in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for

retrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to
recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance
the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate
algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial
needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on
framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining
realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module
empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the
customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for
retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and
provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results
of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive
system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法通常依赖结果空间的离散化来确保真实性，但随着问题规模增大，效率降低。

Method: 提出基于定价规则的新菜单机制，利用Partial GroupMax Network参数化定价规则，并开发了新的训练技术（如协方差技巧和连续采样）。

Result: TEDI在理论分析中保证了真实性、完全表达性和维度不敏感性，实验表明其性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: TEDI是首个无需结果离散化的真实机制学习方法，为自动化机制设计和可微分经济学提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces TEDI (Truthful, Expressive, and Dimension-Insensitive
approach), a discretization-free algorithm to learn truthful and
utility-maximizing mechanisms. Existing learning-based approaches often rely on
discretization of outcome spaces to ensure truthfulness, which leads to
inefficiency with increasing problem size. To address this limitation, we
formalize the concept of pricing rules, defined as functions that map outcomes
to prices. Based on this concept, we propose a novel menu mechanism, which can
be equivalent to a truthful direct mechanism under specific conditions. The
core idea of TEDI lies in its parameterization of pricing rules using Partial
GroupMax Network, a new network architecture designed to universally
approximate partial convex functions. To learn optimal pricing rules, we
develop novel training techniques, including covariance trick and continuous
sampling, to derive unbiased gradient estimators compatible with first-order
optimization. Theoretical analysis establishes that TEDI guarantees
truthfulness, full expressiveness, and dimension-insensitivity. Experimental
evaluation in the studied auction setting demonstrates that TEDI achieves
strong performance, competitive with or exceeding state-of-the-art methods.
  This work presents the first approaches to learn truthful mechanisms without
outcome discretization, thereby enhancing algorithmic efficiency. The proposed
concepts, network architecture, and learning techniques might offer potential
value and provide new insights for automated mechanism design and
differentiable economics.

Conclusion: 该方法对模型失配具有鲁棒性，能够处理分布外噪声和未知物理现象，为从实验射线照片中估计材料性质提供了潜在突破。

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental
observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material
science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the
primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does
not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which
prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here
we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving
the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model
parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool
to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data
does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush
model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence
of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high
impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of
compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine
learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical
parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact
experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model
parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and
physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the
robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned
approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of
out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby
promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from
experimental radiographic images.

Result: 对称群情况下可达性问题可在PSPACE内解决，而一般VASS则具有Ackermannian复杂度。

Conclusion: 对称性显著降低了VASS可达性问题的复杂度，为数据VASS的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems
with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of
permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields
general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the
reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of
input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We
also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones.
Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data
VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination
of the trivial and symmetric groups.

Conclusion: 该算法在动态网络环境下表现优越，适用于实际应用中的非线性问题。

Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by
enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of
computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed
algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking
technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding
momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii)
addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing
network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound
mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical
applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using
perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in
the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost
functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms,
we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and
perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents
to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.

Result: 证明了两种框架下存在确定性最优策略，并分析了它们之间的关系及价值函数差异的界限。

Conclusion: FOpt框架赋予局部控制器更多自主性，且在特定条件下与COpt框架具有相同的优化效果。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture
for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$
independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each
formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating
at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative
reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a
faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the
COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an
infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller
optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure,
where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First,
the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these
frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two
frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two
optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such
that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.

Abstract: This paper reports IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \& Expo (ICME)
2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement.
With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range
(HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and
generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly
demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance
across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This
challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of
jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams
submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR)
and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF
baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance,
setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.

TL;DR: FedCLAM是一种联邦学习方法，通过客户端自适应动量和个性化阻尼因子解决医学影像中的特征差异问题，并在分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中因设备和人群差异导致特征不一致，现有联邦学习方法难以适应，需改进。

Method: 提出FedCLAM，结合客户端自适应动量、个性化阻尼因子和强度对齐损失。

Result: 在两个数据集上超越八种先进方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FedCLAM能有效处理医学影像中的异质性，提升联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 利用深度学习将2D实时自由呼吸电影图像拼接并转换为3D电影数据集，用于儿科和先天性心脏病的心血管磁共振成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心血管磁共振（CMR）在儿科和先天性心脏病中需要多次扫描，耗时较长。本研究旨在通过深度学习技术快速生成3D电影数据集，提高临床效率。

Method: 训练了四个深度学习模型，分别用于对比校正、呼吸运动校正、超分辨率重建和心脏结构分割。在10名患者中验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 成功将2D图像转换为3D电影数据集，处理时间小于1分钟。心室体积和血管直径与传统方法一致，但右肺动脉直径略有高估。

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速生成3D电影数据集，与常规成像结果一致，有望显著提升临床CMR的效率。

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CRISP-SAM2模型通过跨模态交互和语义提示改进多器官医学分割，解决了现有模型的细节不准确、依赖几何提示和空间信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多器官分割模型存在细节不准确、依赖几何提示和空间信息丢失的问题，CRISP-SAM2旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用渐进式跨注意力交互机制将视觉和文本输入转换为跨模态语义，并注入图像编码器；采用语义提示策略替代几何提示；通过相似性排序自更新策略和掩码细化过程优化医学图像分割。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，CRISP-SAM2优于现有模型，尤其在解决前述局限性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2在多器官医学分割中表现出优越性能，验证了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合解剖特征的扩散模型CA-Diff，用于提升脑MRI分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN和Transformer方法在复杂脑结构分割上表现不佳，扩散模型因忽略解剖信息而直接应用效果有限。

Method: 引入距离场作为解剖条件，设计协作扩散过程建模其联合分布，并加入一致性损失和时间适应通道注意力模块。

Result: CA-Diff在实验中优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: CA-Diff通过整合解剖特征显著提升了脑MRI分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

### [664] [Score-based Diffusion Model for Unpaired Virtual Histology Staining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23184)
*Anran Liu,Xiaofei Wang,Jing Cai,Chao Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互信息引导的扩散模型，用于从H&E图像虚拟生成IHC图像，解决了现有方法在分解染色风格与组织结构、可控染色过程及结构一致性建模方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏特异性标记，IHC染色受限于组织可用性和抗体特异性，虚拟染色技术有望高效生成IHC图像。

Method: 设计了全局互信息引导的能量函数、时间步定制的反向扩散过程及局部互信息驱动的对比学习策略。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有技术，具有生物医学潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法在虚拟染色领域表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成AI的数据增强框架，通过合成图像共享提升联邦学习在乳腺癌超声图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在医疗数据共享中具有潜力，但数据不足和非独立同分布问题限制了其效果。

Method: 使用两类特定的深度卷积生成对抗网络（DCGAN）生成合成图像，并在联邦学习框架中结合真实数据训练。

Result: 实验显示，适量合成图像将FedAvg的AUC从0.9206提升至0.9237，FedProx从0.9429提升至0.9538。

Conclusion: 生成AI数据增强可有效提升联邦学习性能，但需平衡合成与真实数据的比例。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

TL;DR: MRF-DiPh是一种基于物理信息的去噪扩散方法，用于从高度加速的瞬态定量MRI数据中生成多参数组织图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习和压缩感知方法在MRF逆问题中精度和物理一致性不足的问题。

Method: 结合预训练的去噪扩散模型作为图像先验，并同时强制执行k空间测量一致性和Bloch响应模型约束。

Result: 在体内脑扫描数据上，MRF-DiPh优于深度学习和压缩感知基线，提供更准确的参数图。

Conclusion: MRF-DiPh在医学成像逆问题中表现出更高的可靠性和物理一致性。

Abstract: We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach
for multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state
quantitative MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our
method is derived from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a
pretrained denoising diffusion model as an effective image prior to regularize
the MRF inverse problem. Further, during reconstruction it simultaneously
enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space measurement consistency and
(2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments on in-vivo
brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed
sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better
preserving measurement fidelity and physical model consistency-critical for
solving reliably inverse problems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人工智能的像素级肺部评分（APL）方法，用于快速准确地评估囊性纤维化（CF）患者的肺部结构损伤，结果显示APL评分比传统方法更快且更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MRI无电离辐射，在儿科疾病（如囊性纤维化）中优于CT，但目前缺乏针对肺部MRI的定量评分系统，因此需要开发一种高效且准确的评分工具。

Method: APL评分包括五个步骤：图像加载、AI肺部分割、肺边界切片采样、像素级标注、量化与报告。

Result: APL评分每例仅需8.2分钟，比传统网格级评分快两倍以上，且统计上更准确（p=0.021），并与网格级评分高度相关（R=0.973）。

Conclusion: APL评分有望优化临床工作流程，并适用于其他肺部MRI序列和疾病。

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

Result: 使用开源数据集和模型验证了实时性和准确性，并提供了开源工具链。

Conclusion: 该技术可显著提升超声诊断的效率和可用性，尤其在即时医疗场景中。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Result: 在两个公共fMRI数据集上验证了HST的有效性，展示了其在疾病诊断和重建性能中的潜力。

Conclusion: HST为大脑动态表征提供了有前景的框架，有助于分析稳定性。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征，难以捕捉区域特异性细节，可能导致异常被忽视。

Conclusion: MedRegion-CT通过区域聚焦方法提升了CT报告生成的准确性和临床实用性，代码已公开。

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

Conclusion: VREx和Mixup的结合有效提升了模型在多源数据上的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

*Lachin Naghashyar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种生理感知的ECG合成和预训练方法，用于改善心肌梗死的早期诊断，尤其在数据稀缺时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心肌梗死是全球主要死因，早期诊断至关重要，但现有深度学习模型依赖大量标注数据，而实际中数据稀缺。

Method: 提出一种方法：(i)合成可调MI形态和真实噪声的12导联ECG；(ii)通过自监督掩码自编码和联合重建-分类目标预训练循环和Transformer分类器。

Result: 验证了合成ECG的真实性，预训练显著提升分类性能，尤其在低数据场景下AUC提升达4个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可控的合成ECG可在临床数据有限时有效改善心肌梗死检测。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early
diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep
learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but
require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Result: 提供了40名BPD患儿的MRI数据和分割模型，验证了其临床应用价值。

Conclusion: MRI和图像处理技术为BPD诊断提供了新工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm
neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation
and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms
of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as
the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and
baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to
support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集上的实验表明，SurgTPGS优于现有方法，提升了重建质量和语义平滑性。

Conclusion: SurgTPGS为下一代智能手术系统的发展铺平了道路，提高了手术精度和安全性。

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: FD-DiT是一种基于频率域导向的扩散变换器方法，用于低剂量CT图像重建，通过噪声逐步引入和去噪处理，结合频率解耦技术，显著提升了图像细节保留和噪声抑制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射，但图像因噪声和伪影影响诊断准确性，现有方法在保留细节上存在不足。

Method: 提出FD-DiT，采用扩散策略和频率解耦技术，结合混合去噪网络和滑动稀疏局部注意力机制，动态融合优化重建。

Result: 实验表明，FD-DiT在相同剂量下，噪声和伪影抑制效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FD-DiT通过频率域和动态融合策略，显著提升了LDCT图像重建质量。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers
from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise,
potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion
models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AFUNet通过交替优化的对齐与融合子任务，从MAP估计角度重构HDR图像，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖经验设计，缺乏理论支持，影响可靠性。

Method: 将HDR重构分解为对齐与融合子任务，通过交替优化和展开迭代构建AFUNet，包含SAM和CFM模块。

Result: AFUNet在定性和定量评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AFUNet通过理论驱动的设计，显著提升了HDR图像重构的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

Method: 采用扩散模型生成合成胎儿头部超声图像及其分割掩码，用于增强真实数据集并微调Segment Anything Model (SAM)。

Result: 合成数据有效捕捉真实图像特征，在少量真实图像-掩码对的情况下达到最先进的胎儿头部分割性能（Dice Scores: 94.66%和94.38%）。

Conclusion: 掩码引导的生成AI方法在医学图像分割中具有潜力，尤其在数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy
and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly,
time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these
challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution.
Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven
effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel
mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal
head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs
augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features
effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head
segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask
pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and
94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African
cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据且难以应对低对比度和模糊边界等挑战。

Method: 提出MedSAM-CA，基于预训练模型MedSAM，引入CBR-Net和Atte-FFB，分别用于边界信息恢复和多层次特征融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，仅用2%训练数据即达到94.43% Dice分数，接近全数据训练性能的97.25%。

Conclusion: MedSAM-CA在低资源临床场景中表现出色，显著降低对标注数据的依赖并提升分割精度。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,
demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的多域扩散先验引导（MDPG）方法，用于提升MRI重建任务中的数据一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散模型（DMs）在图像域中的随机性难以生成高保真图像，而潜在扩散模型（LDMs）在潜在域中提供了紧凑且详细的先验知识，可以更有效地学习原始数据分布。

Method: 构建了基于Visual-Mamba的骨干网络，集成预训练LDMs提供潜在和图像域的条件先验，提出Latent Guided Attention（LGA）用于多级潜在域融合，并设计Dual-domain Fusion Branch（DFB）融合欠采样图像与生成的全采样图像。

Result: 在两个公开MRI数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPG方法通过多域先验引导和k空间正则化策略，显著提升了MRI重建的数据一致性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

Result: 提升了模型在手术器械分割中的性能，增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedST有效结合手术领域知识，优化了联邦学习在手术数据科学中的应用。

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STCLocker的技术，用于测试多自动驾驶车辆（AVs）在协作中避免死锁的能力，通过时空冲突引导生成死锁场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术主要关注单AV测试，而多AV交通中的协作性能评估不足，尤其是死锁问题。

Method: STCLocker包含三个组件：死锁检测器（Deadlock Oracle）、冲突反馈（Conflict Feedback）和冲突感知场景生成（Conflict-aware Scenario Generation），通过引导AVs竞争时空资源生成死锁场景。

Result: 实验表明，STCLocker在生成死锁场景（DLSs）方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STCLocker填补了多AV协作测试的空白，为评估ADS的协作性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing
techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV
settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes
crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding
deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.

Motivation: 解决OpenMP pragma正确性问题，提高LLM生成代码的可靠性。

Result: 在108个真实C++程序测试中，P4OMP实现100%编译成功率，而基线方法失败20次。

Conclusion: P4OMP显著提升了LLM生成OpenMP代码的可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: We present P4OMP, a retrieval-augmented framework for transforming serial
C/C++ code into OpenMP-annotated parallel code using large language models
(LLMs). To our knowledge, this is the first system to apply retrieval-based
prompting for OpenMP pragma correctness without model fine-tuning or compiler
instrumentation. P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the
reliability of prompt-driven code generation. By grounding generation in the
retrieved context, P4OMP improves syntactic correctness compared to baseline
prompting with GPT-3.5-Turbo. We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,
GPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world
C++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.
P4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the
baseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on
non-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to
fundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP
consistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive
combinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code. We further
demonstrate strong runtime scaling across seven compute-intensive benchmarks on
an HPC cluster. P4OMP offers a robust, modular pipeline that significantly
improves the reliability and applicability of LLM-generated OpenMP code.

TL;DR: RAILS框架通过检索增强和迭代验证提升LLM在Java开发中的代码生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在软件开发中因缺乏外部文档支持而生成不完整或错误代码的问题。

Method: 结合FAISS和OpenAI嵌入技术，从Java资源中检索语义上下文，并通过编译器反馈迭代优化建议。

Result: 在78个真实Java导入错误案例中，RAILS表现优于基线方法，能更准确地生成代码和导入。

Conclusion: RAILS有效提升了LLM的实用性，未来将扩展支持更多语言和IDE。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-Turbo are increasingly used to
assist software development, yet they often produce incomplete code or
incorrect imports, especially when lacking access to external or
project-specific documentation. We introduce RAILS (Retrieval-Augmented
Intelligence for Learning Software Development), a framework that augments LLM
prompts with semantically retrieved context from curated Java resources using
FAISS and OpenAI embeddings. RAILS incorporates an iterative validation loop
guided by compiler feedback to refine suggestions. We evaluated RAILS on 78
real-world Java import error cases spanning standard libraries, GUI APIs,
external tools, and custom utilities. Despite using the same LLM, RAILS
outperforms baseline prompting by preserving intent, avoiding hallucinations,
and surfacing correct imports even when libraries are unavailable locally.
Future work will integrate symbolic filtering via PostgreSQL and extend support
to other languages and IDEs.

TL;DR: 量化对大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成任务中的鲁棒性影响首次被系统研究，结果显示量化模型比全精度模型更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注量化LLMs的有效性，而对其鲁棒性影响的研究较少，尤其是在代码生成任务中。

Method: 通过对抗攻击输入提示和模型架构噪声扰动两种视角，对四个LLM家族（LLaMA、DeepSeek、CodeGen、StarCoder）进行实验。

Result: 量化LLMs在51.59%的对抗实验中表现更优，噪声扰动实验也显示量化模型能承受更高权重干扰。

Conclusion: 量化不仅能降低计算需求，还能增强LLMs在代码生成任务中的可靠性，为开发更鲁棒高效的LLM部署策略提供新见解。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large
Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference
without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses
on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original
counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this
paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization
affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive
experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and
StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate
robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and
noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional
wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness
compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our
adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly,
our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation
generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest
that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually
enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights
for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于链式思维提示（CoT）、上下文学习（ICL）和大语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，用于从软件文档中提取隐私行为并生成隐私用户故事，结果显示主流LLMs（如GPT-4o和Llama 3）表现优异，F1分数超过0.8。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐私常被视为安全概念或事后考虑，导致合规问题和用户隐私侵犯。现有方法多聚焦于从法规中提取法律要求并评估合规性，缺乏对隐私行为的早期识别。

Method: 结合CoT、ICL和LLMs，从软件文档中提取隐私行为并生成隐私用户故事。

Result: 主流LLMs（如GPT-4o和Llama 3）在识别隐私行为和生成用户故事方面表现优异（F1>0.8），且参数调优可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可用于优化隐私需求的生成，为软件开发周期中的隐私需求提取提供了新思路。

Abstract: Research shows that analysts and developers consider privacy as a security
concept or as an afterthought, which may lead to non-compliance and violation
of users' privacy. Most current approaches, however, focus on extracting legal
requirements from the regulations and evaluating the compliance of software and
processes with them. In this paper, we develop a novel approach based on
chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), in-context-learning (ICL), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) to extract privacy behaviors from various software documents
prior to and during software development, and then generate privacy
requirements in the format of user stories. Our results show that most commonly
used LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama 3, can identify privacy behaviors and
generate privacy user stories with F1 scores exceeding 0.8. We also show that
the performance of these models could be improved through parameter-tuning. Our
findings provide insight into using and optimizing LLMs for generating privacy
requirements given software documents created prior to or throughout the
software development lifecycle.

enabling unbounded possibilities for both academia and the industry. However,
LLM development faces increasingly complex challenges throughout its lifecycle,
yet no existing research systematically explores these challenges and solutions

we systematically analyze research status throughout the LLM development
lifecycle, divided into six phases: requirements engineering, dataset
construction, model development and enhancement, testing and evaluation,
deployment and operations, and maintenance and evolution. We then conclude by
identifying the key challenges for each phase and presenting potential research
directions to address these challenges. In general, we provide valuable
insights from an SE perspective to facilitate future advances in LLM
development.

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states
(MPSs) into restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions consisting of a
multinomial hidden unit through a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition of the
MPSs. This method allows us to generate well-behaved initial neural network
quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial
time of the number of variational parameters and systematically shorten the
distance between the initial states and the ground states with increasing the
rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by
taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible
applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which
the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

TL;DR: TriADA是一种新型的三线性算法和设备架构，用于高效计算高维张量变换，特别适用于AI和HPC中的稀疏数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量变换在HPC和AI中需求高，但计算和内存消耗大，且并行处理增加能耗。稀疏数据进一步加剧了这些挑战。

Method: 提出TriADA，包括低秩并行算法、优化的GEMM内核、分布式3D网络和ESOP方法，以减少计算和通信开销。

Result: TriADA能以线性时间步长完成超立方算术复杂度的三线性变换，显著提升能效和计算稳定性。

Conclusion: TriADA为AI和HPC中最耗能的多线性张量运算提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and
artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors.
However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with
dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation
by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases
energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data,
which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear
Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address
these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel,
low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal
transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode
matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM
kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate
3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully
distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with
a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent
of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids
unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands,
thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability.
TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with
hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The
massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is
ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most
demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.

Abstract: Over the Eight decades, computing paradigms have shifted from large,
centralized systems to compact, distributed architectures, leading to the rise
of the Distributed Computing Continuum (DCC). In this model, multiple layers
such as cloud, edge, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile platforms work
together to support a wide range of applications. Recently, the emergence of
Generative AI and large language models has further intensified the demand for
computational resources across this continuum. Although traditional performance
metrics have provided a solid foundation, they need to be revisited and
expanded to keep pace with changing computational demands and application
requirements. Accurate performance measurements benefit both system designers
and users by supporting improvements in efficiency and promoting alignment with
system goals. In this context, we review commonly used metrics in DCC and IoT
environments. We also discuss emerging performance dimensions that address
evolving computing needs, such as sustainability, energy efficiency, and system
observability. We also outline criteria and considerations for selecting
appropriate metrics, aiming to inspire future research and development in this
critical area.

TL;DR: Libra提出了一种协同利用CUDA和Tensor核心的系统方法，显著提升了稀疏矩阵乘法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代加速器中的Tensor核心和CUDA核心各有优劣，单独使用无法充分发挥稀疏矩阵乘法的性能。

Method: Libra采用2D感知的工作负载分配策略，结合Tensor核心的高性能和CUDA核心的低计算冗余，并进行了异构计算的系统优化。

Result: 在H100和RTX 4090 GPU上，Libra平均性能提升3.1倍（最高9.23倍），在端到端GNN应用中提升2.9倍（最高3.9倍）。

Conclusion: Libra通过充分利用GPU的异构计算资源，为稀疏算子加速提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used
in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly
equipped with Tensor cores and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The
former brings superior computing power but only for structured matrix
multiplication, while the latter has relatively lower performance but with
higher programming flexibility. In this work, we discover that utilizing one
resource alone leads to inferior performance for sparse matrix multiplication,
due to their respective limitations. To this end, we propose Libra, a
systematic approach that enables synergistic computation between CUDA and
Tensor cores to achieve the best performance for sparse matrix multiplication.
Specifically, we propose a 2D-aware workload distribution strategy to find out
the sweet point of task mapping for different sparse operators, leveraging both
the high performance of Tensor cores and the low computational redundancy on
CUDA cores. In addition, Libra incorporates systematic optimizations for
heterogeneous computing, including hybrid load-balancing, finely optimized
kernel implementations, and GPU-accelerated preprocessing. Extensive
experimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that Libra outperforms the
state-of-the-art by on average 3.1x (up to 9.23x) over DTC-SpMM and 2.9x (up to
3.9x) for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for
sparse operator acceleration by fully exploiting the heterogeneous computing
resources on GPUs.

Result: 案例研究表明，通过优化地点和时间选择，可显著减少用水影响。

Conclusion: SCARF为水资源可持续计算提供了新方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Water consumption is an increasingly critical dimension of computing
sustainability, especially as AI workloads rapidly scale. However, current
water impact assessment often overlooks where and when water stress is more
severe. To fill in this gap, we present SCARF, the first general framework that
evaluates water impact of computing by factoring in both spatial and temporal
variations in water stress. SCARF calculates an Adjusted Water Impact (AWI)
metric that considers both consumption volume and local water stress over time.
Through three case studies on LLM serving, datacenters, and semiconductor
fabrication plants, we show the hidden opportunities for reducing water impact
by optimizing location and time choices, paving the way for water-sustainable
computing. The code is available at https://github.com/jojacola/SCARF.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence (AI)
with significant advancements such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and
Databricks' DBRX. This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges
encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group
services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2
Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate
the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our
performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts
across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find
that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time
for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency
over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple
software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop
optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result,
the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the
state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we
construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying
configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private
LLM systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在边缘设备上实现了高效、低功耗的推理，为动态适应多样化场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: As machine learning inferences increasingly move to edge devices, adapting to
diverse computational capabilities, hardware, and memory constraints becomes
more critical. Instead of relying on a pre-trained model fixed for all future
inference queries across diverse edge devices, we argue that planning an
inference pattern with a request-specific model tailored to the device's
computational capacity, accuracy requirements, and time constraints is more
cost-efficient and robust to diverse scenarios. To this end, we propose an
accuracy-aware and workload-balanced inference system that integrates joint
model quantization and inference partitioning. In this approach, the server
dynamically responds to inference queries by sending a quantized model and
adaptively sharing the inference workload with the device. Meanwhile, the
device's computational power, channel capacity, and accuracy requirements are
considered when deciding.
  Furthermore, we introduce a new optimization framework for the inference
system, incorporating joint model quantization and partitioning. Our approach
optimizes layer-wise quantization bit width and partition points to minimize
time consumption and cost while accounting for varying accuracy requirements of
tasks through an accuracy degradation metric in our optimization model. To our
knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of optimizing
quantization layer-wise bit-width in the inference serving system, by
introducing theoretical measurement of accuracy degradation. Simulation results
demonstrate a substantial reduction in overall time and power consumption, with
computation payloads decreasing by over 80% and accuracy degradation kept below
1%.

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices
introduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.
Reactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,
while proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing
on-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently
manage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade
heterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces
Agent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on
memory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu
first constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model
kernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel
annotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level
preemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC
utilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append
proactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware
dispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves
4.6$\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains
1.6$\times$-6.8$\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to
state-of-the-art inference engines.

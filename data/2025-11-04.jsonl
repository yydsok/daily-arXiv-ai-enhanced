This paper presents a\ncomparative analysis of lightweight transformer-based models, DistilHuBERT and\nPaSST, by classifying six core emotions from the CREMA-D dataset. We benchmark\ntheir performance against a traditional CNN-LSTM baseline model using MFCC\nfeatures. DistilHuBERT demonstrates superior accuracy (70.64%) and F1 score\n(70.36%) while maintaining an exceptionally small model size (0.02 MB),\noutperforming both PaSST and the baseline. Furthermore, we conducted an\nablation study on three variants of the PaSST, Linear, MLP, and Attentive\nPooling heads, to understand the effect of classification head architecture on\nmodel performance. Our results indicate that PaSST with an MLP head yields the\nbest performance among its variants but still falls short of DistilHuBERT.\nAmong the emotion classes, angry is consistently the most accurately detected,\nwhile disgust remains the most challenging. These findings suggest that\nlightweight transformers like DistilHuBERT offer a compelling solution for\nreal-time speech emotion recognition on edge devices.

This paper proposes a speech production analysis method using\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The networks are trained directly on\nthe governing equations of vocal-fold vibration and vocal-tract acoustics.\nVocal-fold collisions introduce nondifferentiability and vanishing gradients,\nchallenging phenomena for PINNs. We demonstrate, however, that introducing a\ndifferentiable approximation function enables the analysis of vocal-fold\nvibrations within the PINN framework. The period of self-excited vocal-fold\nvibration is generally unknown. We show that by treating the period as a\nlearnable network parameter, a periodic solution can be obtained. Furthermore,\nby implementing the coupling between glottal flow and vocal-tract acoustics as\na hard constraint, glottis-tract interaction is achieved without additional\nloss terms. We confirmed the method's validity through forward and inverse\nanalyses, demonstrating that the glottal flow rate, vocal-fold vibratory state,\nand subglottal pressure can be simultaneously estimated from speech signals.\nNotably, the same network architecture can be applied to both forward and\ninverse analyses, highlighting the versatility of this approach.

Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant\nlatency and cost overheads.\n  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a\nworkflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to\nselect the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification\nwith minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is\nrolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying\nbaseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across\nbenchmarks.

In this work, we first identify that DoRA's success\nstems from its capacity to increase the singular value entropy of the weight\nupdate matrix, which promotes a more uniform update distribution akin to full\nfine-tuning. We then reformulate DoRA into a mathematically equivalent and more\nefficient matrix form, revealing it as a learnable weight conditioning method.\nBased on this insight, we propose a unified framework for designing advanced\nPEFT methods by exploring two orthogonal dimensions: the architectural\nplacement and the transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Within this\nframework, we introduce two novel methods: (1) \\textbf{Pre-Diag}, which applies\na diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update to efficiently calibrate\nthe pre-trained weights, thereby enhancing performance while reducing training\ntime; and (2) \\textbf{S}kewed \\textbf{O}rthogonal \\textbf{R}otation\n\\textbf{A}daptation (\\textbf{SORA}), which employs a parameter-efficient\northogonal rotation to perform a more powerful, norm-preserving transformation\nof the feature space. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding\nand generation tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior\nperformance and efficiency compared to both LoRA and DoRA.

However, the existing\ndiffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal\ndependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating\nproprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the\npolicy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually\nderived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when\nthe robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer\nhandle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by\nthe visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and\nfacilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation\nlearning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures\nstructured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the\ntest-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the\naggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby\nenhancing the reliability of policy execution.

CompAgent augments MLLMs\nwith a suite of visual tools - such as object detectors, face analyzers, NSFW\ndetectors, and captioning models - and introduces a planning agent that\ndynamically selects appropriate tools based on the compliance policy. A\nverification agent then integrates image, tool outputs, and policy context to\nperform multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on public benchmarks show that\nCompAgent outperforms specialized classifiers, direct MLLM prompting, and\ncurated routing baselines, achieving up to 76% F1 score and a 10% improvement\nover the state-of-the-art on the UnsafeBench dataset. Our results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of agentic planning and tool-augmented reasoning for\nscalable, accurate, and adaptable visual compliance verification."}

Recent\nresearch has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task.\nBuilding on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables\ncontinuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on\nlearning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach\ninvolves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a\nlearnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure\nbehavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the\nreasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these\ntraveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track\nand align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce\nrealistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day\nroute choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and\naggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method\nmoves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying\nlearning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.\nOverall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and\nbehaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation\nthat can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis."}

These components are unified through an\nensemble-fusion strategy that enhances robustness and interpretability. On\nmathematics datasets, MiRAGE achieves Mean Average Precision scores of\n0.82/0.92/0.93 at levels 1/3/5, consistently outperforming individual modules.\nBy coupling retrieval guidance with multi-stage reasoning, MiRAGE reduces\ndependence on large-scale language models while delivering a scalable and\neffective solution for educational assessment."}

As this process is reversible, these\ntransitions also occur in reverse, where intermediate states progressively\nmerge, tracing a path back to the initial distribution. We demonstrate that\nthese transitions can be detected as discontinuities in $n^{\\text{th}}$-order\ncross-fluctuations.

While full fine-tuning is a powerful\nadaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a\ndegradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic\nforgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own\ntrade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length,\nwhile Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the\nchallenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best\nadaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative\nanalysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce\nscenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully\ninstilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general\nknowledge.

Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing\napproaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of\nnoise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal\ninteractions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in\ndiscarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal\nredundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises\ntwo key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of\nindividual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and\ndiscarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative\nability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck\nfusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nCH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method.

Based on this reformulation, we propose a novel decoding\nstrategy: Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding, which rejects only those tokens\nthat would lead to a utility drop in the final output. We refer to these\ncritical tokens as pivot tokens. We propose a method for labeling tokens as\npivotal or non-pivotal and train a lightweight classifier to detect them. This\nmethod can be viewed as a relaxed version of standard SD, which offers much\nhigher acceptance while preserving utility. We evaluate our method across\nvarious datasets, demonstrating that we can achieve up to $2.5\\times$ speedup\nwith comparable utility. Source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/amir-zsh/PAD."}

In this paper, we introduce AeroResQ, an edge-accelerated UAV\nframework designed for scalable, resilient, and collaborative escape route\nplanning during wildfire scenarios. AeroResQ adopts a multi-layer orchestration\narchitecture comprising service drones (SDs) and coordinator drones (CDs), each\nperforming specialized roles. SDs survey fire-affected areas, detect stranded\nindividuals using onboard edge accelerators running fire detection and human\npose identification DNN models, and issue requests for assistance. CDs,\nequipped with lightweight data stores such as Apache IoTDB, dynamically\ngenerate optimal ground escape routes and monitor firefighter movements along\nthese routes. The framework proposes a collaborative path-planning approach\nbased on a weighted A* search algorithm, where CDs compute context-aware escape\npaths. AeroResQ further incorporates intelligent load-balancing and resilience\nmechanisms: CD failures trigger automated data redistribution across IoTDB\nreplicas, while SD failures initiate geo-fenced re-partitioning and\nreassignment of spatial workloads to operational SDs. We evaluate AeroResQ\nusing realistic wildfire emulated setup modeled on recent Southern California\nwildfires. Experimental results demonstrate that AeroResQ achieves a nominal\nend-to-end latency of <=500ms, much below the 2s request interval, while\nmaintaining over 98% successful task reassignment and completion, underscoring\nits feasibility for real-time, on-field deployment in emergency response and\nfirefighter safety operations."}

Unlike standard \\texttt{tanh}-based\nPINNs~\\cite{raissi2019pinn,wang2022modifiedpinn}, our approach employs\nsinusoidal activation functions that enhance spectral expressiveness and\naccurately capture the oscillatory and dispersive nature of KdV solitons.\nThrough representative case studies -- including single-soliton propagation\n(shape-preserving translation), two-soliton interaction (elastic collision with\nphase shift), and cosine-pulse initialization (nonlinear dispersive breakup) --\nthe model successfully reproduces hallmark behaviors of KdV dynamics while\nmaintaining conserved invariants. Ablation studies demonstrate that combining\ninvariant-constrained optimization with sinusoidal feature mappings accelerates\nconvergence, improves long-term stability, and mitigates drift without\nmulti-stage pretraining. These results highlight that computationally\nefficient, invariant-aware regularization coupled with sinusoidal\nrepresentations yields robust, energy-consistent PINNs for Hamiltonian partial\ndifferential equations such as the KdV equation."}

WANDER operates directly on natural language prompts, employing a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) for semantic evolution of diverse sets of images, and\nusing CLIP embeddings to quantify novelty. We additionally apply emitters to\nguide the search into distinct regions of the prompt space, and demonstrate\nthat they boost the diversity of the generated images. Empirical evaluations\nusing FLUX-DEV for generation and GPT-4o-mini for mutation demonstrate that\nWANDER significantly outperforms existing evolutionary prompt optimization\nbaselines in diversity metrics.

This review examines how LLMs can support areas where the\nfield has historically struggled, including establishing cross-disciplinary\nconnections, formalizing theories, developing clear measurement taxonomies,\nachieving generalizability through integrated modeling frameworks, and\ncapturing contextual and individual variation. We outline the current\ncapabilities and limitations of LLMs in these domains, including potential\npitfalls. Taken together, we conclude that LLMs can serve as tools for a more\nintegrative and cumulative cognitive science when used judiciously to\ncomplement, rather than replace, human expertise."}

This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an\ninterpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand\nregional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be\nimplemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods.\nWe perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for\nregional value alignment. Experimental results demonstrate our framework\nsignificantly improves LLM alignment with diverse human values compared to\nbaseline methods, enabling more accurate social norm identification and more\nculturally appropriate reasoning. Our work provides a concrete pathway toward\ndeveloping LLMs that align more effectively with the multifaceted values of\nglobal societies through interdisciplinary research."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose the\nVideo Anatomically Constrained Transformer (ViACT), a novel framework that\nintegrates anatomical priors directly into the transformer architecture.

We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can\nimprove OPE performance via code optimization. We propose\n\\textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on\nlarge-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates\nresults, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established\nprotocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline\n(OBP)~\\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and\nScope-RL~\\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \\textit{two_agent}\nframework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization\neffectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability\nand the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both\ntwo_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%.\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated\n\"growth hackers\" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling\ndata-driven decision-making in production."}

Nevertheless, modality imbalance, stemming from factors\nsuch as insufficient data acquisition and disparities in data quality, has\noften been inadequately addressed. This issue is particularly prominent in\nbiological data analysis, where datasets are frequently limited, costly to\nacquire, and inherently heterogeneous in quality. Conventional multimodal\nmethodologies typically fall short in concurrently harnessing intermodal\nsynergies and effectively resolving modality conflicts.\n  In this study, we propose a novel unified framework explicitly designed to\naddress modality imbalance by utilizing mutual information to quantify\ninteractions between modalities. Our approach adopts a balanced multimodal\nlearning strategy comprising two key stages: cross-modal knowledge distillation\n(KD) and a multitask-like training paradigm. During the cross-modal KD\npretraining phase, stronger modalities are leveraged to enhance the predictive\ncapabilities of weaker modalities.

We present a theoretical\nframework demonstrating that resource-allocation decisions guided by gradient\ninfluence patterns can dramatically improve efficiency throughout the AI\nlifecycle. Our analysis shows that in transformer-based models, where a small\nfraction of parameters exert outsized influence (following heavy-tailed\ndistributions), three critical insights emerge: (1) updating only\nhigh-influence parameters strictly outperforms full-parameter tuning on a\nperformance-per-resource basis; (2) simple gradient norms provide\ncomputationally efficient proxies for identifying these high-influence\ncomponents; and (3) coordinated parameter and data selection yields\nmultiplicative efficiency gains, potentially reducing resource requirements by\norders of magnitude. Building on these theoretical foundations, we propose a\ntwo stage paradigm marginal-return pretraining for foundation developers and\ninfluence guided adaptation for downstream users bridged by gradient\nblueprints, metadata describing which parameters matter most for various tasks.\nThis capability-per-resource perspective transforms what were once considered\npragmatic hardware workarounds into theoretically optimal strategies,\ndemocratizing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities while significantly\nreducing environmental impact.

However, existing deep learning-based DA research\nsuffers from two critical limitations: (1) reliance on oversimplified scenarios\nwith synthetically perturbed observations, and (2) the absence of standardized\nbenchmarks for fair model comparison. To address these gaps, in this work, we\nintroduce DAMBench, the first large-scale multi-modal benchmark designed to\nevaluate data-driven DA models under realistic atmospheric conditions.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are useful for creating\nsynthetic medical images. In this paper, we propose a DL based methodology for\ncreating synthetic MRI data using the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (DC-GAN) to address the problem of limited data. We also employ a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify the brain tumor using\nsynthetic data and real MRI data. CNN is used to evaluate the quality and\nutility of the synthetic images. The classification result demonstrates\ncomparable performance on real and synthetic images, which validates the\neffectiveness of GAN-generated images for downstream tasks."}

Motivated by this trend, we revisit\nToeplitz covariance estimation through the lens of overparameterized GD. We\nmodel the $P\\times P$ covariance as a sum of $K$ complex sinusoids with\nlearnable parameters and optimize them via GD. We show that when $K = P$, GD\nmay converge to suboptimal solutions.

Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating\ntemporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time\nzero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve\n90.4\\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art\namong zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high\nprecision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing\ncross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity\nanomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in\nreal-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring."}

Evaluation shows AR1 achieves up to a 12%\nimprovement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a\ntrajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in off-road rate and 25%\nreduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training\nimproves reasoning quality by 45% as measured by a large reasoning model critic\nand reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B\nparameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm\nreal-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By\nbridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a\npractical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving. We plan to release AR1\nmodels and a subset of the CoC in a future update."}

A key\napproach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which\nbenefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray\nfree-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular\nstructure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by\nthe rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from\nthese distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains\nunsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address\nthis challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that\nthe network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum\ndistributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half\nthe length of a typical chemical bond."}

However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision\ntasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge\noptimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons\nwithin the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals\nthat a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer\n(MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously\ndevelop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to\nreplace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a\nneural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach\nallows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient\ninference solution for vision transformer models.

We\nintroduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that\ninjects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical\ncomplexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N.

We withheld all but the\nfirst 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models,\nfine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We\nrecomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time,\nposture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and\ncompared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).\n  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only\n8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded\nreaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07).

In addition to nonparametric mean\nestimation, the method models both random effects and residual variances as\npotentially covariate-dependent functions using flexible base learners such as\nregression trees or splines, enabling nonparametric estimation while\nmaintaining interpretability.\n  Simulations and real-world applications demonstrate accurate recovery of\nvariance components, calibrated prediction intervals, and improved predictive\naccuracy relative to standard linear mixed models and nonparametric methods.\nGBMixed provides heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification and introduces\nboosting for heterogeneous random effects. This enables covariate-dependent\nshrinkage for cluster-specific predictions to adapt between population and\ncluster-level data. Under standard causal assumptions, the framework enables\nestimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with reliable uncertainty\nquantification."}

It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods,\nspanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern\napproaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models\n(autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large\nlanguage models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types,\nsuch as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data,\ncategorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the\ncrucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification,\nclustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and\njoint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees,\nbenchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical\nchallenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and\nhyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving\nimputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that\ncan adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future\nresearch."}

On a subset of the EHRSQL benchmark, CELEC achieves\nexecution accuracy comparable to prior systems while maintaining low latency,\ncost efficiency, and strict privacy by exposing only database metadata to the\nLLM. CELEC also adheres to strict privacy protocols: the LLM accesses only\ndatabase metadata (e.g., table and column names), while all query execution\noccurs securely within the institutional environment, ensuring that no\npatient-level data is ever transmitted to or shared with the LLM.

This paper takes the theory of rate-distortion function, directed\ninformation, and Granger causality as its starting point to investigate the\ninformation-theoretic principles behind LLMs, leading to the development of\nsemantic information theory for LLMs, where the fundamental unit is token,\nrather than bits that lacks any semantic meaning. By defining the probabilistic\nmodel of LLMs, we discuss structure-agnostic information-theoretic measures,\nsuch as the directed rate- distortion function in pre-training, the directed\nrate-reward function in post-training, and the semantic information flow in\ninference phase. This paper also delves deeply into the theory of token-level\nsemantic embedding and the information-theoretically optimal vectorization\nmethod.

Using synthetic corpora with disentangled public and private\nlabels, we distill students under matched and independent random\ninitializations. We find that transfer strength hinges on alignment within a\ntrait-discriminative subspace: same-seed students inherit this alignment and\nshow higher leakage {\\tau \\approx} 0.24, whereas different-seed\nstudents--despite global CKA > 0.9--exhibit substantially reduced excess\naccuracy {\\tau \\approx} 0.12 - 0.13. We formalize this with subspace-level CKA\ndiagnostic and residualized probes, showing that leakage tracks alignment\nwithin the trait-discriminative subspace rather than global representational\nsimilarity.

Analogously,\nour model predicts geographic tokens hierarchically, first identifying a\ngeneral region and then sequentially refining predictions to increasingly\nprecise locations. Rather than relying on explicit semantic partitions, our\nmethod uses S2 cells, a nested, multiresolution global grid, and sequentially\npredicts finer-level cells conditioned on visual inputs and previous\npredictions.

In this\nwork, we present a new family MTPP models: the hyper Hawkes process (HHP),\nwhich aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining\ninterpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes\nprocess to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the\nprocess into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time-\nand data-dependent dynamics.

Although recent\nadvancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and\nlatency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct\noptimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning\npipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline\ntraining. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change,\nexisting models typically require substantial retraining to recover\nperformance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid\ndatabase tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one\nperforms a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the\nknob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large\nlanguage model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community\ndocuments for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to\nreduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the\nconfiguration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\nalgorithm.\n  We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared\nwith the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an\naverage of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with\nmodels trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in\nthe offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning\nstage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results."}

Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align\nstrongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and\nChain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing\nPK reliance. This work provides the first framework for systematic studies of\nmulti-step knowledge interactions in LLMs through a richer rank-2 subspace\ndisentanglement.

Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving\ngenerative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from\npaired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nbridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data\ntranslation.

Improvements in memory and context size have\nallowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more\ntext accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.\nThis comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their\nunderstanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may\nsilently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable:\nGPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of\ndiscussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a\n27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position.\nWe also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool\nuse, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief. We find that\nthese changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that belief shifts\nwill be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our analysis exposes\nthe hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended sessions of talking\nor reading, rendering their opinions and actions unreliable."}

Although machine learning (ML) and deep\nlearning (DL) methods have improved tag localization, localizing malicious\njammers within a single room and across changing indoor layouts remains largely\nunexplored. Two novel UWB datasets, collected under original and modified room\nconfigurations, are introduced to establish comprehensive ML/DL baselines.\nPerformance is rigorously evaluated using a variety of classification and\nregression metrics. On the source dataset with the collected UWB features,\nRandom Forest achieves the highest F1-macro score of 0.95 and XGBoost achieves\nthe lowest mean Euclidean error of 20.16 cm. However, deploying these\nsource-trained models in the modified room layout led to severe performance\ndegradation, with XGBoost's mean Euclidean error increasing tenfold to 207.99\ncm, demonstrating significant domain shift. To mitigate this degradation, a\ndomain-adversarial ConvNeXt autoencoder (A-CNT) is proposed that leverages a\ngradient-reversal layer to align CIR-derived features across domains. The A-CNT\nframework restores localization performance by reducing the mean Euclidean\nerror to 34.67 cm. This represents a 77 percent improvement over\nnon-adversarial transfer learning and an 83 percent improvement over the best\nbaseline, restoring the fraction of samples within 30 cm to 0.56.

Recently, Raviv proposed the use of\nrandom linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables\nefficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary\nfor neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under\nnoise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery,\ni.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy\ncompositional representation.\n  In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First,\nwe argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable\nfor VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a\nfolklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional\nrepresentations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In\nhistogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given\nas input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length\n$N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms. We present an\noptimal solution to the histogram recovery problem by using algorithms related\nto list-decoding, and analyze the resulting noise resilience.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce\ntraining costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We\npropose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel\nmethod that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on\nbusiness tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense\nreasoning.

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters.

NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

We evaluate our system on a\nchallenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising\nconsistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM\nbaselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.\nThis work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support\nexplainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex\nreasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08RVQA\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RVQA\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6b67\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027RVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Due to the impracticality of large-scale\nreal-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most\nstudies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity\nraw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce\nrealistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV\nscenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale\nefficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic\nLiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from\nmicroscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives\n(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the\nspatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index).

Accepted to the ICCV 2025 Workshop on\n  Vision-based Industrial InspectiON (VISION)", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models.

However, the extremely slow\ninference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based\ntalking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis.

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

To address\nthese issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs\nwith access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and\nreal-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new\nsecurity vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external\ndatabase can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior\nwork has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely\nheavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval\nand generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box\nscenarios.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP\nestimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem.

It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nwith group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance\nsampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact\nestimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.\nHowever, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy\nbetween the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We\nvalidate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is\nentirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient\nestimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps.

In contrast, insect-scale aerial\nrobots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body\nacceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot\ninertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high\nsusceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers\nrequires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the\nhardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and\nenvironmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube\nmodel predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and\nrobustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive\ncontroller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To\nachieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we\ndesign imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural\nnetwork, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of\ncentral nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like\nsaccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per\nsecond and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\\%$ and 255$\\%$\nimprovement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers\nunder 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force\nmapping errors.

Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch\nmap-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an\nagent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch\nmap as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale\ndataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71\nindoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying\nlevels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their\npreservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future\nresearch. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline\nthat efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve\nSkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual\nobservations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a\nRay-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature\nrepresentation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To\nimprove alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor\n(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site\nconstructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide\nnavigation.

Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection\nare either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against\ntransformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive\nGradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG\nis neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large\ntransformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a\nunified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original\ncontributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail.

Models are trained on normal operating\ndata across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault\nDetection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest\noverall FDR ($\\geq$92\\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top\nperformer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.\nEfficientKAN-AE reaches $\\geq$90\\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating\nrobustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger\nscales ($\\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.\nThe OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to\nmatch top KAN-AE performance.

Experiments conducted on seven NSFW\ncategories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over\nnaive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08IGD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4bNSFW\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91.32%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u751f\u6210NSFW\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u751f\u6210\u524d\u6216\u751f\u6210\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u533a\u5206NSFW\u4e0e\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u7c7bNSFW\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\uff0cIGD\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a91.32%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e03\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "IGD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2dNSFW\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose\nMulti-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs\ncoarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain\nshifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture\nglobal contextual semantics and scene-level structure.

Traditional\nnavigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for\ndynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door.

Next, the importance-aware clustering module\ncompresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving\nthe codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the\ncodebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the\ncodebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and\nmitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.\nExperimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method\nachieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering\nquality.

Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed\nCelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for\nocclusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the\nvisual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained\nvideo scenarios.

To\nensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond\nefficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches\nlargely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation\nrules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we\npropose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that\nintroduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\"\nreflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation\npipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a\nstronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical\ntaxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based\nclassification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained\nlevels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that\nHi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and\ninterpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy\ncontent safety systems.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference.

In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,\na Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D\nmedical image segmentation.

In the frequency\ndomain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global\ncontextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency\ndomain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D\nmulti-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and\nglobal cues.

Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,\nespecially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated\ndata for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to\nextract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results\nshow that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf\nNER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which\nuses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results\nwith an average F1-Score of $94.1\\%$ in the task of identifying characters and\nsolving for co-reference and $75.9\\%$ in interaction detection.

To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between\nactual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round\nof thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach.

However, existing\ncomputational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not\ndepressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the\nstandard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both\nclinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce\nReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each\nexhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the\nnine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a\nconcise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an\nexploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and\nemotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media\nnarratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines\nsymptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the\ndevelopment of models that not only detect depression but also generate\nhuman-interpretable reasoning.

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing\nmisinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an\nincreasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a\nstatic learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,\nand propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.\nHowever, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world\nscenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically\nevolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental\nRepresentations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social\nenvironmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to\npredict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the\ntemporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained\ndynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,\nMISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively.

Existing approaches typically\nfollow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;\nsecond, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates\nfrom the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent\nstudies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow\nmodels with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the\nneed for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the\nform of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\nfew-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LNN\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM-SS\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM-SS\uff09\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u7559LLMs\u4f18\u52bf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u53d1\u5c55\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM-SS\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images.

Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames.

Radar technologies offer a promising sensing\nmodality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar\ntechnologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of\nvarious objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained\nto closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data\ncollection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical\napplicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful\nreasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material\ncomposition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due\nto the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs\nhave no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we\nintroduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using\nLLM to identify materials directly from radar signals.

Current day missions are generally in the\nAI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based\non the AI recommendation.

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph.

Existing methods\neither perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt\ntext-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control.

To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional\ndiffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism\n(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and\ndepth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal\nAlignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a\nPanoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency\nacross monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR.

Experiments on nuScenes,\nSemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila\nachieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,\nwhile enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Veila\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5168\u666fLiDAR\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5168\u666fLiDAR\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5355\u76eeRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "Veila\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\uff08CACM\uff09\u5e73\u8861\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u51e0\u4f55\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08GCMA\uff09\u589e\u5f3aRGB-LiDAR\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5168\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08PFC\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u3001SemanticKITTI\u548cKITTI-Weather\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVeila\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38LiDAR\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Veila\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RGB\u5230LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits.

However, the success of these state-of-the-art\nmodels largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which\nlack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises\nquestions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.\nTo address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel\ninformation-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should\nbe a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based\non this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space\nModel (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by\noptimizing an objective function derived from our principle.

Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training.

Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study.

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason\nabout higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,\nenabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,\nan uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts\nand noise on segmentation accuracy.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining.

Current methods often rely on Vision and\nLanguage Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as\nimage-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level\ninteraction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding\ntextual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the\nmodel's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,\nwe propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an\nend-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware\nprompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware\nprompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on\nthe input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This\napproach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than\ngeneric image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine\nHOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which\nhelps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities\nacross categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve\ninter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate\nvisually similar but semantically distinct actions.

The challenge tasked\nparticipants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering\nstudent queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based\nnatural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,\nsolutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or\nhybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed\nvia logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student\nreview to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios.

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a\nmulti-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action\nflows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate\naction estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes.

Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nFormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff08HKG\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff08KG\uff09\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff08KGE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206KGE\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u8d85\u5173\u7cfbKGE\uff08HKGE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FormerGNN\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbHKGE\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff08HKGE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u57fa\u7840KGE\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdbHKGE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06HKG\u6570\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aKG\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ecf\u5178KGE\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63d0\u51faFormerGNN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GNN\u548c\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u90e8\u5206KGE\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eHKGE\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u7559HKG\u4fe1\u606f\uff1bFormerGNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709HKGE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0cFormerGNN\u4e3aHKGE\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new\nparadigm built on the \"Blueprint First, Model Second\" philosophy. Our framework\ndecouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined\noperational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution\nBlueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is\nstrategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex\nsub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path.

While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable\nalternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected\nby drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR).

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability.

Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria.

While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give\nextra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are\nresponsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable\noptimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users\nto associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users\nare not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.\n  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles\nand program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean\ncode summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it\ninto a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for\nactionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async\nProfiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a\nfine-tuned CodeBERT-based model.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic\ndata, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches\nindividually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial\nprecision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented\nintermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more\nstable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the\nimpact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,\nensuring robust learning throughout the training process.

Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or\nsingle-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource\nwaste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning\nframework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on\nuser-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA\ncompliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent\ninitialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that\neliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,\nand (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization\npriorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a\nself-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state\nrepresentation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA\ncompliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation\ndecisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML\nworkloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL\nachieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%\nreduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in\noverall SLA compliance compared to static baselines.

However, the\nintegration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,\nintroduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination\nproblems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse\ndistribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical\nrelationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that\nlead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies.

Existing\nenhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,\nlimiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge\ndetection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage\napproach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we\nintroduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores\nglobal illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and\ninter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust\npriors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error\naccumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs\ncomplementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure\nrefinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled\npatches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained\ndetails without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on\nhigh-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and\nprioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries.

Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching.

Current low-light image enhancement\n(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping\nnetworks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling\nunder extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on\nsimplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention.

Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and\n$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics\nthat are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better\nat higher levels of $K$.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations.

For example,\nthere is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with\nheterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their\nbehavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for\na wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical\nnumerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid\ntheoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence\nremain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging\nas a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed\naccuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is\npossible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both\ndata-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce\nUNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using\nspecially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence\nby construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a\nmodification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a\ndata-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate\niterative solvers.

However, despite\ntheir practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with\ndifferent stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step\nregimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and\nanalyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely\nsensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative\nstrength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is\nintrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and\ncauses exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method\nis lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible\nwith standard flow frameworks.

These methods either define the\nloss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),\nor indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge\nmuch more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as\ninefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the\ninefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly\nforms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs\noptimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual\n(SGR) loss.

We systematically benchmark the convergence\nbehavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL\nframework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and\ncompare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical\nexperiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL\nframework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster\nconvergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework\nshows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently\noutperforms the MSE loss.

Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed\nunder the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to\nunrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.\nTo support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and\nmodels, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying\ndata availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through\nresampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by\napplying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of\npotentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities\nenable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,\nin turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms\nwhen deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the\nproposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite\nof card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we\nalso illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account\nFraud (BAF) dataset.

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing.

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge.

However, their high computational cost and large\nparameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these\nissues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We\nintroduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with\nthe weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an\nAdaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or\noutlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating\nthe impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX\nunder various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,\nand sDCI datasets.

However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:\nspecific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,\nboth of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a\ndistribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the\ncurrent domain into the domain-specific representations with the different\ndomain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,\nwe propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the\nunified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further\nmitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)\nmechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly\nmodel inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps.

On our newly released dataset\nwith optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean\nper-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree\naspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual\npose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,\nwith our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.\nAs an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions\nenables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,\nresulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first\nend-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify\nper-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for\nexplainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadProPoser\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f7\u8fbe\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u67b6\u6784\uff08RadProPoser\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b3D\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u52a8\u6355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a6.425 cm\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.021\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "RadProPoser\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u96f7\u8fbe\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This assumption often does\nnot hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due\nto varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.\n  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each\nneural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the\nproblem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled\nfeatures from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying\nDSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static\nvisual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram\n- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a\nsimple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics\nwhen applied to the entire input.\n  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose\nPatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and\nindependently augmenting each patch.

To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality.

It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine\ndesign, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have\nbeen developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental\ntechniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making\nsignificant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has\ndemonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of\nquantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.\nQuantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,\nraising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding\nenergies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of\nQNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer\nperceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct\narchitectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure\ntheir quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with\nthat of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial\nneural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time.

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has\nbeen performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information\nextraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly\ndetection.

There is a lack\nof discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical\ninformation, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely\non high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the\neffectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical\ninformation (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and\nmorphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired.

To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this\npaper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS\nrethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,\nespecially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML\napplications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the\nMaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the\nMLaaS subsystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMaLV-OS\u7684ML\u4e13\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1OS\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316ML\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5229\u7528ML\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u6838\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5229\u7528OS\u4f18\u5316ML\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "MaLV-OS\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u5185\u6838\u67b6\u6784\uff08Micro-LAKE\uff09\u548cMLaaS\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u654f\u611f\u90e8\u5206\u5378\u8f7d\u5230OS\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210GPU\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "MaLV-OS\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9MLaaS\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MaLV-OS\u4e3aML\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e13\u7528OS\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve\na counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the\ninstitution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual\nexplanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,\ninformation-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of\nprivate counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that\nkeeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the\ninstitution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the\namount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,\ncompared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability\nof all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the\nuser retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of\ntheir features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their\nfeature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we\npropose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,\nbut ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and\nI-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their\nattributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received.

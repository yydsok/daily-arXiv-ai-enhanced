The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method,\nReinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the\ntarget model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native\nresponses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2,\nPayload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize\nsubtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as\nweather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous\nStrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation\nframework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across\nQwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a\nnew class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical\nexploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior."}

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer.

While\npowerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,\nthey not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also\nsteerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and\nprecise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ\noptimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to\nself-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when\nself-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief\nor answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty\nlevels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph\nstructures, and interject corrections.

We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic\nprofile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual\ncharacteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a\nuser-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task\nwith a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties\nfrom an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response\n(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our\nmodel enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material\nconfigurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we\ncreate a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for\ndeveloping and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse\nand challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model\neffectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,\noutperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods."}

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a\nnatural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.\nWe begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any\npositive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This\nis surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and\na natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under\nadditional information assumptions.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution.

In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem.

To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that\nHi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and\ninterpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy\ncontent safety systems.

To\nlearn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with\nparallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along\nintra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an\nentity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages\nafter every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin\nfraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,\nlifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\\% (vs. 74.1\\%) and raising Elliptic++\nillicit-class F1 to 88.1\\% (vs. 60.4\\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of\nrepresenting structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single\ngraph."}

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a\ncentralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be\nthe foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields."}

In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support).

CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the\npotential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support\nearly-stage drug safety assessment.

Additionally, LLMs still struggle with\nhallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is\nparticularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or\nsource code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for\nInterpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors\nin interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact\nfunctional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural\nlanguage) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a\nsystem of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection\nframework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based\ncorrection. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source\nLLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This\nbalance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the\ntrade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements.

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on\nkey words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward\ndenoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the\nvalue model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value\nmodel is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and\nenabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric\nframework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two\ncore designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a\nfrozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These\nmechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture\nkey words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a\npassive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math\nreasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and\nmodel-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO\nbaselines.

Current low-light image enhancement\n(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping\nnetworks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling\nunder extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on\nsimplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention.

One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation.

We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal\nemission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing\nexperiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate\nmodel of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing\nnoise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided\ndenoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor\ndata, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in\nadditive manufacturing."}

To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This\nknowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,\nsurface-specific ``expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to\nadapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.\nTo meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a\nproduction-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,\nlogging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now\ndeployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating\nonline metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while\nimproving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency.

We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization.

We propose VRPO, a value-centric\nframework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two\ncore designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a\nfrozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These\nmechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture\nkey words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a\npassive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math\nreasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and\nmodel-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO\nbaselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value\nmodel in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy\noptimization in noisy real-world environments."}

Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework.

The latter dynamically adapts to\nthe job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network\nbandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has\nin common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and\nto the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,\nusing OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level\noptimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML\ncontext. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this\npaper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS\nrethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,\nespecially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML\napplications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the\nMaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the\nMLaaS subsystem."}

To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests\nwhich are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework\non three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the\nOMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually\ngenerating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language\nmodels can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated\ntraining datasets."}

Wong", "Songyang Zhang", "Kai Chen"], "title": "CompassVerifier: A Unified and Robust Verifier for LLMs Evaluation and Outcome Reward", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": "Technical Report; 31 Pages", "summary": "Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models\n(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but\nalso serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code\nand dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier."}

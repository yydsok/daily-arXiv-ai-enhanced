This has been due in\npart to the high classification accuracy of image classification through\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based\nrecognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio\nrecordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms).\nIt is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input.\nHowever, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of\na species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve\nspecies classification. In this paper we present how a single-species\nrecognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as\ninputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the\nimprovements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher\nnumber of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks\nthat use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than\nnetworks of similar size that use only one of the inputs."}

Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the\nanalyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many\nindependent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should\nbe discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model\nrun? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules\nof thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly\nbecause addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their\nlimited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology,\ndrawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and\nprovide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the\nmost popular ABM platforms.

Therefore, we propose the\nISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable\nzero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the\nsigner's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through\nthe video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the\nsegmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body\nparts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information.

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}

This study used electroencephalography\n(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.\nBehavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as\ncomparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor\nelicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the\nprocessing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive\nPotential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional\nresponse. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial\nexpectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal\ndynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an\nincreasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor\ndemonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a\ndecreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain\ncan dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of\ncumulative reinforcement challenges \"algorithm aversion\" in humor, as it\ndemonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an\nintensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes\ntoward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI\ntrustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings\nindicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and\nintense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine\nengagement in human-AI social interaction."}

The key idea is to combine B-spline\ntrajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points\nwith a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic\nsearch. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form,\nmitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to\nmodel inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard\nprogressive training pipeline in simulation.

Our framework\ntransforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the\ntarget neural network that captures complete topological relationships between\nlayers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a\nglobal view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph\nrepresentation and generates a rich embedding.

This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties\ndue to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:\nquantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.\nTo attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general\nand training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error\ncompensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream\ntasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then\nreformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and\nultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.\nExperiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%\nsparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory\nreduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline."}

Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nencodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns\nthem with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph\ninformation. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address\nstacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate\noutperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster\ninference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong\ngeneralization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates\nsuperiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and\nreal-world settings.

We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines\nthe mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the\nflexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the\nconcept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear\nfunctions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results\nshow that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple\npolynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,\nNN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex\nnonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip\nsystems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based\nframework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities\nwhile maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the\nCCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with\ndiscontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using\ntraditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool\nfor nonlinear system identification."}

In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen.

The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar\nreward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This\nproblem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state\nrather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal\nis quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching\ntechniques enable agents to learn from such feedback.

The most common way of representing skin\ntone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has\nbeen criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for\nlighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the\ngranularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models.

To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle\nidentification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with\nMulti-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This\nmodel offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning\nfrom few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been\nrigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning\ntechniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle\nidentification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores."}

This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python\nprograms, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code\nfragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual\neffort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program\ntest suites."}

The key to solving this problem lies in\navoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes\nduring continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works\ncumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store\nand utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid\ncatastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between\nclasses shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will\ncontinuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in\nknowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve\ndomain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.\nSpecifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we\nname as \"attribute\". In our framework, we learn a \"key-value\" pair to represent\nan attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value\nis the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each\ncorresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across\ndomains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention\nconsistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and\ncross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting\nwhile mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on\nthree CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.\nCode is available at https://github.com/RyunMi/VisTA."}

In this work, we revisit hallucination\ndetection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.\nLeveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of\nLLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the\nsemantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic\ndepth of core concepts as they evolve across layers.

Recently, a breakthrough result circumvented the first\nimpossibility result by giving a deterministic algorithm in a $(2,0)$-fault\nsystem under asynchrony in the luminous robot (LUMI) model using 2-colored\nlights. However, a breakthrough result established impossibility of gathering\nin a $(2,1)$-crash system in the LUMI model under semi-synchrony. In this\npaper, we consider a {\\em mobility fault} model in which a robot crash only\nimpacts it mobility but not the operation of the light.\n  We establish four results under asynchrony in LUMI with the mobility fault\nmodel. We show that it is impossible to solve gathering in a $(2,1)$-mobility\nfault system using 2-colored lights, and then give a solution using 3-colored\nlights, which is optimal w.r.t. the number of colors. We then consider an\n$(N,f)$-mobility fault system, $f<N$, both $N,f$ not known, and give two\ndeterministic algorithms that exhibit a nice time-color trade-off: The first\nwith time $O(N)$ using 7-colored lights and the second with time\n$O(\\max\\{\\ell,f\\})$ using 26-colored lights, where $\\ell< N$ is the number of\ndistinct convex layers of robot positions in the initial configuration.\nInterestingly, for $l, f = O(1)$, our result is optimal.

Effective analysis demands models\nthat capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual\ncharacteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency\nmodeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by\nintrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to\nthe high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot\nprocess high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before\ndownsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling\nfine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,\nMulti-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as\ncomputation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual\ndependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This\ndoctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective\nlong-range visual dependency modeling.

Evaluated on a dataset of\n1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes,\nLogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for\nPPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.\nThe mean reward is 20.34 \\pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \\pm 43.98\nfor DQN and -0.17 \\pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode\n(constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves\nsmoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends,\naction distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's\nsuperior stability and efficiency.

Consequently, to reduce\nreliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ\nprojection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model\ntraining. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches\nfrequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse\nfacial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate\nreconstructions.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check,\nwhich enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking\nability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to\nthe user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their\nthought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to\nprovide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety\nAlignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason\nthrough direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety\ncapability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.\nNotably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning\ncapabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our\nmethod equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike\npost-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide\nhelpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm).\nFurthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples\ncan achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that\nsafety alignment may require less data than previously assumed."}

We propose PrivateDFL, an\nexplainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential\nprivacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds\nonly the difference between the required noise and what has already been\naccumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal,\nand tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep\nlearning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private\nStochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP).\nPrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID\nand non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and\noperating without a central server.

To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost.

To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs\nto detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of\nscientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting\ntechnology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024.\nResults showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a\nbubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble. While\nyearly citation networks reflected possible changes in publishing behavior of\nscientists between the two eras, there was a subset of AI era scientists whose\npublication influence patterns mirrored those during the dot-com era. Upon\nfurther analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH),\nthe data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form\nof financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists. In conclusion, our\nfindings imply that the patterns present in the dot-com era do not effectively\ntranslate in such a manner to apply them to the AI market."}

Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos.

However, it remains a\nprevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and\nenvironmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of\naccommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and\ncomplex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency\nmatrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)\nvalues to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability.

This paper addresses this gap by\nformally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number\nof modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact\nthe creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We\nintroduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the\ninherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments\nwith synthetic system models, we establish an \"analytical matrix\" to measure\nthese concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by\nthe number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly,\nwe demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased\nmodeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The\nimpact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy\n(e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for\nprediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a\nstronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers,\nguiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling\napproaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives."}

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral\nbottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation\naccuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and\nachieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks.

This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving\nimage generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve\ngenerated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial\nprompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where\nspecialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify\nweaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide\ninterpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent\nwhile preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge\nfor head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing\nproblematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with\nuser intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models\ndemonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial\nprompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with\nmore advanced MLLM components.

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral\nbottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation\naccuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and\nachieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal\nreconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight\ninitialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning."}

Many recent studies assume the attacker to be a regular user who can\nonly upload a single trigger image, which is more realistic than earlier\nassumptions of website-level administrative control. However, these works still\nfall short of realism: (1) the trigger's position and surrounding context\nremain largely fixed between training and testing, failing to capture the\ndynamic nature of real webpages and (2) the trigger often occupies an\nunrealistically large area, whereas real-world images are typically small. To\nbetter reflect real-world scenarios, we introduce a more realistic threat model\nwhere the attacker is a regular user and the trigger image is small and\nembedded within a dynamically changing environment. As a result, existing\nattacks prove largely ineffective under this threat model.\n  To better expose the vulnerabilities of GUI agents, we propose Chameleon, an\nattack framework with two main novelties. The first is LLM-Driven Environment\nSimulation, which automatically generates diverse and high-fidelity webpage\nsimulations. The second is Attention Black Hole, which transforms attention\nweights into explicit supervisory signals that guide the agent's focus toward\nthe trigger region. We evaluate Chameleon on 6 realistic websites and 4\nrepresentative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms\nexisting methods.

Applying this\nframework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the\ntransition from the \"quenched\" state to a more parallel and coherent \"annealed\"\nstate, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to\nfield polarity.

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}

Here, we\nintroduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM\nbenchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid\nBenchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items\ndepends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to\neach LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model\nbased on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to\nselect evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing\nin education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the\ncommon practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated\nbaselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We\nexamine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --\nand find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them\n(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).\nOur analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct\neffects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability\nspace, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.\nOverall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved\nby moving beyond static evaluation."}

Carnatic music, a rich\ntradition from the Indian subcontinent, is renowned for its rhythmic intricacy\nand unique metrical structures (t\\=alas). The most notable prior work on meter\ntracking in this context employed probabilistic Dynamic Bayesian Networks\n(DBNs). The performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on\nCarnatic music, however, remains largely unexplored.\n  In this study, we evaluate two models for meter tracking in Carnatic music:\nthe Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a lightweight architecture that has\nbeen successfully adapted for Latin rhythms, and Beat This!, a\ntransformer-based model designed for broad stylistic coverage without the need\nfor post-processing. Replicating the experimental setup of the DBN baseline on\nthe Carnatic Music Rhythm (CMR$_f$) dataset, we systematically assess the\nperformance of these models in a directly comparable setting. We further\ninvestigate adaptation strategies, including fine-tuning the models on Carnatic\ndata and the use of musically informed parameters. Results show that while\noff-the-shelf models do not always outperform the DBN, their performance\nimproves substantially with transfer learning, matching or surpassing the\nbaseline. These findings indicate that SOTA deep learning models can be\neffectively adapted to underrepresented traditions, paving the way for more\ninclusive and broadly applicable meter tracking systems."}

Recently, advanced and complex data processing has\ngained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows\ntypically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of\nresource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources\nfor effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is\nchallenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels\namong community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing\noptions. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially\nprocessing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from\nactual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this\ntwo-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the\nworkflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential\nfailures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for\ninitial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.\nIn this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning\nmodels within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and\nDistributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine\nlearning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges\nposed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate\nforecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive\ndecision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling\ndiverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources."}

We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set).

This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the\nacquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors\neffectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we\nillustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and\nboxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.\nExperiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of\ndirections merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.\nCoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on\nboxing.

However, algorithms to cluster this kind of data remain\nscarce, due to the challenge to simultaneously model the within- and\nbetween-time dependence structures for multivariate data of mixed kind. We\nintroduce the Mixture of Mixed-Matrices (MMM) model: reorganizing the data in a\nthree-way structure and assuming that the non-continuous variables are\nobservations of underlying latent continuous variables, the model relies on a\nmixture of matrix-variate normal distributions to perform clustering in the\nlatent dimension. The MMM model is thus able to handle continuous, ordinal,\nbinary, nominal and count data and to concurrently model the heterogeneity, the\nassociation among the responses and the temporal dependence structure in a\nparsimonious way and without assuming conditional independence. The inference\nis carried out through an MCMC-EM algorithm, which is detailed. An evaluation\nof the model through synthetic data shows its inference abilities. A real-world\napplication on financial data is presented."}

This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors.

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities."}

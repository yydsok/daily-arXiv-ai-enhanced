Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning\n(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential\nto enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions\nremains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two\nfundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible\nintermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning\nsignals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts\ngeneralization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we\npresent Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework\ndesigned for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.\nSpecifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate\nsignals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative\npolicy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into\nGRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting\nautonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce\nMulti-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM).

Most existing methods focus on reducing the\nnumber of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this\nwork, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity\ntradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length\nof the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the\ntransformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its\nlength. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow\nmatching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an\narbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our\n$\\textrm{ODE}_t \\left(\\textrm{ODE}_l \\right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in\ntime dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the\nprevious state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and\nImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\\times$ in the most efficient\nsampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for\nhigh-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully\nreproducible experiments."}

CNNs are effective at capturing spatial\nartifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.\nHowever, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal\nfeatures independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use\nseparate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine\nthem using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which\nlimits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we\npropose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse\nspatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows\ntemporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing\nthe model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as\nflickering eyes or warped lips.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with\nrespect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the\nother hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask\nfocusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent\npoints, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means\nrelaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary\nmanner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we\nintegrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet.

Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil\nerosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and\nenhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground\nbiomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly\ndue to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential\nfor identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted\nmanagement strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC\nmap, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making\nregarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual\ninspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive\nfield size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In\nthis context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are\ntwo prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation.\nThis study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed\nfor agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data,\nleveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass\npredictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a\ncoefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in\ndiverse field conditions.

This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain\ninherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of\nwhether observing 2D images or the real world.

To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality.

In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model\nfor graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation\nare parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that\nneed to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow\na stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs\nedges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for\nincreasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The\ngraph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable\nto deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods.

The goal is to learn the parameters\nin both state and observation models from the partially observed data for\ndownstream tasks such as prediction and imputation.

To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both\nthe coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers\nvaluable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and\nreasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model\ndesign and evaluation in practical applications.

This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability.

However, recent studies\nindicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms\ninherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.\nMotivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing\nframework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed\nto systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing\nlanguage model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as\nefficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing\nclassifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of\neither the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the\nmessage-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach\nisolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,\navoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge\nProbing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge\nencoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,\nconsistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations\nacross different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and\nsemantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation\noperations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on\nmessage-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative\nimpacts on probing task performance."}

We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a\ntransformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the\nsemantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature\nset encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric\nmeasures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a\nvast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the\ndata through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving\npoem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level\nclassification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,\nrevealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate\nthreshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly\nconfident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at\nlower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational\nforms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution.

For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms\nfor checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists.

Furthermore, we propose a\nmodel-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global\ncoherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image\nquality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and\nprovide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets\ndetailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various\ngenerative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images."}

However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes.

When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for\nlegal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\\% and halves\nend-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and\nefficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse\napplications.

However, it presents significant challenges, including\naccurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over\nlong sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024\nChallenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless\n3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the\nfirst time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge\nattracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid\ndockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic\napproaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,\nattention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the\nChallenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a\nconcise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying\nmethodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a\ncomparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.\nThe results highlight both the progress and current limitations of\nstate-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future\nresearch. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to\nfacilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving\nbenchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and\nimproved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at\nMICCAI 2025, reflecting its growing impact and the sustained commitment to\nadvancing this field."}

The\nmoderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned\nwith the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors\nthan ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference\nemerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an \"unnecessarily vague\" mean of 0,\nwhile Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.\n  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great\npotential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.\nHowever, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors\nto avoid over- and under-confidence."}

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve\nthe generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse\nCT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)\nreconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT\nimage noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior\ninformation from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a\nnoise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed\nNEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.\nFirst, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection\ndata, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT\nprojections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine\nreconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions\nto more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction\nfidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain\nreconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be\neffectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time\nstep matching strategy.

Although optical satellite\nimagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often\nhampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions.

Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre\nand post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating\nrapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is\ndemonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering\nmultiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that\nincorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance\nand generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with\ndetailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable\nand rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available\npre-event data.

Recent research has demonstrated that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis\nand code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom\nproblems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application\nrequirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and\nlimited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill\ntelecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,\nover OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed\ncoordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the\nabstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,\noffer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom\nchallenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical\nrepresentation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions\nwithin concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs\nin terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal\nintegration.

We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of\nmodules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models\nlearn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way."}

Under submission", "summary": "Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in\nlarge language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.\nWhile training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime\noptimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive\ndecoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,\nand speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or\ndisrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and\nLlama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP\nreduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2)."}

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation\noperator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data.

In CFL, clients are naturally grouped\ninto clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these\nclusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes\nclient embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the\ninsight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those\nin different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these\nembeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from\ndifferent clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated\naggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its\nsimplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,\nand (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model\ninitialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world\napplications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE\ncan recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and\nconverges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our\ncomprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic\nPersonalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets\nand an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves\nhighly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with\nstate-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and\nunsupervised PFL tasks."}

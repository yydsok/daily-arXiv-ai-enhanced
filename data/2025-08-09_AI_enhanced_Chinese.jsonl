These models enable highly responsive,\ndomain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken\ninteractions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE),\nconversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over\ntelecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for\ntelecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500\nhuman-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent\nqueries.

Current research predominantly focuses on\nmaximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated\nresponses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent.

To address this gap, we propose JPS,\n\\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \\underline{P}erturbation\nand textual \\underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of\nvisual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes\ntarget-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,\ncomplemented by \"steering prompt\" optimized via a multi-agent system to\nspecifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent.

However, these models frequently suffer\nfrom content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics\nand undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\napproaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained\nself-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core\nchallenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging\npreference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions\ninclude: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed\nvia phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture\nalignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three\ndistinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance\npositive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and\nGRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to\niteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization,\nyielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively.

To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots.

Building upon our prior LAMP\nframework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that\ncombines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for\nintelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration\ndata (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM\nprocessing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system\nclassifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and\nassesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance\nmanuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web\nsearches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date\nmaintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The\nGemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes\nimmediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts\nrequirements, and timeline specifications.

In these problems, each robot carries two\nfunctional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration\n(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but\nincurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal\nplanning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic\nmerging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning\nsolutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal\nfrom a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path\nlength and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded\ncollection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In\nHCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence\nback propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal\nsequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is\nselected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR\nalgorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results\ndemonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length\nby at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures\nconflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5408\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\uff08HCMR\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u8986\u76d6\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u670d\u52a1\uff08\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528HCMR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Morse\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u5f62\u9644\u7740\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u5408\u5e76\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8fb9\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "HCMR\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u534710.0%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1116.9%\uff0c\u4e14\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "HCMR\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u626b\u63cf\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The ultimate goal is to\nensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.\nUnfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in\ngeneral, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.\n  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting\nalgorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction\nvector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine\nlearning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we\nmeasure their error using the total variation distance from the true\nvaluations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with\nthe true values.\n  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility\nresults even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore\npredictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both\nthe predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the\nprediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate\nEFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary\nto the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the\nnecessity of predictions.

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency.

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4ee5\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RADAR\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRADAR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e867%\u548c13%\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic\nframework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game\ncalled the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand\nplayer and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve\nthis game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which\nalternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,\nthe players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's\nstructural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple\niterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions\nby incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.\nWe theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable\noptimization.

However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such\nas long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding\nsuicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art\nlanguage models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning\nmodels (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help\npeople annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included\nboth automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our\nproposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of\nextracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant\ncontext. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model\nachieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs.

Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain\nexperts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.\nTraditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,\nrequiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require\ncollecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this\nstudy, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our\nanalysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial\nrelationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and\nsidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they\nstruggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational\ngeometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when\nprovided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,\nLLMs are able to generate high-performing results.

Recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior\nknowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic\nprompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we\nrigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in\nsilico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference\nperformance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly\ntrained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot\nprompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or\nsuperior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,\nparticularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable\nlimitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including\narithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical\nlogic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,\nmeals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's\nlimitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through\ntextual inference.

This step\nyields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we\nintroduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific\nattention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost\nconfidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset.

However,\nexisting methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or\ndensely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for\nOW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental\nsegmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias\ncaused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.\nBy leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables\nprototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the\nlack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical\nprototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which\ncorrespond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual\nawareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined\nprototypes to optimize their label assignments.

Current structured pruning\nmethods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units\nand pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the\ninteraction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the\nfunctionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional\narchitecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.\nInspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and\nfunctional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and\npropose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within\nLLMs in this study.

We propose\nCodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code\nsnippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces\nthe following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a\nrepresentative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional\nprediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward\nprediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning\nsignals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous\naugmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code\nsemantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through\nmultiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from\nboth successes and failures.

It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective\nexpression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to\ndiscover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the\nhostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of\nthe situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the\nconflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a\ncustom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test\nparticipants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can\nsuccessfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of\nthe confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement\nmodality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test\nparticipants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the\nrobot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities.

A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps.

However, their long inference time, resulting from an\nextensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk\nbefore the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their\napplicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle\ntime. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy\nstructures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,\nwhich can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a\nmethod from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging\nsolutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent\niterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference\nand propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such\nas grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces\nruntime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy\nredesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained\ndiffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We\nalso provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful\nfor estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive\nsimulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with\ncomparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step\ndenoising.

Recent foundation models have demonstrated\nexceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale\ntraining, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion\nmodels is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth\ncompletion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain\nremarkable robustness without large-scale training.

We further design a dual-space propagation\napproach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse\ndepth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local\nconsistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable\ncorrection module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real\ndepth.

Prior\nresearch on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over\nreview reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a\ndecision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing\nthem within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that\ndecision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue\nagents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for\nrealizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,\nwe first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by\ngenerating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a\nself-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert\ndomains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality\nsynthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training\nmeta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue\nagents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform\n\\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task.

This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to\nlocal recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback\npathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.\nRecurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown\nto reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and\ninvariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)\nFamiliarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those\nin the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity\ntraining broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.\n(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.\nTogether, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global\nsensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid\nfast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for\nstudying rapid global context learning in the brain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528ViT\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63a2\u8ba8\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e9\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u5982\u4f55\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ViT\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLoRA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "ViT\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u56de\u8def\u7684\u719f\u6089\u6548\u5e94\uff0cLoRA\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5feb\u901f\u6743\u91cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8111\u5feb\u901f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Using real\nand synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,\nconsensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying\nclass imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and\nPearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in\nreflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to\nthe number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level\nequivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured\nexpert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced\nmetric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test\nresults using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This\nproposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by\nenabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure\ndetection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5171\u8bc6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u7b49\u4ef7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "Matthews\u548cPearson\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eAUC\uff1b\u5171\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u591a\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Fleiss k\uff09\u6700\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7AI\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u62a5\u544a\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6807\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001PPV\u548cNPV\u3001\u591a\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly\nadaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve\nsuperior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,\nwhile less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%.

This\nwould allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of\ndeployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to\nbiological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,\nwhich reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the\nreason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of\nvideo, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at\nodds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we\npropose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead\nof raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling\nbuffer.

However, their\napplication to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability\nand complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit\nsignificant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment\ndifferences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor\ngeneralization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning\n(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to\ntackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is\nimplemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities\nto identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary\nthrough text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific\nvariations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this\ndictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific\nvariations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for\nsegmentation tasks.

Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage\nthis trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment\nrange. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This\ndecomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss\nfunction, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,\nthus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its\nvariants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more\nconsistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical\nbounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical\nexperiments.

Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally\nstruggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing\nprecision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps\nor excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval\nAugmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with\nlarge-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL\nintegrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a\ndata synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is\nautomatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then\nemploy a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides\nthe optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of\nprecision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained\nprocess-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.\nIn practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,\nenabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically\nbalancing retrieval breadth and precision.

It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers\nto guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise\ngrounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses.

To reduce the number of\nrequired queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human\nteacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations.

To this end, we allow the novice to say: \"I\nplan to do this, but I am uncertain.\" We introduce the Active Skill-level Data\nAggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the\nnovice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating\nthreshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)\nForesight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and\nrelabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized\nInteractive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on\nuncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components\nbalance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required\ndemonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to\nchanging domains.

In most research focused on developing new AV control\nalgorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed\nsolely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping\nefficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of\ninteraction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework\nthat addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot\ninteraction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction\neffect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction\nability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on\nhuman drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply\nit to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts\nwith human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring\nHDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative\nmetric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how\nparticipants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,\naggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.\nThe results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the\nevaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver\nexperience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation approach.

However, existing CSS\nmethods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where\nsegmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to\ninterference between old and new class learning and suboptimal\nretention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage\nframework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic\nsegmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving\npast knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages\npre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode\nclass-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second\nstage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise\nsegmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both\nnew and previous classes.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation.

We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values.

Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often\nlack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer\nimproved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,\nlimited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design\ntrajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to\ngenerate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose\ntwo key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population\ndiversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and\nimprove alternative predictions.

To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,\nidentity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the\nneed for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly\nleverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer\nperformance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the\nsource image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce\nRefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the\nreference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive\nextraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and\nscalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during\ntraining.

This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with\nvigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR\napp on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth\nand rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,\nbleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation\nand questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking\nanalysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic\namplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations\non virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural\nnetwork that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal\ngraphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns.

The\nframework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,\ndomain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with\ncustomizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures\nsuch as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse\nmatrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables\nscalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing\ncomputational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to\nseven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers\nminimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the\nframework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still\nproduces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and\nadaptability.

To\naddress this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation\nMulti-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification\nby eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL\ncomprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which\noperates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance\nPre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution\ncounterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for\nWSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify\nirrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation\n(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution\npatch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence\nwith patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and\nefficient inference of DMIN.

Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate\nthat AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both\nclassification performance and inference speed.

This challenge is\nparticularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where\nlabeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference\nlearning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised\npre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive\ninitial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a\ncold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the\nmodel is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a\nsimulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career\nsuccess rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our\ncold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin\nfrom a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled\npairs.

In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables\ntraining with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and\neffective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a\nsingle type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL\nframework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple\nrelational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is\nlimited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that\nintegrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and\nconfidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement\nthis method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for\nclassification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and\nanother newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels.

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure.

Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual\nconditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of\nannotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data\nscarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first\nmulti-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains.

Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization.

Existing works\neither directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify\nusing attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some\nresearchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in\nthe target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into\nthe model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large\nmodels, which further limits their overall performance. To address the\naforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based\nvision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a\npre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\nand reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and\nlanguage generation.

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the\npropensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores\nhave high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately\ndegrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect\nestimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor\nWeighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the\ndeconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5DFW\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IPW\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u6df7\u6dc6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "DFW\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eIPW\u548cCBPS\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "DFW\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u6cbb\u7597\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result.

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Despite impressive\nadvancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents\nand overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently\nintroduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and\nreliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate\nmultimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the\ngeneration by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework\n(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.\nSpecifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and\nvision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned\nentities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality\nmultimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a\ndual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal\nretriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining\nprecision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for\nknowledge-based VQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff08mKG-RAG\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684VQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u5143\u7d20\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "mKG-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression.

We map weights to the fourth roots of unity\n$\\{\\pm1, \\pm i\\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically\noptimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a\nzero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only\nadditions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\\pm i$\noutperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of\nboth PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute\nefficiency.

However, most CVL methods\noutput only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant\nobservations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess\nlocalization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.\nTo tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an\na-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures.

However,\nlearning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a\nsingle individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits\noffer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the\njoint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and\naccurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not\nexist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all\nindividuals.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning.

Experimental results demonstrate\nthat F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,\nproviding a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.\nCode: https://github.com/paulili08/F2PASeg.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5782\u4f53\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08PAS\uff09\u548cF2PASeg\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5272\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5782\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u5305\u88f9\uff0c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u53ef\u4e3a\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b7,845\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684PAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51faF2PASeg\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "F2PASeg\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5272\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u672f\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "F2PASeg\u4e3a\u672f\u4e2d\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While chirality has been extensively\nstudied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point\nclouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex\ndescriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body\ntransformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and\nright symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in\ndifferent shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features\nwithin current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor\nbecomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose\nan unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape\nvertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.\nWe evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and\nqualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks\nincluding left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation\ndemonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility.

MLPs are represented as signed, weighted\nbipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard\nclassification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that\nbinarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas\neasy-task models remain robust.

Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight\nmagnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high\naccuracy.

However,\nVFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly\naligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)\nthe requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all\nclients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).\nTo address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to\ndeal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to\nsupport locally independent inference of new data samples for each client.

However, the\nexisting tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression\nratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful\nand concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers\nvia two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We\npartition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization\nfor each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation\nlimitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough\nwith more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from\nprior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise\nvariable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of\nvisual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct\nvisual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on\nmainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet\n50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.\nFLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19).

We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations.

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive\nperformance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and\nYouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated\nobjects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes.

Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions.

We further establish sufficient conditions under which the\npower of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two\ncritical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --\nenabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections\noutperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical\npower even under strict privacy budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u9690\u79c1\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65afJohnson-Lindenstrauss\u53d8\u6362\uff08JLT\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684FDR\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6216\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u4f1a\u7834\u574fModel-X knockoff\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u7684FDR\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65afJLT\u5bf9\u6570\u636eknockoff\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u8ddd\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86FDR\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e1\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86knockoff-based FDR\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded\n$p$-th moments for some $p \\in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence\nguarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex\nproblem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal\nsample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex\nregimes: $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively.

Achieving high-quality\nresults is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially\nin the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more\naccuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic\ninformation that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction\npipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying\nthe semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are\ndesigned for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is\ndevoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation\nis a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the\nunderlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers\nwith strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide\ndisjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation\nparadigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different\nlayers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the\nunseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer\nabove. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a\nnew synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground\ntruth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural\nnetwork settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse\nand fine grained per-layer garment identification.

However, the radio environment is unpredictable\nand often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods\nis often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the\nreceiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing\ndistributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect\nthe presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)\nare deployed on different places.

For instance, a\nchange that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.\nEstablishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate\nchanges effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature\ndeployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple\ncomponents across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.\nThey serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing\nconfigurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like\ndocumentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary\nstudy on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our\nstudy revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over\nthe past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these\ndependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay\nof 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often\nspend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a\nmedian of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify\ndependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML\nmodels.

Differential privacy provides a\nrigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling\nmeaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially\nprivate quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed\nsetting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the\nrelationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers\nor heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to\nthe non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type\ntransformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary\nleast squares problem.

Santos"], "title": "On the Reliability of Sampling Strategies in Offline Recommender Evaluation", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "comment": "Accepted to RecSys 2025", "summary": "Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems\nwhen online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two\nkey sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they\nare shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a\nsubset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has\nproposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on\nfixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model\ncomparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user\npreferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of\nlogging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.\nUsing a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate\ndiverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling\nstrategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model\nseparability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability\nunder exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth).

These unique characteristics introduce new\nchallenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional\nrecommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in\nrecent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the\nlack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature\nof live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the\nfirst real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live\nstreaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several\nadvantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple\ntypes of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich\nside information features for both users and streamers. These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive\ncan support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K\nrecommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift\nprice prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables\nresearch on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware\nrecommendation.

We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this\ninteraction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and\ntrust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model\nleads to a \"trust death spiral,\" a refined trust model creates a \"trust synergy\ncycle,\" increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a\ncobot equipped with a proactive Trust-Repair Protocol can overcome system\nbrittleness, reducing trust recovery time after a severe failure by over 75\npercent compared to a non-adaptive model. Our findings provide a framework for\ndesigning intelligent cobot behaviors that fulfill the Industry 5.0 pillars of\nhuman-centricity, sustainability, and resilience."}

Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's\nsystematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to\naddress, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI\noversight."}

To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical\ninsights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for\nAttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and\nefficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also\nshow that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt\ninjection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection\nparadigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can\neffectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate\nLLM-generated reviews.

While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent.

Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our\napproach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative\nmodel that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a\nlightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.\nEvaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to\nexpose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over\nstandard baselines.

However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average."}

Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the\nUniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that\nRAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.\nRAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining\nhigh accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG\ncompression.

We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

One vital component often found in such document processing\nworkflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,\nremains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain\nthe decisions of document image classification models through\nfeature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail\nto provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document\ncounterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's\ndecision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose\nDocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination\nwith classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual\ncounterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise\nrefinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target\nfactual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a\nrigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document\nclassification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3\ndifferent models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established\nevaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of\nthe authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative\ncounterfactual explanations in document image analysis."}

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction.

However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method\nintroduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization\nstrategy.

Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior\nperformance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring\nsubstantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time."}

Our\nresults indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active\nlearning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster\n(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new\nsamples to the training set using active learning does improve model\nperformance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the\nresults reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an\nimproved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the\nsampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off\nin performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good\njob of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points\ntowards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when\nthese less useful points are eventually added.

However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time\nseries remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality\ngap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time\nseries; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB\nthree-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with\narbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between\nthe deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for\nuncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose\nVisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on\nlarge-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a\nvision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series\ndata, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)\na colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time\nseries into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate\ndependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel\nreconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus\nmore flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive\nprior distributional assumptions.

Although current Composed Image Retrieval\n(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are\nconstrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To\nthis end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that\ngoes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing\nthe retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions\ncombining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant\nchallenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify\narbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically\nsimilar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct\nCOR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval\ntriplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also\npresent CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region\nencoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive\nlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms\nexisting models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and\neffective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for\nfine-grained multi-modal retrieval research."}

However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing\nmore detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users\nare on the move and cannot visually track progress. Longer-form communication,\nsuch as composing structured emails or thoughtful responses, requires\npersistent context tracking, structured guidance, and adaptability to evolving\nuser intentions--capabilities that conventional dictation tools and voice\nassistants do not support. We introduce StepWrite, a large language\nmodel-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability\nby enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form\ntexts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into\nmanageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware\nnon-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the\ncontext-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline\nmethods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and\nconversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite\ndynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent,\nand provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical\nevaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied\nactivities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load,\nimproves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods.\nTechnical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic\ncontextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact\nchecking.

In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting\nof the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient\nChannel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature\nrepresentations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.\nExperimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy\n(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones\nsuch as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our\nwork not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides\na solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain.

Our\nlarge-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals\ncritical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under\ndeception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where\nhuman speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less\nexpressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach\nhuman deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle\nwith natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data\nimproves realism but does not fully bridge the gap.

Although most existing methods address only one of\nthese challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach\nthat resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework\nthrough a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to\nidentify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's\nbehavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious\ncorrelations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus\nspurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate\nthreshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two\nphenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while\nminimizing the introduction of detrimental ones. We illustrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed method through extensive simulation and real-data experiments."}

The method was benchmarked against non\nprobabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic\nnetwork with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed\non synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in\nvivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed\nusing calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous\nRanked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper\npredictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight\noverconfidence was observed in D*.

In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to\nprevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,\nhowever, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred\ntissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic\nresonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading\nRefinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium\nas well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage\nCNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a\nprediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction\nwith the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial\nscar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during\ntraining, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the\ndiversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold\nensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm\nASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more\nchallenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through\nLA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation\ntherapy to treat AF."}

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.

This work presents a novel computational\nimaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive\noptics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use\nthe AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely\ncontrolled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images\nthat exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then\nbe jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we\nshow this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO\noperation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront\ndistortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate\nend-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the\nupsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal\nstatistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our\nexperimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,\ndemonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO\nsuper-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no\nhardware modifications.

Traditional synchronisation-based systems perform well under clean\nconditions but degrade sharply in first-person recordings. Conversely,\nface-voice association (FVA)-based methods forgo synchronisation modelling in\nfavour of cross-modal biometric matching, exhibiting robustness to transient\nvisual corruption but suffering when overlapping speech or front-end\nsegmentation errors occur. In this paper, a simple yet effective ensemble\napproach is proposed to fuse synchronisation-dependent and\nsynchronisation-agnostic model outputs via weighted averaging, thereby\nharnessing complementary cues without introducing complex fusion architectures.\nA refined preprocessing pipeline for the FVA-based component is also introduced\nto optimise ensemble integration. Experiments on the Ego4D-AVD validation set\ndemonstrate that the ensemble attains 70.2% and 66.7% mean Average Precision\n(mAP) with TalkNet and Light-ASD backbones, respectively.

For instance, a pasta dish might\nappear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting\nconditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the\nmost important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting\nin misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch\nFiltering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that\nshow greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF\ninvolves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less\nsimilar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded.

In particular, we verify\nthis on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and\ndemodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform\nbut in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary\nprocesses generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among\noscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual\nsynchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective\nresonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or\nstructural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both\nmechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra\nover several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto\ncritical point is not necessary for their emergence.

Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or\naudiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine\nlearning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices\npresents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open\nsource datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of\naudiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound\nrecognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available\ndataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model\ncomparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones\nconnected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with\nhearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene\nrecognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of\n0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of\naudiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning\nfrom the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time\nsound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+\nto an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest\nspecifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately\n50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms\nper 1 second of audio.

This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained\nrepresentations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively\nleveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise\nmanipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising\nover 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic\ndatasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of\nprecise manipulation and generalization.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding.

This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline.

In this context, larger attention weights may\nimply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based\nmedicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and\ninteraction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,\nthere is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful\nexplanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention\naffects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted\na user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in\nbiomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to\nvisualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who\nclassified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad\nsynthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the\nTransformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the\nattention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the\npredictions.

Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work\nfocuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either\nwith large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.\nInstead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that\nfilters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while\nkeeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,\nwe propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for\nactions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper\nstate.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information\non the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and\nhandwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are\nextremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to\nobtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools.

In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels.

D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically\ntrained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the\ncontrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other.

Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\uff08AKI\uff09\u3002LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u809d\u786c\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u4e2dAKI\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0eICU\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86MIMIC-IV v2.2\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u4e861240\u540d\u809d\u786c\u5316ICU\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u524d48\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUROC 0.808\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u73870.704\uff0c\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c0.911\uff09\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u809d\u786c\u5316AKI\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316ICU\u60a3\u8005\u7684AKI\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u964d\u7ea7\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the\nperformance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to\ninfrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and\nvisible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms.

The method establishes a federated training framework\ninvolving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private\nresource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is\noptimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while\npreserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage\npatterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This\nallows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while\nsharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance\nis used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and\nstability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a\ncloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study\nevaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise\ninjection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's\nrobustness and detection accuracy.

A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The\nmapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this\nprocess.

We theoretically identify that the\nproblem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component\ndecomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method\nfirst determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component\nsolely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it\nupdates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction\nthrough online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our\nmethod fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior\nadaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various\nreal-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nbaselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6e90\u7ec4\u4ef6\u504f\u79fb\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5355\u4e2a\u6e90\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7EM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u89e3\u6e90\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u6574\u6df7\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7d2f\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe67.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u504f\u79fb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue.

Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,\nreward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,\nhigh-performance language model adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RTTC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73TTC\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTC\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982TTT\u548cRAG\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u5e94\u7528\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u3002", "method": "RTTC\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRTTC\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u6216TTT\u3002", "conclusion": "RTTC\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous\nobject boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,\nsuch mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data\naugmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and\nits label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's\ngeneralization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel\naugmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to\naddress such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing\ncontrolled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving\nthe original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust\nrepresentations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves\nperformance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in\naverage on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even\nwithout bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit\nlabel noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other\ntraining tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.", "AI": {"tldr": "NSegment+\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u8fd9\u4e9b\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNSegment+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u65bd\u52a0\u5f39\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Vaihingen\u3001LoveDA\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747mIoU\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff08\u6700\u9ad8+3.39\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u5de7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "NSegment+\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, these\nmodels still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled\nwith specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie\nChaplin\", a ``mustache\" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not\nto include it, as the concept of ``mustache\" is strongly entangled with\n``Charlie Chaplin\". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to\ndirectly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of\ndiffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text\nembedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,\nand we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained\nthrough a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression\nwith Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention\nmechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions\nwhere it would otherwise be generated.

Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit\npreference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better\ncalibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.\nBy enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the\ngroundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised\nlanguage generation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PREF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u9ec4\u91d1\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8861\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cPREF\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1. \u8986\u76d6\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u901a\u7528\u51c6\u5219\uff1b2. \u504f\u597d\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u8d44\u6599\u8c03\u6574\u51c6\u5219\uff1b3. \u8bc4\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7528LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "PREF\u5728PrefEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "PREF\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.

The collaborative\ndesign enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to\nthe unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.\nTo further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label\nquality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)\nthat trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding\nthe learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used\nVSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark\nmodels, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and\nover 22.7\\% complexity reduction (in MACs).

We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial\npotential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their\naccuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,\nICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot\nlearning approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4bBPRS\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728CHR\u60a3\u8005\u75c7\u72b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "BPRS\u8bc4\u5206\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u4fbf\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u8017\u65f6\u8f83\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ece409\u540dCHR\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4bBPRS\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u7eb5\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\u60270.84\uff09\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u6807\u51c6\u5316CHR\u60a3\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts\nhuman dance motion from both egocentric video and music.

We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines\nboth egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.\nDrawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we\ndevelop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly\ncaptures the skeleton structure of the human body.

To address this, we propose\nDOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to\nuncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER\nleverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained\nmodels, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments\nsemantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER\nimplements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing\nand domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored\nsemantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.\nEvaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,\nDOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior\nperformance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing\ncompared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "DOTABLER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u8868\u683c\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u683c\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5e03\u5c40\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ca\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8de8\u6bb5\u843d\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u3002", "method": "DOTABLER\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8868\u683c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u57284000\u9875\u771f\u5b9ePDF\u6587\u6863\uff08\u542b1000+\u8868\u683c\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cDOTABLER\u7684Precision\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DOTABLER\u5728\u8868\u683c-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6587\u6863\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified\nmodels. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline.

Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind.

This is the submitted version prior to peer\n  review. The final Version of Record will appear in the MICCAI 2025\n  proceedings (Springer LNCS)", "summary": "Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed\ntomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis\nand treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved\nnotable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to\nsuppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary\nKernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain\nprocessing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural\npreservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and\ntrainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both\nspatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual\nunderstanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while\nmaintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that\nFIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art\nMAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR\nimprovement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's\nability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively\nsuppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's\npotential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural\npreservation and improved clinical applicability.

While prior work\nhas acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it\nto data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

Yet, recent progress in generation\nquality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility\nof these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based\napproaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by\nfocusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions\noftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and\nreal data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free\nguidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to\ncharacterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by\nleveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the\ngenerations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the\ngeneration quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks.

Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,\nachieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\\times$ speedup on GSM8K,\nand up to 276.67$\\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aICE\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u539f\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "ICE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICE\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8617.29%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c4.12\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728MMLU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86276.67\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ICE\u4e3adLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u5730\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of\ntwo-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address\nlocalization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA\ndatasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San\nFrancisco.

While existing efforts have focused on\ndeveloping fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where\nmodels often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based\nstructures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.\nTo address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose\n\\textbf{D}is\\textbf{E}ntangled \\textbf{C}ounterfactual \\textbf{A}dversarial\n\\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving\nGAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to\ndisentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this\ncausal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along\nwith a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only\nachieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly\nenhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

Recently, some FS-IAD methods based\non Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some\nachievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs\nfocus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human\nquality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified\nframework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while\nalso handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and\nnovel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive\ntraining strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages\ngradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and\ndiscrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context\nlearning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image\nas the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we\ndesign a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level\nanomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in\nconjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning.

By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers\nan up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current\ntechniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.\nAnother contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference\nstrategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,\ncaching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest\napproaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications\nacross various practical scenarios.

Specifically, an event\ncorrection module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image\nframes via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection\nnetwork to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling\nmodule (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image\nstructures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment.

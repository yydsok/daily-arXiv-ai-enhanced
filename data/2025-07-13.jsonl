Biases,\noften arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,\ncompromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers\nare less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made\nstrides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the\ncritical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more\nrobust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on\nbiased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive\nsampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It\naddresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and\nsampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of\nall classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias.

In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs.

This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting.

While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold.

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model.

We further show that lower\nGPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays\nan equally important role.

Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and\ndepth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often\ntrade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge\nthis gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a\nplug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and\na dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D\nflood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to\nmultispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer\nmodel to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without\nchanging the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is\nbased on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the\n2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood\nboundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case\nstudy on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled\nwith SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%. The resulting\n3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m.

This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to\nfacilitate further research."}

We address this challenge with the introduction\nof X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model\nmodified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for\neach modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using\nflow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an\nerror reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a\nnaive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical\nflow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available\nafter the review process."}

While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05).

In\ncontrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length\nrepresentations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or\nfamiliarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating\nvariable-length representations but typically require test-time search over\nmultiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov\nComplexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which\npredicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward\npass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a\nproxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely\nresembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to\nconditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.\nKARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a\nsingle pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of\nencoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.\nAdditionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive\nImage Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted\nimage complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.\nout-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition."}

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings\nhighlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional\ngeneralization in multimodal models without scaling the training data\ncombinatorially.

CARLA minimizes distance\ndeviations while integrating location potentials, ensuring more realistic\nactivity distributions. The algorithm decomposes trip chains into smaller\nsubsegments, using geometric constraints and configurable heuristics to\nefficiently search the solution space. Compared to a state-of-the-art\nrelaxation-discretization approach, CARLA achieves significantly lower mean\ndeviations, even under limited runtimes. It is robust to real-world data\ninconsistencies, such as infeasible distances, and can flexibly adapt to\nvarious priorities, such as emphasizing location attractiveness or distance\naccuracy. CARLA's versatility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for\nimproving the spatial accuracy of activity-based travel models and agent-based\ntransport simulations.

A single\nvehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of\naccidents.

However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data\nmodalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is\nimpractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles.

By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling\nstrategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different\ntasks.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of\nsensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact\nof prompt temperature parameters and task number variation.

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a\nWasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts\nmodel performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the\ncompatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To\nensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein\ndistance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nmodel performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law,\nenabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and\nunlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies\nhigh-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based\nmodel marketplaces."}

Since\nlarge language models (LLM) exhibit impressive potential in content\nunderstanding and reasoning, current methods explore to leverage LLM to\ncomprehend the complicated relationships among user, query and product to\nimprove the search performance of PPS. Despite the progress, LLM-based PPS\nsolutions merely take textual contents into consideration, neglecting\nmultimodal contents which play a critical role for product search.

Nevertheless, the redundancy and noise in PPS input stand for a great\nchallenge to apply MLLM for PPS, which not only misleads MLLM to generate\ninaccurate search results but also increases the computation expense of MLLM.\nTo deal with this problem, we additionally design two query-aware refinement\nmodules for HMPPS: 1) a perspective-guided summarization module that generates\nrefined product descriptions around core perspectives relevant to search query,\nreducing noise and redundancy within textual contents; and 2) a two-stage\ntraining paradigm that introduces search query for user history filtering based\non multimodal representations, capturing precise user preferences and\ndecreasing the inference cost. Extensive experiments are conducted on four\npublic datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of HMPPS.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the\napproach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during\nformation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from\ndisrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection\naccuracy and low rates of false positives."}

With the\nTransformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has\nemerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio\nrepresentations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the\nissues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled\nDot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence\nlength, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches.\nAmong them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and\nextended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches\nwhich have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two\ntopics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview\nencompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked\nspectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling\narchitectures, Mamba and xLSTM.

To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses.

We\nget 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA\nsuccess) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and\nreward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1)\nuser/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans\nhelp users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this\ngap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful\nwhen using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and\nquestion similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to\npredict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from\nreal user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we\ndiscuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem."}

We provide standard train, dev, test splits and release a\nreproducible baseline system. We benchmarked several Whisper variants under\nzero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Off-the-shelf models showed strong\ndegradation with distance, confirming a mismatch between pre-training data and\nThai far-field speech. Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved\nrobustness: a Thai Whisper baseline reduced overall WER from 64.3 to 38.3 and\nfar-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with especially large gains on the most\ndistant microphones.

The pipeline consists of: (i) Morphology Design, which maps tasks\ninto semantic tags, structural grammars, and OPH-compatible parameters; and\n(ii) Selection and Refinement, which evaluates design candidates based on\nsemantic alignment and size compatibility, and optionally applies LLM-guided\nrefinement when needed. We evaluate Lang2Morph across varied tasks, and results\nshow that our approach can generate diverse, task-relevant morphologies. To our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an LLM-based framework for\ntask-conditioned robotic hand design."}

To\navoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a\nthree-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)\nthat decouples capability from information availability on the same data and\ntimeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book\nrecall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves\nand the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet\nattribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency\nand timeline replay, E MARS+).

Our method leverages\nLLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset,\nevaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then\nencoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In\naddition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted\ntaxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated\ndataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability."}

The core insight of our UiG is\nto integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities\nduring the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative\nabilities. To achieve this, we introduce \"Image Editing\" as a bridge to infuse\nunderstanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated\nimage and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing\ninstructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,\ngradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG\nframework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image\ngeneration over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on\nthe long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

Our approach leverages BC policies as\nblack-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via\nsample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only\nsparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies\non high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world.\nIn particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nsuccessful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands.

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

The update rule of each\noptimizer is presented in detail, with an explanation of the associated\nconcepts and variables. The techniques applied by these optimizers, their\ncontributions to the optimization process, and their default hyperparameter\nsettings are also discussed. In addition, insights are offered into the open\nchallenges encountered in the optimization of deep learning models. Thus, a\ncomprehensive resource is provided both for understanding the current state of\noptimizers and for identifying potential areas of future development."}

We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two\ncomplementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated\nconvolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal\npatterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."}

Successive generations, including GPT-o\nseries, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale\nRL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model\nand rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits\nscalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are\ndiscarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that\nAPRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL\nalgorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%\nhigher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and\nhardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and\ndeployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies\nsystem-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of\nadvancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL\nsystems."}

The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer\nthat best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a\nhyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on\nnon-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the\nlatent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best\nneighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph\nConstruction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack\nthe ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction\nmethod. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized\nGraph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies\nkey-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold\nreparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable\nmathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the\nneighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding\nmethods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows\ntuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds\nare learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the\nmodel.

In\ncontrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to\ngeometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance\nvariations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the\nUHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,\ngeometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new\nsubjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression\nof dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these\nexpression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage\nto focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.\nDecoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly\nrealistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive\ndetails, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior\nappearance as well as motion.

We explore an\nalternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,\nwhere the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct\ndiagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work\nthat leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and\ngrounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is\noften easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'\ndiagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and\nintermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first\nsystematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and\neight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities\ngeneralize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization\nand medical question answering. Experiments with three open source\ninstruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward\noptimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the\ntransferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first\nsystematic assessment of \"reward model style\" reasoning over clinical KGs,\noffering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences\ndiagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare."}

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this\nknowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of\ntwo key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse\nweather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from\nclean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under\nadverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized.

To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps.

Code available at: https://github.com/ShanechiLab/SBIND/", "summary": "High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and\nfunctional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for\nunderstanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately\nmodeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this\nrelationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal\ndependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these\nmodalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to\nobtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However,\nthis process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss\nspatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning\nframework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle\ntheir behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate\nSBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional\nultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely\nremained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local\nand long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating\nbehaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing\nmodels in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile\ntool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging\nmodalities."}

These methods, however,\nassume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to\nreal-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming\nin. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL\nTool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a\nsuccessive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past\nlearned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as\na tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected\nbased on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the\ncodebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a\nvideo-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive\nexperiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific\nVideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our\nproposed COLT."}

Unlike traditional settings that assume\nthe Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an\nintervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others.\nUnderstanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as\nepidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks\nfaces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous,\nvarying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units\noften exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between\nstructural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on\nnetworks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance\ncomponents that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we\nadjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects\nthrough a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances\nexpressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as\nidentifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover\neffects.

However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

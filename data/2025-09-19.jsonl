While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent\npopulations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention\nfollowing, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability\nprofiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but\nalso reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis\nindicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with\nbetter performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents\nexhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that\ntop-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in\nscenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,\ntogether with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution\ntailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing\nteam may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,\npotentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide\nrecommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose\nfuture research directions to account for biases introduced by different\ntesting environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer\nboth strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more\ntransparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex\nsocial settings."}

Music can be described\nat different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level\nof artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect\nthis aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to\nfill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a\ndataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All\nA+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level\ndataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image\nrepresentations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums.\nFurthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows\naccess to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item\ninteraction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR\ntasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of\ngranularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on\nmultimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in\nmissing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre\nclassification in the movie domain.

The aim is to\nreconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a\ncommunicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign\nformation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on\nPeirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,\nand interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,\nlegisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the\ninterpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper\npositions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in\nresponse to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared\nuniverses of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and\ncommunicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,\ninterpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments.

Through\nrigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning\nnegative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration\nmethods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a\nmethodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:\nnegative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while\ndestroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to\nescape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE\nless than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize\nthis as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot\ndistinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60\npercent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent\nconfident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure\nrate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while\npost-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our\ntheorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.\nThis impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and\nestablishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely\nconvenient.

Departing from conventional strategies that approximate time-to-go\nvia linearization or small-angle assumptions, the proposed approach leverages\ndeviated pursuit guidance where the time-to-go expression is exact for such a\ntarget. Moreover, a higher-order sliding mode consensus protocol is utilized to\nestablish time-to-go consensus within a finite time. The effectiveness of the\nproposed guidance and estimation architecture is demonstrated through\nsimulations."}

However,\nexisting LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with\nhigh-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the\ndata's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for\nHigh-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates\ndirectly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT\npreserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and\nsecond-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,\nand it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),\nhigher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An\nalternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to\nefficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core\ntensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information\nof high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved\nclassification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,\nimages and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior\nclassification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and\nprior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker\nMachines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest\naccuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation.

Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation.

We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end\neffector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent\nthrough colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot\ncollaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED\nsignals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals\nwith pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires\nand position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived\nclarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while\nemotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did\nnot significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or\ntask efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that\nwhile emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task\nperformance in shared workspaces is limited."}

With the recent rise of generative large\nlanguage models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of\npapers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often\nreport near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility\nand utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key\nlimitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering\ndirect comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in\ncapturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically\nrelevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which\naim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a\nsurvey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity\nin reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to\nquantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we\nconduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the\nremoval of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their\nefficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations\nof such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes.

To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),\na novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with\ntask-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core\nsemantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and\ngeneralization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection\nframework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.\nTo ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse\nmulti-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora\nacross 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17\ncutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual\nstyles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing\nmethods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently\noutperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same\ntraining data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our\nDDL.

However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection\nmodule that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the\nVLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable\nconditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation\nstrategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using\nambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity.

We demonstrate that this human motion-informed\nprior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that\ndiffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in\nsim-to-real transfer.

It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the\nenvironment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has\nfocused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with\npre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots\nis necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this\nend, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,\nbending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to\ninclude the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these\nmodels to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model\nand simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our\nframework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for\nvine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that\nminimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.\nWe show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing\nuncertainties.

FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation.

We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference.

To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a\nvisual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against\nvarious corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the\ndevelopment of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and\nexpert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from\nexamining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of\nmodel behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works,\nVisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models,\nfacilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The\nutility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative\nevaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task."}

Existing\nstudies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all\ntest instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually\nassign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human\nannotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all\ntest instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test\ninstances.

We introduce RLBind, a\ntwo-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust\nunified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on\nclean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages\ncross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between\nclean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise\ndistributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,\nAudio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the\nLanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy\nand norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without\nsacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer\nmulti-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,\nand other autonomy settings."}

Their multimodal nature,\ncombining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream\nperformance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate\nindexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual\ninformation. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide\nretrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the\nuse of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense\nretrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods\nlike Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

While most prior work assumes a known causal\nmodel, recent efforts relax this assumption by enforcing additional\nconstraints.

This raises a\nfundamental question: Can we harness the benefits of causal reasoning to design\nefficient and effective fairness solutions without relying on strong\nassumptions about the underlying causal model? In this paper, we seek to answer\nthis question by introducing CausalPre, a scalable and effective\ncausality-guided data pre-processing framework that guarantees justifiable\nfairness, a strong causal notion of fairness. CausalPre extracts causally fair\nrelationships by reformulating the originally complex and computationally\ninfeasible extraction task into a tailored distribution estimation problem.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for\nmulti-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas\nbased on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler\nvelocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand\ngesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided\nWi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,\npaving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments."}

Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to\nlaunch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only\nindividual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this\npaper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also\ndiscuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to\nbroaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address\nthe evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered\nsystems."}

(ii) $s$-term DNF formulas in\nnear-polynomial time $\\textsf{poly}(n,(s/\\varepsilon)^{\\log \\log\ns/\\varepsilon})$.\n  Our main technical contribution is a quantum agnostic boosting protocol which\nconverts a weak agnostic learner, which outputs a parity state $|\\phi\\rangle$\nsuch that $|\\langle \\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^2\\geq \\textsf{opt}/\\textsf{poly}(n)$,\ninto a strong learner which outputs a superposition of parity states\n$|\\phi'\\rangle$ such that $|\\langle \\phi'|\\psi\\rangle|^2\\geq \\textsf{opt} -\n\\varepsilon$.\n  Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain the first near-polynomial time\n$n^{O(\\log \\log n)}$ algorithm for learning $\\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$\ncircuits (consisting of $\\textsf{AND}$, $\\textsf{OR}$, $\\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in\nthe uniform quantum $\\textsf{PAC}$ model using quantum examples. Classically,\nthe analogue of efficient learning depth-$3$ circuits (and even depth-$2$\ncircuits) in the uniform $\\textsf{PAC}$ model has been a longstanding open\nquestion in computational learning theory. Our work nearly settles this\nquestion, when the learner is given quantum examples."}

Due to the high\ncomputational cost and memory requirements associated with global optimization\nalgorithms, FWI is typically implemented using local optimization methods.\nHowever, when the initial velocity model is inaccurate and low-frequency\nseismic data (e.g., below 3 Hz) are absent, the mismatch between simulated and\nobserved data may exceed half a cycle, a phenomenon known as cycle skipping. In\nsuch cases, local optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based local\noptimizers) tend to converge to local minima, leading to inaccurate inversion\nresults. In machine learning, neural network training is also an optimization\nproblem prone to local minima. It often employs gradient-based optimizers with\na relatively large learning rate (beyond the theoretical limits of local\noptimization that are usually determined numerically by a line search), which\nallows the optimization to behave like a quasi-global optimizer.

A key\nelement in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which\ncharacterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given\nspace. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using\ncontext information collected from the environment, such as scene images.\nHowever, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric\ninformation from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural\nimplicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural\nAcoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and\nextracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.\nOur approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features\ncan better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR\npredictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various\nevaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets\nwith limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound\nsimulation."}

Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution\nscenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of\n$2.8\\%\\text{-}4.8\\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks\nwith non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with\n$2.4\\%\\text{-}3.9\\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks\nin MMMU."}

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative\nto integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor\ntrajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

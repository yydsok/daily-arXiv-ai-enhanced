Second, these techniques inadequately\nincorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,\nresulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic\ndeviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical\nsemantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt\noptimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive\nsemantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate\nhallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation\nmechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables\npreserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across\nimages.

While\nthese models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful\nevaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the\npace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current\ncapabilities.

We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized\ntrials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more\nsuccessful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,\nusing a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines.

Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an\n11-23% improvement in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "TokenShapley\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Shapley\u503c\u548cKNN\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u3001\u5e74\u4efd\u3001\u540d\u79f0\uff09\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Shapley\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u548cKNN\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u91cf\u5316token\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTokenShapley\u5728token\u7ea7\u522b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534711-23%\u3002", "conclusion": "TokenShapley\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work\nfocuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its\npotential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in\nsimulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical\nevaluation and integration into broader educational settings.

In contrast, humans learn these properties through\ninteractive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the\nreal-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot\nmanipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile\nsensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In\nthese experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects\nassumed to be static and placed on the table.

However, the high deformability of soft\ntissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,\nmeshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues.

We introduce a novel data-driven model, a\nconditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity.

We present a causally-motivated foundation model\nthat explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a\ndual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.\nLeveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same\ntarget is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured\nunder shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for\nthe underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated\nastronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars\nobserved by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),\nour method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation\nmodels on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes.

We\nhave assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of\nspeech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes\n- is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG\nresponses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the\ntransfer function of this system through two analytical techniques -\ntime-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency\ndomain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest\nthat alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands\nare the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant\nfrequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception,\nmaintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The\ncross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the\nhuman brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all\nchannel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these\nfrequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural\nprocesses are also dominant in native speech and music perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u5305\u7edc\u8ddf\u968f\u54cd\u5e94\uff08EFRs\uff09\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u03b1\u3001\u4f4e\u03b3\u548c\u9ad8\u03b3\u6ce2\u6bb5\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ef4\u6301\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u5305\u7edc\u8ddf\u968f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u9891\u8c31\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9891\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u5934\u76ae\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u03b1\uff088-11 Hz\uff09\u3001\u4f4e\u03b3\uff0853-56 Hz\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u03b3\uff0878-81 Hz\uff09\u6ce2\u6bb5\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u4ea4\u53c9\u9891\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u663e\u793a10-13 Hz\u300127-29 Hz\u548c62-64 Hz\u662f\u6240\u6709\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u7684\u5171\u540c\u9891\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5927\u8111\u7a7a\u95f4\u795e\u7ecf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

While\nprior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable\nrepresentations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and\npropagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,\nwe propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how\npredictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations\nand target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to\ntrace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during\ntraining. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a\nconsistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle\nlayers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,\nreflecting a transition between generalization and memorization.

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a\nprivacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the\nsubstantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for\nresource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL\nframework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's\nfunctional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to\nwhich our framework then allocates additional communication effort.

However, its dependence on\ncomputationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.\nIn parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides\ndiffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,\nbypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be\ninterpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate\ndiffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can\nintroduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we\nunify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free\ndiffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control\nobjective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals\nthe necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to\nthe true diffusion posterior.

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97).

Its\nsuccess remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided\nvisualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further\ncomplicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency.

Methods: We introduce a\ndeep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a\ndepth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously\ndefine the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework\nis proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and\narteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.\nFinally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance\nwith operator's feedback.

However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples.

To solve the above problems, we propose\nGSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS\nand 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.\nSpecifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of\nthe video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and\nthe polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object\nmotion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing\nstrategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)\nbased on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion\nand non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to\navoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to\ncompress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the\nBunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than\nexisting methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other\nmethods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task\nto SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSVR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0cGSVR\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "GSVR\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bunny\u548cUVG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGSVR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86800+ FPS\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548c35+ PSNR\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3a2\u79d2/\u5e27\u3002", "conclusion": "GSVR\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%\naccuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When\npaired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits\nstate-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on\nOSWorld).

Designers usually\norganize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to\nsimplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With\nthe rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in\npixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack\neditability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,\ninfluencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the\ncreation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose\nAccordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to\nconvert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining\nnonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user\nprompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct\nroles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the\nVLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods\n(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered\ndesigns, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually\nharmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.\nAdditionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element\nremoval models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers.

Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases.

This collective local\nmode-seeking mechanism, acting as \"collective wisdom\", steers samples away from\nspurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model\nimperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows\nus to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by\nsimultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS\nrequires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with\nvarious diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS\nsubstantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on\nchallenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Kernel Density Steering (KDS) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e0d\u826f\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0cKDS\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "KDS\u91c7\u7528N\u7c92\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u6837\u672c\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6837\u672c\u5411\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "KDS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "KDS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002"}}

It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images\nfrom head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations\nin infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full\nobservations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on\nanalysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer\nfrom imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their\npersonalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)\nfor the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale\ndatasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In\nthis work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),\nthat leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,\nto directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning\navatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly\ndisentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and\nviewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.\nFurthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the\nreliance on the paired captures.

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs.

Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical\nsuccess across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the\ngeneralization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring\neither graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of\njumping connections' role in sparsification requirements.

While object-centric flow\nprediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios\ninvolving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion.

Existing prompt-based and adapter-based\nworks have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the\nchallenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards\nunseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating\nall tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting\non less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and\ndegrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept\nrecognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a\nnovel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class\ngeneralization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the\nimportance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first\nemploys token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and\ngroup tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to\nthe importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature\nranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response\nmechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels\nidentified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1\nregularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA\nover existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on\nvarious benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and\ndomain generalization.

Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.\nTo make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation\nusing LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which\nthe same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By\nsimulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that\nrobustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate\nthe ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to\nsimulate respondent behavior for item validation.

Although\nvanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal\nmovement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over\nboth camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the\nunstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose\nLiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core\nprinciples: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we\nanalyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling\ndecoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced\nacross layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.\nThird, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)\nto linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a\nmodified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we\nextend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,\nunifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that\nLiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy\nand motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal\ntraining data.

Graph learning is\nsignificant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships\nthat traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting\nreal-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to\nrecommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like\nscalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and\ntrustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey\nprovides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key\ndimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,\nand responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for\nefficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal\ndependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph\nsamples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We\nalso explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure\nresponsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and\ndiscuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and\nother AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey\nserves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to\nnavigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8d23\u4efbAI\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u6210\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cAI\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u3001\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u56fe\u6837\u672c\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5982\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6AI\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6574\u5408\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose.

It combines rule-based analysis\nwith LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.\nEmpirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe\nbehavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%\nwith o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for\nstronger safeguards before real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenAgentSafety\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516b\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u572851.2%\u81f372.7%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6216\u72ed\u7a84\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOpenAgentSafety\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8106\u5f31\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u5360\u6bd451.2%\uff08Claude-Sonnet-3.7\uff09\u81f372.7%\uff08o3-mini\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "OpenAgentSafety\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, neural\nreconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense\nmulti-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we\nintroduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,\ninteractable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a\nthree-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D\nobject meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D\nsegmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video\ndiffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable\npart masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by\nocclusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by\na dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to\nensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated\nobjects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and\nplausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated\nasset generation.

This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing\nbetween such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between\nthe attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.\nWe begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to\nformalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human\nmonitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction\nbetween the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one\nreductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL\nfailure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL\nsetup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and\nEU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always\nachieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes.

Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent.

This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine\nauscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on\nclassification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.\nTo evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple\nexpert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated\nregarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous\nMitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of\n70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging\nindividual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification\nrobustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating\nthree classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While\nAdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost\ndemonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms\nshowed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied\nlabel noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of\nmild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity\nfrom 76.70% to 93.69%.

Despite its remarkable empirical success,\nits theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works\npredominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent\nwith momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t -\n\\frac{\\gamma_t}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ \\bm{m}_t$. This perspective\nnecessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy\nand opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In\ncontrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like\noptimizer, expressed as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t - \\gamma_t\n\\frac{|\\bm{m}_t|}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ {\\rm Sign}(\\bm{m}_t)$.

By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution\nlogs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent\nknowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success\nrates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3\nimproves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on\nintermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to\nimprove from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a\nmodular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from\npast experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agent KB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Reason-Retrieve-Refine\u6d41\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u590d\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u5f7c\u6b64\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6267\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAIA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534716.28%\uff1bClaude-3\u548cGPT-4\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent KB\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\npresent Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design\nimprovements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion\ncustomization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor\nthat generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set\nentities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous\nmethods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to\nintegrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each\nentity.

Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that\njointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit\nmapping between motion and personalization embeddings.

To this end, we propose Semantic\nCo-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for\npartial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant\nprompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture\ntext-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce\ninstance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module\nthat jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and\nco-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose\nan intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's\nunderstanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image\ntransformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label\nconfidence and sample difficulty.

Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that\nrequire pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.\nHowever, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in\nlocalization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach\nemploys a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and\nthen extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as\nwell as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is\nperformed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using\nradial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied\nto the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve\nvertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI\nbenchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the\nKITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard\ndeviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a\n55.3\\% improvement over the original dataset.

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature.

Our method combines Hierarchical\nNonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization\n(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix\nfactorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a\n46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).\nThese materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current\nand potential applications.\n  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with\nprobabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto\ncoherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,\nmissing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,\nsuggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our\nmethod by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known\nsuperconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the\nsuperconducting TMD clusters.

Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs).

Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples.

Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare\nactivity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class\nimbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on\nsequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while\nLSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding\nwindows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,\nparticularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)\nin the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an\nensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering\nmore accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models\ntrained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is\nattributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal\ncomponents, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the\npotential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction\nand highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and\nresampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u548cDLSTM\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\uff0cDLSTM\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LSTM\u548cDLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u96c6\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DLSTM\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08TSS=0.74\uff0cAUC=0.87\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u8000\u6591\u3002", "conclusion": "DLSTM\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u80fd\u529b\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\u3002"}}

Previous methods\nrely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to\nmisalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene\ngeometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the\naccumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in\nblurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose\nRef-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected\ncomponents to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric\nconsistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch\nrepresentation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency\nreflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo\nreflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we\nincorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness\nconstraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms\nclassical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with\nNeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)\ndriven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and\ngeneralizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes.

Standard\ndiffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large\nnumber of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial\ncomputational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to\nimprove efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To\naddress this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet\nfeature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD\nenables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,\nand effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by\nskip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the\ndistribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling\nthe model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,\nthe LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,\nallowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps.

The continuum limit reproduces free\nfermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.\nThe work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to\nfermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.\nIt extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding\nfermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications\nin quantum simulation and lattice field theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u590d\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CVNNs\uff09\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff08QFT\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff08NN-QFT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524dNN-QFT\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5c06\u5b9e\u503c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u573a\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc1\u660eCVNNs\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\uff0c\u6269\u5c55NN-QFT\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u4ee3\u6570\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53cd\u5bf9\u6613\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u51fd\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u4e0e\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5e94\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6743\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u573a\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u91cd\u73b0\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u660e\u786e\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50QFT\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6676\u683c\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.

Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation\nlearning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.\nWe leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision\n(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that\nour dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential\nbiomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues\naffected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that\nconfirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development.

However, the\ncommon lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and\ncopyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods.

Methods and\nresults: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that\nunderwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their\nnon-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders\nannotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the\nside branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and\n10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction\nof these features.

On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed\nhigh concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and\ncircumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance\ncorrelation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the\ncircumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal\nand 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable\nperformance to the analysts.

However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs\nin encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),\ntypically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and\nprivacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN\n(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel\nframework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical\nefficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook\ninput data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework\nachieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization\nstrategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance\nscores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted\ngraph.

To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce\nHRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,\nb) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on\nanalysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in\nStormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling\ndownscaling that improves long-lead accuracy.

Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing\nstill requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization\nof selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,\nmost studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in\ntheir evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based\napproach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and\nminimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We\nconducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a\nrandom search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks.

Existing\ndeep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,\noverlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a\npowerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new\nopportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce\nLangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages\nVLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).\nLangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a\nLanguage-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT\nimages into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion.

Direct application\nof segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal\nperformance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address\nthese challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been\nproposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult,\npediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including\nthe network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric,\nor mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning\nmethod (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT\n(Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer\nlearning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on\nsegmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric\nCT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a\ncommercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides\nactionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments\nreveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned\nwith pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation,\nespecially when segmenting fine structures-and that continual learning\nstrategies mitigate institutional shifts, thus enhancing generalization across\ndiverse pediatric datasets.

Instead, the inherent serial\ndependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar\neffects, can be leveraged.

In such\na stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary\nprocesses fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a\nstrategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,\nmatching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly\ncriterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the\ntheoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as\nlong as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the\ngeneralized Kelly criterion in the experimental market.

We integrate the\nmechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its\napplication through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges.\nThe automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify\nvulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly\nspecify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus\nsystematically manage vulnerability postures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f00\u6e90\u5b89\u5168\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u6307\u5b9a\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u5e76\u7ba1\u7406\u6f0f\u6d1e\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u6f0f\u6d1e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity\nand structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with\nparticular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial\nobstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node\nidentification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node\nidentification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes:\ncentrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network\ncontrol, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review\nbridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods\nbased on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by\nhighlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different\nnetwork types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by\nidentifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time\nevaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and\ncomputational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis\nconsolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in\nmodeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine\nlearning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for\ncomplex systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u4e03\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u53ca\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u901a\u7528\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e03\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5982\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

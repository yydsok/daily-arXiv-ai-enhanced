However,\nrecent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic\naccuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training\nenvironment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning\nmethods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they\noften struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the\ntraining setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of\ndisease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and\nenvironment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative\nto task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning\nframework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),\ngrounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a\nlimited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and\nleverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess\nTMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset\ncomprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21\ndiseases and healthy instances across three crop species.

In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,\nvarious objects must be transported through the same environment.

We address this by using a library of past\nsolutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a\nnew, previously unseen object.

Recently, MARL\nmodels, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep\nQ-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging\nsequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance\nperformance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in\nwhich agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action\nDecisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which\nagents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive\nexperiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\nbenchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model\noutperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL."}

At the same time, modern deep\nRL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.\nWhile pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its\nrole in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first\ntheoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in\nstate-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and\ncategorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise\npruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the\npolicy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret\ndecomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced\nperformance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental\nperformance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and\nmicro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong\npolicy-aware adversaries.

To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences.

In this paper, we systematically revisit\ncooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and\nidentify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends\nto explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading\nthe system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions\nv.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel\napproach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),\nwhich progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game\nequilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a\nmore optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a\nsuboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and\ntwo synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Here, we develop AMORE,\nAdaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator\ncapable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring\nreliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states\nfrom given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within\nthe framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize\nthe loss function.

We show that under uniform weighting, the TE\nvanishes asymptotically with a $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas\ndiscounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount\nfactor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step.

To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first\nmethod capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in\nreal-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera\nmodels, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary\nspinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor\ninconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and\nanchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%\ncompared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing\napproaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles\na wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked\nautonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics."}

RockNet leverages all devices for\ndistributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need\nminimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and\nefficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes\nthe communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.\nHardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate\nRockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks\nfrom scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network\nmicrocontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture\nreduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when\nscaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight\nintegration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication\nenables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with\nstate-of-the-art accuracy."}

To address this\nstorage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system\ndesigned to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded\nmobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log.

To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that\noptimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method\nparameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets\nand scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric\nregularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing\nneuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.\nThis approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a\nway to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond\nconventional pixel-based methods."}

We find that VLA-0 is not only\neffective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0\noutperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating\nVLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,\nincluding $\\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without\nlarge-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on\nlarge-scale robotic data, like $\\pi_0.5$-KI, $\\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.\nThese findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms\nSmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper\nsummarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques\nrequired to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.\nVisual results, code, and trained models are provided here:\nhttps://vla0.github.io/."}

We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation\ngenerated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization\nsequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To\neffectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a\ncompositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize\nthe continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.\nSubsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to\nlearn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive\nexperiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass\nPrediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art static baselines.

One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety\ndatasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.\nInference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:\nexcessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed\ndue to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nto reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical\nimage regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the\nassessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are\nsafe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments.

PMLR. 2020, pp. 8927-8963) addressed this by\nallocating model rewards, which are non-monetary and freely replicable, based\non the Shapley value of each party's data contribution, measured via\ninformation gain. In this paper, we introduce a ratio-based Shapley value that\nreplaces the standard additive formulation with a relative contribution\nmeasure. While our overall reward framework, including the incentive\ndefinitions and model-reward setting, remains aligned with that of Sim and\ncolleagues, the underlying value function is fundamentally different. Our\nalternative valuation induces a different distribution of model rewards and\noffers a new lens through which to analyze incentive properties. We formally\ndefine the ratio-based value and prove that it satisfies the same set of\nincentive conditions as the additive formulation, including adapted versions of\nfairness, individual rationality, and stability. Like the original approach,\nour method faces the same fundamental trade-offs between these incentives. Our\ncontribution is a mathematically grounded alternative to the additive Shapley\nframework, potentially better suited to contexts where proportionality among\ncontributors is more meaningful than additive differences."}

This algorithm\nachieves a regret that is $O(\\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible\nto clustering.

The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making.

Our analysis reveals\nthat LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.\nAlthough they are generally self-consistent and confident about the\nintermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are\nmainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal\nreasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and\nintegrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery\napproach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with\ncausal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,\nmechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings."}

(2) From each\nmalware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics.\nSince the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity\nchecking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique\nthat produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly\nitems and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from\nthe malware's assembly code.

To address\nthis issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a\nrepresentation for guiding video generation models to enhance their\nphysics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper\nsupervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance\nmotivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to\nphysical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation\nmodels to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for\nimproving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,\nproving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging\nphysical scenarios.

Despite this progress, their adversarial\nrobustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial\npatch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first\nintroduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic\nadversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the\ncamera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making.

Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN\naugmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with\nPLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by\nanalyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images.

Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph\nconstruction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of\ncurrent state-of-the-art ViGs.

This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian\ncovariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal\nestimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural\nM-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime,\nindependent of the underlying distribution. Numerical experiments show that\nthis estimator performs very well, and that Tyler's iterative procedure\nconverges quickly to the estimator. Franks and Moitra recently provided the\nfirst distribution-free error bounds in the finite sample setting, as well as\nthe first rigorous convergence analysis of Tyler's iterative procedure.\nHowever, their results exceed the sample complexity of the Gaussian setting by\na $\\log^{2} d$ factor. We close this gap by proving optimal sample threshold\nand error bounds for Tyler's M-estimator for all Elliptical distributions,\nfully matching the Gaussian result. Moreover, we recover the algorithmic\nconvergence even at this lower sample threshold. Our approach builds on the\noperator scaling connection of Franks and Moitra by introducing a novel\npseudorandom condition, which we call $\\infty$-expansion. We show that\nElliptical distributions satisfy $\\infty$-expansion at the optimal sample\nthreshold, and then prove a novel scaling result for inputs satisfying this\ncondition."}

Specifically, we propose RECODE, an\nagentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce\nthe input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful\nreconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only\ntransforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,\nbut also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On\nvarious visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,\nRECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use\ncode for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping.

This\nchallenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private\nand may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party\nverification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later\nverification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and\nrely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and\nnon-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight\nwatermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the\ndiffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation\nprocess. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is\nhighly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to\nuse cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing\nthe seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark\nremoval. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating\nefficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access\nto model weights."}

The cooperative behavior\ncan be influenced by the environmental noise in partially observable settings\nand by the decision-making strategies of agents, which may incorporate not only\nreputation but also traits such as generosity and forgiveness. Traditional\nsimulations often assume fully random interactions, where cooperation is tested\nbetween randomly selected agent pairs. In this paper, we investigate\ncooperation dynamics using the concept of Stephen Wolfram's one-dimensional\nbinary cellular automata. This approach allows us to explore how cooperation\nevolves when interactions are limited to neighboring agents. We define binary\ncellular automata rules that conform to the donation game mechanics.\nAdditionally, we introduce models of perceptual and action noise, along with a\nmutation matrix governing the probabilistic evolution of agent strategies. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that cooperation is significantly affected by\nagents' mobility and their spatial locality on the game board.

In both settings, agents can\nsense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly\nthan via simple Brownian motion.\n  For the first variant of the model, we present simulation results to show the\nbehavior of agents under our locomotion model, as well as {analytical results}\nto bound the time it takes for the agents to reach the cancer site.

However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically\nbuilt with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability\nto capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a\npermutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based\nsurrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study\ndeveloped a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U\nNet-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate\npredictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming\ntimesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model\ntemporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample\nmechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'\ncontact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements\nin computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN\nmodel was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot\nforming case study using aluminium alloys.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory.

Materials and\nMethods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random\nforest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,\nSurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an\nattention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.\nPerformance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key\npredictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved\nthe highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)\nand baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by\ndynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative\nclinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most\ncontributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone\ndisorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most\nimpactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention\nmechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential\nnature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher\naccuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical\nadoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based\ntemporal models into hospital planning workflows.

Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and\nperformance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end\nusers, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CoNav Chair\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eROS\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f6e\u6905\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u907f\u969c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u6b21\u6570\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u548c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6b8b\u75be\u4eba\u53e3\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6d3b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u878d\u5408\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoNav Chair\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eROS\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u907f\u969c\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc721\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cd\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\uff09\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5171\u4eab\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5f0f\u78b0\u649e\u6b21\u6570\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u548c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "CoNav\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6b8b\u75be\u7528\u6237\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive\ntraining of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial\ncomputational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm.

First, in a preliminary experiment, we\nevaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective\nmodel and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main\nexperiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and\nanalyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness\nfollowing a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to\ninvestigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents\nwith higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal\ncloseness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a\nvalid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the\nmechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a\nfoundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4eb2\u5bc6\u611f\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e2d\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u8bdd\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4eb2\u5bc6\u611f\u3002", "result": "\u4ef7\u503c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4eb2\u5bc6\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-VFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002ST-VFM\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u7a7a\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u65f6\u7a7a\u6d41\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u540e\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u9884VFM\u548c\u540eVFM\uff09\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-VFM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-VFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Then, based on the overview\nof the existing data collection paradigm and learning framework, three key\nchallenges restricting the development of dexterous robotic manipulation are\nsummarized and discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ece\u673a\u68b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u5230\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u524d\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e09\u5927\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0cAI\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6536\u96c6\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u7075\u5de7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7075\u5de7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Like other single deep\nregressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to\nperform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network\nis typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In\norder to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with\nseveral expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset\nwith a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its\nrestoration performance for a particular quality range.

As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators\nwhere the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression\ntask.

Investigating a notebook via re-execution\noften is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software\ndependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks.

Most existing\napproaches condition generative models on physical descriptions of a room, such\nas its size, shape, and surface materials. However, this reliance on geometric\ninformation limits their usability in scenarios where the room layout is\nunknown or when perceptual realism (how a space sounds to a listener) is more\nimportant than strict physical accuracy. In this study, we propose an\nalternative strategy: conditioning RIR generation directly on a set of RIR\nacoustic parameters. These parameters include various measures of reverberation\ntime and direct sound to reverberation ratio, both broadband and bandwise. By\nspecifying how the space should sound instead of how it should look, our method\nenables more flexible and perceptually driven RIR generation.

Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on\nsingle-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information\nloss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these\nmethods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,\nspeaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing\nvoice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our\nnew audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end\ntraining of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves\nsuperior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless\ncompression.

This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate\nand respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional\ndecoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions\nthat overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to\nthe AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural\nNetwork-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which\nenables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents\nmay react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in\nstructured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI\nsampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior.

Using the\ngenerative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a\nsingle-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed\nwhile maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible\napplication of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the\nautonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently\nsample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to\ninform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner\ndemonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the\nbaseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u8def\u53e3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u901a\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u53c9\u8def\u53e3\uff09\u662f\u78b0\u649e\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec31000\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u78b0\u649e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u5176\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5355\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Designing intelligent systems with\nhuman-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial\nintelligence community.

However, unreliable travel times on\nsidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure\nconditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the\nrobust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for\ntravel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is\nintegrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian\nflows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three\ndifferent approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,\nellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a\ndistributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A\nrealistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center\nis used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot\ndesigns and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a\nconventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability\nunder variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches\noutperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of\naverage and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust\napproaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for\nsidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative\nnavigation behaviors.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the\nnumerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead\nobserves preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices\nbeing compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we\npresent a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{HSAT})$ for\nepisodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per\nepisode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is\nthe number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret\nlower bound of $\\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda\nscores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$.

To address this, we introduce\nTree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual\ntrees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with\nan instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them\nusing a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified\ntrunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS\nsignals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of\nindividual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less\nthan 20\\% of the planting distance.

However,\naccording to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components\nare vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling\nlayers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers.

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively.

For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset.

In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684LiDAR\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08LGL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5UniLGL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5b8c\u6574\u70b9\u4e91\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6750\u8d28\uff09\u5230BEV\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u6216\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u8d28LiDAR\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86LGL\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6BEV\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591aBEV\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUniLGL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u5982\u5361\u8f66\u548c\u5fae\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u591a\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLGL\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LGL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional generative\nmodels based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time\nrequirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can\neffectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature\nof AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher\ndemands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing\nenvironments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC\nmodel switching for the first time.

Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as\ndomain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and\nsemantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,\nexisting methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which\nmay hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source\nbatch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by\nunrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,\nignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable\nsemantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting\n(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.\nSpecifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and\nVisual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for\nalignment.

Hebbian learning\npresents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies\non local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for\nlearning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of\nattributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,\nthus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules\nacross all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the\ncurse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian\nlearning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive\nprior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This\nwork demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,\nresulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved\nswarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning\nrules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in\nstandard benchmarking tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHebbian\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Hebbian\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5207\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cHebbian\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "Hebbian\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u7fa4\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their performance has mostly been tested\nin the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or\nabdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more\nchallenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue.

The first part examines the\nproperties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,\nemphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It\nproposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including\nregularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to\nstabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second\npart focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency\nby integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,\nguided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents\nsmoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need\nfor labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and\ncomputational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP\ntasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform\ntraditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency.

To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly\ndiscovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios.

However, their entangled latent space and\nlack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting\ntechniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to\ndominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that\nnaturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the\ndenoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of\nseparately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that\nlower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across\nheterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,\nregion-specific style control.

First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings\nwith a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a\nface recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the\nID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text\ncondition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention\nmodule in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features\nto find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while\nachieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized\nportraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ID-EA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8096\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dTextual Inversion\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "ID-EA\u5305\u542bID-Enhancer\u548cID-Adapter\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672cID\u951a\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3UNet\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "ID-EA\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u7ea615\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ID-EA\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8096\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly\npredict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,\nadvocating a \"First Reasoning, Then Forecasting\" strategy that explicitly\nincorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.\nTo achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention\nreasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)\nscheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a\nunified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through\na query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,\na compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within\nthe given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform\npolicy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing\nvaluable priors for subsequent trajectory generation.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic\nsegmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we\napply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in single-scale settings.

(2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from\na fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the\ndesign of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.\nIn contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control\nsettings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with\na shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative\nmodel of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch\nsetting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only\n$\\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a\ngenerative model jumps to $\\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the\nsubstantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key\nquestion in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration\ninherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable\nRL even possible?\n  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular\nMDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our\nmain result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging\nthe gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a\nmatching $\\tilde{\\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under\nthe common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in\nthe episodic setting of $\\tilde{\\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of\nour algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u975e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u663e\u8457\u969c\u788d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a$\tilde{O}(S^2A)$\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728$\tilde{O}(S^2A)$\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u975e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u663e\u8457\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002"}}

Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert\nannotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common\nmethod is data augmentation.

Our analysis is general and\nbroadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by\nstochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.\nComprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nderived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ece\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53d8\u91cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u754c\u9650\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684CL\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u56de\u653e\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,\nexisting NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on\nsingle-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view\ndata, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view\nlevel, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel\nclasses, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into\nview-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted\nfusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known\nclasses based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel\nclass learning.

Using this,\nit is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong\npredictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this\nnew tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and\narrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the\nactivation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise\nwhen the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic\npermutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a\ncontinuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings\ncorroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended\ninductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of\notherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69).

Inspired by the strong power of\nOut-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric\nframework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision\ninto fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:\n(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)\nadditional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into\nsegmentation networks without any modification on the architectures.

A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We\nbelieve that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,\nand applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the\ntranslational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e8610\u79cd\u65e9\u671f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763EEG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08EEG-FMs\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763EEG\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u76d1\u7763EEG-FMs\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524dEEG-FMs\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8EEG-FMs\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Indeed, this was a\nprimary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early\ndays of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed\nthis skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows\nthat sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit\nwell-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This\nsuccess has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model\nfor learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of\nrequired iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We\nargue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another\nperspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the\noptimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative\nproperties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will\nencode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class\nof models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of\nencoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community\nshould aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as\naim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain\nproperties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their\nconvergence rates.

Specifically, we generate bilateral grids\ncontaining MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique\ntransformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on\nspatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid\ndecomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types\nstored in separate subgrids.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism.

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient\nway for hybrid rice breeding.

However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic\nprediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the\nmodels to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,\nwhich remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we\nproposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice\nbreeding.

Therefore, we developed a parametric dual\nprojection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual\nanalysis.

By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs\nconstructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce\nthe sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \\log A)$ timesteps,\nwhere $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend\nthese results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a\nPAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with\nshowing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against\nprior work in an experimental setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684PAC\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u539f\u59cbMDP\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3O(SA log A)\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u4e24\u70b9\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5176\u90bb\u8fd1\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u59cbMDP\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u539f\u59cbMDP\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230O(SA log A)\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

To appear in Proc. MIDL 2025 (PMLR)", "summary": "Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image\nregions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical\nimaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely\non discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that\ngenerative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can\nachieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior\nassumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,\ndomain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms\ndomain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with\nmIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings\nhighlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding\ntasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),\na novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify\nregions of high certainty.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers.

Our experiments reveal that\nthe safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous\ncapabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the\nSafety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve\nas an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation\nfor developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards.

Existing IoU-based losses\noften incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's\nnon-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.\nHowever, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,\noften leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired\nbehaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU\nobjective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss\nfunction that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the\nIoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to\nbridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides\nmeaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box\nenlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties.

However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for\npricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and\nscale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing\n(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these\nchallenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic\nInformation Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract\nessential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from\nSaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,\nencompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's\neffectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps.

Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including\nboth value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems\nsuch as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state\ndiagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both\nnoiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric\nthat balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational\nefficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first\nreveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational\nclassifiers.

This paper\npresents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding\nncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for\nlarge sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs\ntotaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from\napproximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary\nsamples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on\ngenomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence\nas input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do\nnot need transcriptomics data.

However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced\npackaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of\nthe layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables\nthe imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective\nin NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This\nconversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for\nmagnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy\ncurrent effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we\npresent a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample\nscanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.\nThe SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by\naligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect\nusing both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)\nmagnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment\nof the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an\ninversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by\nintegrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM\nimproves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.\nAlso, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a\nreal image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial\nanalysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\uff08SPIM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5148\u8fdb\u5c01\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08NDT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5148\u8fdb\u5c01\u88c5\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eFFT\u7684\u78c1\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u6da1\u6d41\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "SPIM\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u78c1\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5229\u7528I/Q\u901a\u9053\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u9510\u5229\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u3001\u78c1\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u7ea0\u6b63\u626b\u63cf\u9519\u4f4d\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u5408\u6bd5\u5965-\u8428\u4f10\u5c14\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0eFFT\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SPIM\u5c06I\u901a\u9053\u9510\u5ea6\u63d0\u53470.3%\uff0cQ\u901a\u9053\u9510\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e25%\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u5b9e\u9645\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d0.30\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u9519\u4f4d\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "SPIM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5c01\u88c5NDT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner.

More to the point, it is generally unclear what to\nexpect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches\nare promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)\nfor micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational\nmicromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct\nan FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods\nand show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with\n\\emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast\nconstraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions\non the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the\ngeometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is\nsharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical\nempowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we\nconstruct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the\nobtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the\nbasic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers.

Our\ntreatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates\ncan be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and\ncan lead to different global behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edfClarify\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Disambiguator\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u8def\u7531\u6620\u5c04\u548cACL\uff09\u65f6\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u6a21\u7cca\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faClarify\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cDisambiguator\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u5408\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\uff0cClarify\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "Clarify\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

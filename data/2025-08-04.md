### [1] [Multi-Agent Game Generation and Evaluation via Audio-Visual Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00632)
*Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了AVR-Eval评估指标和AVR-Agent多智能体系统，用于生成和评估交互式音视频内容，发现其优于单次生成内容，但在利用定制资源和反馈方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI在生成复杂交互式音视频内容（如视频游戏）时缺乏自动化评估指标和难以处理多模态资源的挑战。

Method: 提出AVR-Eval评估指标，通过全模态模型比较音视频内容质量；开发AVR-Agent多智能体系统，从多媒体资源库生成JavaScript代码并迭代优化。

Result: AVR-Agent生成的内容在实验中显著优于单次生成内容，但在利用定制资源和音视频反馈方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在利用高质量资源和反馈方面与人类存在差距，揭示了机器与人类内容创作方式的根本差异。

Abstract: While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating
interactive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging.
Current LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated
evaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires
teams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets
made by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a
multi-agent system.
  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using
Audio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,
and audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing
evaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies
good from broken or mismatched content.
  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a
bank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects
relevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify
the best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback
from the AVR.
  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content
A against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly
higher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,
models struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing
no higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from
high-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not
seem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental
differences between human and machine content creation approaches.

### [2] [Rethinking Evidence Hierarchies in Medical Language Benchmarks: A Critical Evaluation of HealthBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00081)
*Fred Mutisya,Shikoh Gitau,Nasubo Ongoma,Keith Mbae,Elizabeth Wamicha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthBench用于评估AI医疗语言模型，但依赖专家意见可能引入偏见。作者提出基于临床实践指南（CPGs）的改进方案，以增强全球适用性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HealthBench的局限性在于依赖专家意见而非高质量临床证据，可能导致偏见，尤其在低收入地区。非洲背景下的数据稀缺和基础设施不足加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出基于版本控制CPGs的奖励函数，结合系统评价和GRADE证据评级，通过证据加权评分和上下文覆盖逻辑改进评估。

Result: 改进方案旨在提升医疗语言模型的临床可信度、伦理合规性和全球适用性。

Conclusion: 通过结合CPGs和透明性，改进后的方法有望生成更可靠、公平的医疗AI模型。

Abstract: HealthBench, a benchmark designed to measure the capabilities of AI systems
for health better (Arora et al., 2025), has advanced medical language model
evaluation through physician-crafted dialogues and transparent rubrics.
However, its reliance on expert opinion, rather than high-tier clinical
evidence, risks codifying regional biases and individual clinician
idiosyncrasies, further compounded by potential biases in automated grading
systems. These limitations are particularly magnified in low- and middle-income
settings, where issues like sparse neglected tropical disease coverage and
region-specific guideline mismatches are prevalent.
  The unique challenges of the African context, including data scarcity,
inadequate infrastructure, and nascent regulatory frameworks, underscore the
urgent need for more globally relevant and equitable benchmarks. To address
these shortcomings, we propose anchoring reward functions in version-controlled
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that incorporate systematic reviews and
GRADE evidence ratings.
  Our roadmap outlines "evidence-robust" reinforcement learning via
rubric-to-guideline linkage, evidence-weighted scoring, and contextual override
logic, complemented by a focus on ethical considerations and the integration of
delayed outcome feedback. By re-grounding rewards in rigorously vetted CPGs,
while preserving HealthBench's transparency and physician engagement, we aim to
foster medical language models that are not only linguistically polished but
also clinically trustworthy, ethically sound, and globally relevant.

### [3] [Hyperproperty-Constrained Secure Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00106)
*Ernest Bonnah,Luan Viet Nguyen,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于HyperTWTL的安全强化学习方法（SecRL），通过动态Boltzmann softmax RL学习满足HyperTWTL约束的安全最优策略，并在机器人任务中验证了其有效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中，虽然时间逻辑约束的安全强化学习（SRL）已有较多探索，但利用超属性（hyperproperties）研究安全感知强化学习（RL）仍存在显著空白。

Method: 将智能体的动态建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并将不透明性/安全约束形式化为HyperTWTL，提出了一种动态Boltzmann softmax RL方法。

Result: 通过机器人取送任务案例验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，且优于两种基线RL算法。

Conclusion: HyperTWTL约束的安全强化学习方法在机器人应用中表现出色，填补了相关研究空白。

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a
domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in
compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for
robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure
reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe
reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several
existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring
security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the
dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security
constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning
security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while
satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our
proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission
case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms,
showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

### [4] [No AI Without PI! Object-Centric Process Mining as the Enabler for Generative, Predictive, and Prescriptive Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00116)
*Wil M. P. van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI在工业环境中的应用挑战，提出通过对象中心过程挖掘（OCPM）实现AI落地，并引入过程智能（PI）概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在端到端操作流程中应用困难的问题，强调过程数据的重要性。

Method: 结合对象中心过程挖掘（OCPM）与生成、预测和规范性AI，提出过程智能（PI）框架。

Result: OCPM是连接数据和过程的关键，PI能有效支持AI在组织环境中的应用。

Conclusion: AI需结合PI和OCPM才能优化操作流程，为工业AI应用提供新方向。

Abstract: The uptake of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts the way we work, interact,
do business, and conduct research. However, organizations struggle to apply AI
successfully in industrial settings where the focus is on end-to-end
operational processes. Here, we consider generative, predictive, and
prescriptive AI and elaborate on the challenges of diagnosing and improving
such processes. We show that AI needs to be grounded using Object-Centric
Process Mining (OCPM). Process-related data are structured and
organization-specific and, unlike text, processes are often highly dynamic.
OCPM is the missing link connecting data and processes and enables different
forms of AI. We use the term Process Intelligence (PI) to refer to the
amalgamation of process-centric data-driven techniques able to deal with a
variety of object and event types, enabling AI in an organizational context.
This paper explains why AI requires PI to improve operational processes and
highlights opportunities for successfully combining OCPM and generative,
predictive, and prescriptive AI.

### [5] [Algorithmic Detection of Rank Reversals, Transitivity Violations, and Decomposition Inconsistencies in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00129)
*Agustín Borda,Juan Bautista Cabral,Gonzalo Giarda,Diego Nicolás Gimenez Irusta,Paula Pacheco,Alvaro Roy Schachner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种检测多准则决策分析中排名反转问题的测试方法，并在Scikit-Criteria库中实现。讨论了实现中的挑战及设计考虑，强调了这些方法对评估决策方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排名反转是多准则决策分析中的严重问题，影响决策结果的准确性，因此需要一种机制来评估方法的性能。

Method: 提出了三种测试方法，并在Scikit-Criteria库中实现，讨论了实现中的挑战和设计考虑。

Result: 成功实现了检测排名反转的测试方法，并解决了通用场景中的实现问题。

Conclusion: 这些测试方法在评估多准则决策方法的有效性中具有重要作用。

Abstract: In Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Rank Reversals are a serious problem
that can greatly affect the results of a Multi-Criteria Decision Method against
a particular set of alternatives. It is therefore useful to have a mechanism
that allows one to measure the performance of a method on a set of
alternatives. This idea could be taken further to build a global ranking of the
effectiveness of different methods to solve a problem. In this paper, we
present three tests that detect the presence of Rank Reversals, along with
their implementation in the Scikit-Criteria library. We also address the
complications that arise when implementing these tests for general scenarios
and the design considerations we made to handle them. We close with a
discussion about how these additions could play a major role in the judgment of
multi-criteria decision methods for problem solving.

### [6] [SHACL Validation under Graph Updates (Extended Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00137)
*Shqiponja Ahmetaj,George Konstantinidis,Magdalena Ortiz,Paolo Pareti,Mantas Simkus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究SHACL在RDF图更新时的验证问题，提出一种基于SHACL的更新语言，并通过回归技术将静态验证问题转化为SHACL约束的（不）可满足性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RDF图在更新时如何保持SHACL规范的验证有效性，为动态RDF图提供进一步推理服务的基础。

Method: 提出基于SHACL的更新语言，利用回归技术将更新动作嵌入SHACL约束，分析静态验证问题的计算复杂性。

Result: 证明静态验证问题可转化为SHACL约束的（不）可满足性问题，并分析了计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 通过原型实现验证了方法的可行性，为动态RDF图的静态分析提供了工具支持。

Abstract: SHACL (SHApe Constraint Language) is a W3C standardized constraint language
for RDF graphs. In this paper, we study SHACL validation in RDF graphs under
updates. We present a SHACL-based update language that can capture intuitive
and realistic modifications on RDF graphs and study the problem of static
validation under such updates. This problem asks to verify whether every graph
that validates a SHACL specification will still do so after applying a given
update sequence. More importantly, it provides a basis for further services for
reasoning about evolving RDF graphs. Using a regression technique that embeds
the update actions into SHACL constraints, we show that static validation under
updates can be reduced to (un)satisfiability of constraints in (a minor
extension of) SHACL. We analyze the computational complexity of the static
validation problem for SHACL and some key fragments. Finally, we present a
prototype implementation that performs static validation and other static
analysis tasks on SHACL constraints and demonstrate its behavior through
preliminary experiments.

### [7] [Co-Producing AI: Toward an Augmented, Participatory Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00138)
*Rashid Mushkani,Hugo Berard,Toumadher Ammar,Cassandre Chatonnier,Shin Koseki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于设计正义和参与式AI的AI生命周期重构方法，强调共同生产、多样性、公平和包容（DEI），以减轻AI对边缘化群体的负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种方法试图减轻AI算法的风险和偏见，但这些算法仍对文化边缘化群体产生不成比例的影响。因此，需要重新设计AI生产流程以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种增强的AI生命周期，包含五个相互关联的阶段：共同框架、共同设计、共同实施、共同部署和共同维护。该方法基于四个多学科研讨会，并强调分布式权威和迭代知识交换。

Result: 论文将提出的生命周期与多个主要伦理框架联系起来，并概述了扩展参与式治理的关键研究问题。

Conclusion: 通过重新设计AI生命周期，强调共同生产和多学科合作，可以有效减轻AI对边缘化群体的负面影响，但仍需进一步研究以扩展参与式治理。

Abstract: Despite efforts to mitigate the inherent risks and biases of artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms, these algorithms can disproportionately impact
culturally marginalized groups. A range of approaches has been proposed to
address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines
and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote
algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and
recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms
requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This
re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and
multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle
consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design,
co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed
by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed
authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed
lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research
questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.

### [8] [Theory of Mind Using Active Inference: A Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00401)
*Riddhi J. Pitliya,Ozan Catal,Toon Van de Maele,Corrado Pezzato,Tim Verbelen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于心智理论（ToM）的多智能体协作方法，通过主动推理实现，无需任务特定的共享生成模型或显式通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体协作中如何理解并推理其他智能体的信念和目标的问题，避免依赖特定任务模型或显式通信。

Method: 扩展了基于推理树的规划算法，通过递归推理探索联合策略空间，智能体维护自身和他人的信念与目标的独立表示。

Result: 在避碰和觅食任务中，ToM智能体表现出更好的协作能力，减少了碰撞和冗余努力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推动了人工智能的实际应用，还为心智理论提供了计算层面的新见解。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to multi-agent cooperation by implementing theory
of mind (ToM) within active inference. ToM - the ability to understand that
others can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about
others' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active
inference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on
task-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,
while being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains
distinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend
the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically
explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is
evaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results
demonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM
counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.
Crucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from
observable behaviour. This work advances practical applications in artificial
intelligence while providing computational insights into ToM.

### [9] [Beyond Agreement: Rethinking Ground Truth in Educational AI Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00143)
*Danielle R. Thomas,Conrad Borchers,Kenneth R. Koedinger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张过度依赖人类评分者间一致性（IRR）会阻碍教育数据分类的进展，提出五种补充评估方法以提高数据标注质量和模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类评分者存在偏见和不可靠性，传统IRR指标无法充分保证标注数据的有效性，尤其是在教育AI应用中。

Method: 提出五种替代方法，包括多标签标注方案、专家评估和闭环验证等，强调外部效度的重要性。

Result: 这些方法能生成更有效的训练数据和模型，提升学生学习效果和可操作性洞察。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考标注质量和“真实标准”，优先考虑效度和教育影响，而非仅依赖评分者共识。

Abstract: Humans can be notoriously imperfect evaluators. They are often biased,
unreliable, and unfit to define "ground truth." Yet, given the surging need to
produce large amounts of training data in educational applications using AI,
traditional inter-rater reliability (IRR) metrics like Cohen's kappa remain
central to validating labeled data. IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine
learning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification
of tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded
assessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a
gatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways
that are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address
this issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,
such as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and
close-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better
position to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved
student learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We
also emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by
establishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it
works across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints). We call
on the field to rethink annotation quality and ground truth--prioritizing
validity and educational impact over consensus alone.

### [10] [Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00159)
*Jobst Heitzig,Ram Potham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过设计AI目标函数来平衡人类与AI的权力，以促进安全和福祉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在AI系统中平衡权力，确保人类福祉和安全，避免权力失衡带来的风险。

Method: 采用部分公理化方法，设计了一个可参数化和分解的目标函数，考虑人类有限理性和社会规范，并通过反向归纳或多智能体强化学习计算该指标。

Result: 在多种情境下验证了该指标的效果，表明其可能比直接基于效用的目标更安全。

Conclusion: 软最大化人类权力指标可能是AI系统的有益目标，比直接效用目标更安全。

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal,
sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI
interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the
ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by
forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance
between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially
axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective
function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of
human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social
norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or
approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given
world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric
in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental
sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly
maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a
beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct
utility-based objectives.

### [11] [RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00222)
*Yihong Dong,Xue Jiang,Yongding Tao,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Lili Mou,Rongyu Cao,Yingwei Ma,Jue Chen,Binhua Li,Zhi Jin,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-PLUS通过结合内部探索与外部数据，解决了RLVR方法在LLMs中的能力边界问题，显著提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法因策略固有性和稀疏奖励难以突破基础LLM的能力边界，甚至导致能力边界崩溃。

Method: RL-PLUS结合多重重要性采样和探索优势函数，优化推理路径。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和六个分布外任务中表现优异，平均提升21.1%至69.2%。

Conclusion: RL-PLUS有效解决了能力边界崩溃问题，并在多任务中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly
advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of
the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense
action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability
boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this
problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal
exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve
stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models.
RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address
for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based
Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning
paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results
show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing
RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance
on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and
significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative
improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across
multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability
boundary collapse problem.

### [12] [MetaAgent: Toward Self-Evolving Agent via Tool Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00271)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaAgent是一个基于学习-实践原则的智能代理，通过持续自我改进和工具学习提升任务解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一个能够通过实践和自我反思不断改进的智能代理，以解决知识发现中的挑战。

Method: MetaAgent从基础能力出发，通过生成帮助请求、自我反思和工具学习逐步提升，同时构建内部工具和知识库。

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalkerQA和BrowseCamp等基准测试中，MetaAgent表现优于基线方法，并匹配或超越端到端训练的代理。

Conclusion: MetaAgent展示了自进化代理系统在知识发现中的潜力，无需调整模型参数或额外训练即可持续改进。

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our
source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Chunhui Zhang,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文比较了人类和LLM（GPT-4o）在任务生成中的差异，发现人类受心理驱动因素影响，而LLM生成的任务缺乏社交性和实体性，偏向抽象。尽管LLM的任务被认为更有趣和新颖，但其与人类认知存在核心差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式代理（如LLM）是否能模拟人类基于心理驱动的复杂任务生成行为。

Method: 通过任务生成实验，比较人类和GPT-4o的响应，分析心理驱动因素（如个人价值观和认知风格）的影响。

Result: 人类任务生成受心理驱动因素影响，而LLM生成的任务缺乏社交性和实体性，偏向抽象。LLM的任务被认为更有趣和新颖，但与人类认知不符。

Conclusion: LLM与人类认知存在核心差距，需在设计更符合人类行为的代理时融入内在动机和实体基础。

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal
motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)
aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they
operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a
task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent
(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by
psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and
cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided
to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They
produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically
biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived
as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic
proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude
that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human
cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of
more human-aligned agents.

*Jianyi Zhang,Xu Ji,Ziyin Zhou,Yuchen Zhou,Shubo Shi,Haoyu Wu,Zhen Li,Shizhao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasonBench是首个专注于结构化图形推理任务的评估基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂图形推理中的表现，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并提出双重优化策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注简单图形，而VLMs在复杂图形推理和抽象问题解决方面表现不足，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出ReasonBench基准，包含1,613个现实智力测试问题，涵盖位置、属性、数量和多元素任务，并评估11种主流VLMs。提出DiaCoT和ReasonTune双重优化策略。

Result: 当前VLMs在复杂推理任务中存在显著局限性。双重优化策略使模型性能提升33.5%。

Conclusion: ReasonBench为VLM评估提供了新工具，双重优化策略显著提升了模型性能，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of visual language models (VLMs) in graphic
reasoning tasks has become an important research topic. However, VLMs still
show obvious deficiencies in simulating human-level graphic reasoning
capabilities, especially in complex graphic reasoning and abstract problem
solving, which are less studied and existing studies only focus on simple
graphics. To evaluate the performance of VLMs in complex graphic reasoning, we
propose ReasonBench, the first evaluation benchmark focused on structured
graphic reasoning tasks, which includes 1,613 questions from real-world
intelligence tests. ReasonBench covers reasoning dimensions related to
location, attribute, quantity, and multi-element tasks, providing a
comprehensive evaluation of the performance of VLMs in spatial, relational, and
abstract reasoning capabilities. We benchmark 11 mainstream VLMs (including
closed-source and open-source models) and reveal significant limitations of
current models. Based on these findings, we propose a dual optimization
strategy: Diagrammatic Reasoning Chain (DiaCoT) enhances the interpretability
of reasoning by decomposing layers, and ReasonTune enhances the task
adaptability of model reasoning through training, all of which improves VLM
performance by 33.5\%. All experimental data and code are in the repository:

*Yeonjun In,Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R1-Act是一种简单高效的后训练方法，通过结构化推理过程显式触发安全知识，显著提升大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在执行复杂任务时表现出色，但容易被滥用执行有害指令，引发安全隐患。研究发现模型已具备足够的安全知识，但在推理过程中未能激活。

Method: 提出R1-Act方法，通过结构化推理显式触发安全知识，仅需少量训练数据和计算资源。

Result: R1-Act在多个LRM模型上显著提升安全性，且不影响推理性能，优于现有对齐方法。

Conclusion: R1-Act是一种高效、可扩展且实用的方法，为解决LRM的安全问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models
frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety
concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety
risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail
to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a
simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety
knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety
improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior
alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90
minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across
multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and
practical efficiency of our approach.

*Shixin Yi,Lin Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRGI框架通过引入视觉验证机制，改进了视觉语言模型中的推理过程，减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought提示方法在视觉语言模型中产生的解释缺乏视觉内容的基础，导致幻觉问题。

Method: CoRGI采用三阶段流程：生成文本推理链、提取视觉证据、综合文本与视觉证据生成验证答案。

Result: 在VCR基准测试中，CoRGI提升了Qwen-2.5VL和LLaVA-1.6模型的推理性能，并得到更事实性和有帮助的解释。

Conclusion: 视觉证据对增强多模态推理的鲁棒性至关重要，CoRGI展示了验证机制的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual
evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理系统多为闭源或依赖付费API，限制了研究的可访问性和可复现性，因此需要开源解决方案。

Method: 通过系统研究高质量训练数据的构建（查询、轨迹和可验证答案），并探索代理测试时的反思和投票策略。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试中，8B参数的开源模型超越了WebDancer和WebSailor等系统，成为性能领先的免费代理。

Conclusion: Cognitive Kernel-Pro为开源AI代理设立了新标准，推动了可访问的高性能AI代理的发展。

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for
the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web
interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current
agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid
APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the
research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a
fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework
designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.
Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of
high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the
construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our
8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as
WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for
accessible, high-capability AI agents. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学领域的应用，特别是形式化数学证明中的挑战，分析了其与编程任务的差异，并提出了三个核心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在形式化数学证明中的表现，揭示其与编程任务的差异，并探索模型在逻辑推理中的局限性。

Method: 通过分析现有模型和基准测试，探讨形式化与非形式化数学训练领域的权衡、证明生成脆弱性的原因，以及LLMs是否真正表示逻辑状态。

Result: 发现形式化数学证明比代码合成更具挑战性，LLMs在逻辑状态表示上可能仅停留在模仿层面。

Conclusion: 论文旨在明确当前技术的局限性，并提出未来可能的研究方向，而非划定硬性边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in structured
reasoning and symbolic tasks, with coding emerging as a particular area of
strength. This success has sparked growing interest in applying LLMs to
mathematics, both in informal problem-solving and formal theorem proving.
However, progress in formal mathematics has proven to be significantly more
difficult, despite surface-level similarities between programming and proof
construction. This discrepancy raises important questions about how LLMs
``reason'', how they are supervised, and whether they internally track a notion
of computational or deductive state. In this article, we address the
state-of-the-art of the discipline, focusing on recent models and benchmarks,
and explore three central issues at the intersection of machine learning and
mathematical cognition: (i) the trade-offs between formal and informal
mathematics as training domains; (ii) the deeper reasons why proof generation
remains more brittle than code synthesis; (iii) and the question of whether
LLMs represent, or merely mimic, a notion of evolving logical state. Our goal
is not to draw hard boundaries, but to identify where the current limits lie,
and how they might be extended.

*Haoyu Wang,Chris M. Poskitt,Jun Sun,Jiali Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pro2Guard是一种基于概率可达性分析的主动运行时安全框架，用于预测和防止LLM代理的不安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的安全系统（如AgentSpec）缺乏预见性，难以应对长期依赖和分布变化，因此需要一种更主动的安全框架。

Method: Pro2Guard将代理行为抽象为符号状态，并从执行轨迹中学习离散时间马尔可夫链（DTMC），通过估计到达不安全状态的概率来预测风险。

Result: 在家庭代理和自动驾驶场景中，Pro2Guard分别实现了93.6%和100%的安全违规预测，并能提前干预。

Conclusion: Pro2Guard通过主动预测风险，显著提升了LLM代理的安全性，同时保持了任务完成率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities
across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation.
However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are
difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as
AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond
only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems
lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution
shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime
enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.
Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it
anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe
states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted
risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity
checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability
while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard
extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and
autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early
on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes
(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to
80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100%
prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to
38.66 seconds ahead.

TL;DR: MultiSHAP是一个模型无关的可解释性框架，用于量化多模态AI模型中视觉和文本元素的协同效应，适用于开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态AI模型的“黑盒”特性在高风险应用中限制了其部署，现有解释方法无法精确量化模态间的协同效应。

Method: 利用Shapley Interaction Index，MultiSHAP将多模态预测归因于视觉和文本元素的成对交互。

Result: 实验证明MultiSHAP能准确捕捉跨模态推理机制，并提供实例级和数据集级解释。

Conclusion: MultiSHAP为解释复杂多模态AI模型提供了一种通用解决方案，并可扩展到两种以上模态。

Abstract: Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that
require integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and
language. However, their "black-box" nature poses a major barrier to deployment
in high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are
essential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models
remains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as
attention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal
relationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between
modalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal
weights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability
framework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal
predictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual
elements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to
both open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level
explanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for
individual samples - "why the model makes a specific prediction on this input",
and (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction
patterns across samples - "how the model integrates information across
modalities". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP
faithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case
studies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond
two modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal
AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预咨询是医疗保健的重要组成部分，但直接从复杂电子病历生成问卷存在挑战，现有LLM方法在信息完整性和逻辑性上表现不佳。

Method: 分三阶段：1) 提取原子断言；2) 构建个人因果网络并合成疾病知识；3) 生成个性化及标准化问卷。

Result: 在真实电子病历数据集上验证，方法在信息覆盖、诊断相关性、可理解性和生成时间上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式临床知识克服了直接方法的限制，具有提升患者信息收集的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-consultation is a critical component of effective healthcare delivery.
However, generating comprehensive pre-consultation questionnaires from complex,
voluminous Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is a challenging task. Direct
Large Language Model (LLM) approaches face difficulties in this task,
particularly regarding information completeness, logical order, and
disease-level synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage
LLM-driven framework: Stage 1 extracts atomic assertions (key facts with
timing) from EMRs; Stage 2 constructs personal causal networks and synthesizes
disease knowledge by clustering representative networks from an EMR corpus;
Stage 3 generates tailored personal and standardized disease-specific
questionnaires based on these structured representations. This framework
overcomes limitations of direct methods by building explicit clinical
knowledge. Evaluated on a real-world EMR dataset and validated by clinical
experts, our method demonstrates superior performance in information coverage,
diagnostic relevance, understandability, and generation time, highlighting its
practical potential to enhance patient information collection.

Motivation: 现有可变滞后格兰杰因果性（VLGC）方法未能考虑因果交互在不同频带中的变化，例如脑信号中不同频带的延迟差异。

Method: 提出了MB-VLGC框架，明确建模频率依赖性因果延迟，并提供了理论证明和高效推理流程。

Result: 实验表明，MB-VLGC在合成和真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MB-VLGC框架具有广泛适用性，适用于任何类型的时间序列数据。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many
domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger
causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time
series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag
assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex
systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses
this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time
lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal
interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.
For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region
with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we
formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a
novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling
frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,
demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference
pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our
framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time
series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping
education through data-driven adaptation of learning experiences. Yet many of
these systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions
are made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but
neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework
that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user
personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to
user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process
tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design,
key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy,
fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that
enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

Motivation: 当前社交媒体AI推荐缺乏针对用户需求的解释性，导致用户不理解推荐原因，降低了推荐的价值。

Method: 提出了一种视觉解释系统，根据用户需求和上下文提供不同形式的解释（如技术详细版和简化版），并首次在一个流程中联合调整解释风格和粒度。

Result: 通过30名X用户的公开试点验证系统对决策和信任的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为社交媒体AI推荐提供了一种更透明、用户友好的解释方法，有望提升用户体验和信任。

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI
recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not
understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in
social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this
vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer
by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The
proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing
explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed
version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the
first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity
(expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will
validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

Result: 在音频和图像检测中性能超越或匹配基线方法，计算高效且适用于少样本场景。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态模型的特征可用于构建高效、通用的生成内容检测器。

Abstract: Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains,
including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious
users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating
deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is
pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the
majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and
fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family
of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative
classes and data domains. Towards a universal classifier, we propose the use of
large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content.
Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures
information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we
demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve
state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining
computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot
settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images,
achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline
methods.

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving
the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental
principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered
on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language
reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in
solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a
plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the
performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions
in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a
comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are
significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems
that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new
evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small
VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks
and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and
educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上是否真正接近人类写作。

Method: 比较四种ChatGPT模型与240名L1和L2英语参与者的文本，测量六个词汇多样性维度。

Result: LLM文本与人类文本在词汇多样性上差异显著，新模型差异更大。

Conclusion: LLM在词汇多样性上未达到人类水平，新模型反而更不接近人类，对语言教学有启示。

Abstract: The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains
unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has
received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of
lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical
diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,
and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n
= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were
measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,
disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and
Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed
significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini
and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated
higher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human
writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,
language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce
human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce
less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these
results for language pedagogy and related applications.

Conclusion: 建议研究者关注符号复杂性，避免翻译错误，提升建模的解释透明度和内部一致性。

Abstract: Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for
epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the
field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation
work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical
domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of
their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --
to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation
errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this
paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of
theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling
practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic
complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across
interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --
especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating
semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems
epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out
several recommendations for researchers to better account for these
epistemological issues in their own work.

Abstract: Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate
accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often
lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this
limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.
Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY
includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and
unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models
using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a
challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of
SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our
analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing
its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed
facts.

Motivation: 研究神经语义解析器是否能处理强上下文敏感的语言现象，特别是动词短语省略。

Method: 构建了包含120个省略案例及其完整语义表示的语料库，用于测试多种神经语义解析器。

Abstract: Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of
linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But
how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where
large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful
semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a
construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary
verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with
ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with
their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set
for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers
performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with
ellipsis. Data augmentation

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing
contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges
like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel
in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation.
Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address
these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and
fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the
optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware
requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM
selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific
models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware
requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously
updated.

Result: 指出了当前研究中的三个关键问题：检索任务主导、处理复杂表格的挑战以及模型泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以解决表格理解任务中的挑战，特别是在复杂表格处理和模型泛化方面。

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

Motivation: 传统GNN的固定聚合机制无法处理节点信息不平衡和全局语义关系，限制了模型性能。

Method: ReaGAN通过节点代理自主决策和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，实现自适应消息传递和全局关系构建。

Result: ReaGAN在少样本情境下表现优异，无需微调即可利用冻结的LLM骨干网络。

Conclusion: ReaGAN展示了代理规划和局部-全局检索在图学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of
agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Motivation: 小波变换在信号和图像处理中已广泛应用，但其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。本文旨在验证DWT在分析、压缩嵌入表示中的能力。

Method: 利用DWT对词和句子嵌入进行多分辨率分析，评估其在语义相似性任务中的表现，并测试不同嵌入模型的效果。

Result: DWT能将嵌入维度减少50-93%，且语义相似性任务性能几乎不变，下游任务准确率多数提升。

Conclusion: DWT为改进NLP应用提供了新途径，尤其在嵌入压缩和语义信息保留方面表现突出。

Abstract: Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in
different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate
patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from
data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms
can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic
properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase
the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different
levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall
quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity
tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information
in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using
different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream
tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by
50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks,
while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave
the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）是否对人类语言系统本身产生更广泛的影响。

Method: 构建一个包含2210万单词的非脚本口语数据集，分析ChatGPT发布前后与LLM相关词汇的使用趋势。

Result: 2022年后，与LLM相关的词汇使用显著增加，而基线同义词未显示显著变化。

Conclusion: 这可能标志着语言使用的显著变化，但变化是自然语言演变还是AI驱动的尚不明确，同时引发伦理担忧。

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has
undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed
to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target
audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are
often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to
generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a
dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from
conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends
before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated
words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of
these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and
LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no
significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of
words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language
use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by
AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem
from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training
misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These
findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

Abstract: Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities
in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic
reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to
enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We
propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured
clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct
Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines
for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute
pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head
Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's
etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we
introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds
etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected
Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided
Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework
improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning
Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant
Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that
our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex
scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach
to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model
attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising
paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in
complex clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其资源需求和有限上下文窗口问题尚未在长上下文场景中充分研究。

Method: 论文首先分析两种支持长上下文的LLM架构的优化方法，随后系统评估这些技术的组合效果，并研究其在70B参数模型上的扩展性。

Result: 研究发现，简单组合优化算法可能因累积近似误差对大型模型产生负面影响，且仅依赖F1分数会掩盖问答任务中的精度-召回权衡。

Conclusion: 通过系统级分析与任务特定洞察的结合，研究为LLM实践者和研究者提供了效率、准确性和扩展性的平衡指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing
tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although
techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these
issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains
underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations,
characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these
methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual
optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then
systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the
scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70
billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination
inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to
compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts.
Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding
precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating
system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM
practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

Motivation: 多模态句子嵌入模型常因图像-标题对中的噪声（冗余或无关信息）而受限。

Method: MCSEO利用分割和对象检测模型提取对象-短语对，优化对比学习目标。

Result: 在STS任务中，MCSEO在不同骨干模型上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 精确的对象-短语对齐对多模态表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs
in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain
noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or
caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances
multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase
alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO
utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate
object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning
objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models
demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting
the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal
representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ReAct）在复杂任务中表现有限，且依赖监督微调导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AdaPlan范式，结合全局规划与执行，并设计PilotRL框架进行渐进式强化学习训练。

Result: 实验显示PilotRL表现优异，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL超越GPT-4o 3.60%，且在小规模模型上提升55.78%。

Conclusion: AdaPlan和PilotRL有效解决了复杂任务中的规划与执行协调问题，显著提升了LLM代理的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling
agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges
when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent
paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate
action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring
long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner
and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in
agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion
trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted
with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an
adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize
high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon
decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward
PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by
progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to
follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.
Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of
generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning
and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve
state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing
closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78%
comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在知识密集型任务中因容量限制表现不佳的问题，探索动态推理机制提升性能。

Method: 提出动态任务向量机器范式，将模型内部推理（<think>和</think>标签内内容）视为动态任务向量，并通过RLVR优化。

Result: Lucy（1.7B参数）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，表现与更大模型相当。

Conclusion: 小型模型通过结构化、自构建的任务推理机制，可以媲美大型模型。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive
tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a
path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or
heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's
internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task
vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere
trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism
through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on
the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine
through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present
Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with
MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing
on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that
small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured,
self-constructed task reasoning.

Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在边缘设备上部署时因自注意力复杂度高和KV缓存需求大导致的性能问题。

Method: 采用Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT)策略和细粒度后训练量化（PTQ），优化计算图和缓存大小。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试和实际移动任务中表现优异，同时保持边缘NPU设备的效率。

Conclusion: EdgeInfinite-Instruct有效平衡了性能和效率，适用于边缘设备的长序列任务。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging
due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value
(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory
efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining
efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

Motivation: 现有研究假设ICL中的演示总是有效，但实际并非如此。本文旨在探究演示无效的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过梯度流和线性自注意力模型分析演示无效的原因，并提出基于梯度流大小的演示选择方法GradS。

Result: 实验表明，演示有效性差异随模型层数增加而放大，GradS在多个数据集上平均提升6.8%。

Conclusion: GradS通过考虑模型已学习信息，显著提升了演示选择的有效性，为ICL方法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context
learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,
existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations
provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations
are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration
ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear
self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a
demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by
the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is
amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective
ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus
on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the
model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which
leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of
the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as
the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We
validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream
datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness
among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating
our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on
average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SA-GCS显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable
agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex
environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in
intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for
this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising
post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL
methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence,
and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training
samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling
(SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum
Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator
(SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian
Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution,
enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design
significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and
enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav
benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines
across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and
generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness
and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

Abstract: Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields.
Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest
that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we
leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and
sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how
wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word
vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a
sentence with a dense amount of information in a fixed size vector based on
locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on
downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some
tasks) results to original embeddings.

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)
remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the
``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator
to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various
biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation
results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as
judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although
effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead
during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue
evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by
aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach
preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically
reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality
assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise
comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its
efficiency and robustness.

*Yixuan Tang,Jincheng Wang,Anthony K. H. Tung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了半真检测任务和PolitiFact-Hidden基准，并开发了TRACER框架，用于识别基于遗漏的误导信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统无法处理半真（事实正确但误导）的情况，因为它们未考虑遗漏的上下文。

Method: 提出TRACER框架，通过证据对齐、意图推断和隐藏内容因果影响评估来检测遗漏误导。

Result: TRACER显著提升了半真分类性能（F1提高16分），并适用于现有事实核查流程。

Conclusion: 建模遗漏对可信事实核查至关重要，TRACER为半真检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by
retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is
stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet
misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle
with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.
We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a
new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence
alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present
TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based
misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating
the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing
fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple
strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16
points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LoRA的表达能力与泛化能力之间的关系，并填补现有方法在平坦最小值与泛化能力关联上的研究空白。

Method: 提出Flat-LoRA和EFlat-LoRA，通过理论证明全参数空间的扰动可转移到低秩子空间，避免多矩阵干扰。

Result: EFlat-LoRA在GLUE和视觉语言模型任务中表现优于LoRA和全微调，验证了泛化与尖锐度的关联。

Conclusion: EFlat-LoRA在保持高效的同时提升了性能，证实了平坦最小值对LoRA泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and
generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat
minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not
been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically
seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose
Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for
LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full
parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach
eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across
multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large
language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves
optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining
comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with
RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and
0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat
shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,
respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of
LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本交流中，表情符号作为视觉替代品传递情感和语用信息，研究旨在探索表情符号与语音韵律的直接联系。

Method: 通过结构化的开放式生产和感知任务收集人类语音数据，分析表情符号对韵律的影响及听者的理解。

Result: 说话者会根据表情符号调整韵律，听者能通过韵律变化识别表情符号，且表情符号语义差异越大，韵律差异越明显。

Conclusion: 表情符号能有效传递韵律意图，揭示了其在数字媒介中的交际功能。

Abstract: Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken
communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In
text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual
surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how
emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret
prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link
prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through
structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides
empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.
Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners
can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and
greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic
divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers
of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally
mediated contexts.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型训练耗时耗力，即使是小型模型也需要多GPU和数天时间，亟需高效训练方法。

Method: 采用并行路径的PaPaformer架构，分路径训练后组合成完整模型，减少参数和训练时间。

Result: 实现了在数小时内完成训练，同时性能有所提升。

Conclusion: PaPaformer为高效训练语言模型提供了新思路，并支持任务定制化路径。

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount
of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language
models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often
requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate
decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks.
We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture
variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model.
The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually
with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.
This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and
the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel
path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to
accommodate specific task requirements.

Conclusion: NusaAksara填补了印尼原始脚本NLP研究的空白，揭示了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Indonesia is rich in languages and scripts. However, most NLP progress has
been made using romanized text. In this paper, we present NusaAksara, a novel
public benchmark for Indonesian languages that includes their original scripts.
Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse

rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including
low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although
unsupported by Unicode, the Lampung script is included in this dataset. We
benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o,
Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and
show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia's local scripts, with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续思维链（CCoT）方法存在间接微调、对齐不足或目标不一致的问题，影响了推理效率。

Method: SynAdapt生成合成CCoT作为精确对齐目标，并引入难度分类器识别难题，自适应提示LLM重新思考难题。

Result: 实验结果表明，SynAdapt在多种难度基准测试中实现了最佳的准确性与效率平衡。

Conclusion: SynAdapt通过合成CCoT和难度分类器，显著提升了LLM的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs
significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT).
Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT
methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or
inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically,
\textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and
effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the
LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying
solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this,
\textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both
question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help
identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt
the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive
experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels
strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best
accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM置信度估计方法忽略了响应与上下文的相关性，而CRUX旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CRUX通过上下文熵减少和统一一致性检查两个新指标，结合上下文信息评估置信度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CRUX的AUROC表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CRUX通过上下文感知的置信度估计，提升了LLM系统的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language
models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust
outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between
responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality
evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided.
To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and
Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context
faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics.
First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the
information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second,
unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through
the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context.
Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two
domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness,
achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图卷积网络（GCN）的混合主题模型GHTM，用于解决孟加拉语主题建模的挑战，并在实验中优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语因其形态复杂性和资源匮乏，主题建模研究较少，需要新方法提升效果。

Method: 使用GCN生成文档的语义嵌入，再通过NMF分解得到主题表示，并在三个孟加拉语数据集上对比传统和现代方法。

Result: GHTM在主题一致性和多样性上优于LDA、LSA、NMF、BERTopic和Top2Vec。

Conclusion: GHTM为孟加拉语主题建模提供了有效解决方案，并引入了新的数据集NCTBText以丰富语料库。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used
to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping
similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely
researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to
its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In
this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called
GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input
vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce
semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of
the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed
model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from
traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such
as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other
models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel
Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to
enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.

Result: 威胁或奖励对整体性能无显著影响，但提示变化可能显著影响单个问题的表现。

Conclusion: 简单提示策略对困难问题的效果有限，但个别问题的表现可能因提示变化而显著不同。

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held
prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI
model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and
threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025,
8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a
claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on
GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on
benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question
level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting
approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be
as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However,
as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield
significantly different results for individual questions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有AIG文本检测器在内部测试中表现良好，但在实际应用中不够鲁棒，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入DACTYL数据集，包含单样本/少样本生成的文本和领域特定CPT模型生成的文本，并比较了BCE和DXO两种优化方法。

Result: DXO分类器在分布外文本上表现优于BCE分类器，泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AIG文本检测器的改进空间，DXO优化方法在泛化性上具有优势。

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings
despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust
enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these
detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on
zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot
generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we
introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models
(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on
one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific
continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all
parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG
text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential
vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our
own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)
optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While
BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL
test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock
deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay
dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by
50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our
results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to
the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG
text detectors.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了LLMs在非西方语言和文化评估中的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily
lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has
become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM
performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources
for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data
rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with
non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on
the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation
datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law,
Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these
datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing
cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.

<details>

Motivation: 风格变化检测是计算作者分析中的重要且具有挑战性的问题，尤其是在句子级别检测风格变化。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（PLM）生成句子表示，通过双向LSTM（BiLSTM）对句子进行上下文建模，最后用多层感知机预测相邻句子的风格变化。

Result: 模型在PAN-2025测试数据集上取得了0.923（EASY）、0.828（MEDIUM）和0.724（HARD）的宏F1分数，优于随机基线和Claude-3.7-sonnet的零样本性能。

Conclusion: SSPC方法在风格变化检测任务中表现优异，尤其是在处理短句和风格浅显的句子时具有优势。

Abstract: Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing
style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in
computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges
participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:
individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with
controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to
address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that
is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair
Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model
(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed
into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.
The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed
to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work
of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is
relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in
leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most
challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of
"stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed
benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model
achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM,
and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random
baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot
performance.

Result: 在IL-PCR和COLIEE 2025数据集上验证，TraceRetriever能够有效应对文档增长挑战，并在部分案例信息下提供可靠检索。

Conclusion: TraceRetriever为法律先例检索提供了可靠且可扩展的基础，尤其适用于仅有部分案例信息的情况。

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed
by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial
decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents
challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world
legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only
rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our
pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining
initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.
Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier
trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,
TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with
practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent
retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is
available.

Motivation: 探索LLM在作者分析中最具挑战性的任务之一——句子级风格变化检测中的表现。

Method: 在PAN~2024和2025数据集上对四种LLM进行基准测试。

Result: LLM对写作风格变化敏感，其准确性优于PAN竞赛的基线，且对内容无关的风格信号更敏感。

Abstract: This article explores the zero-shot performance of state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) on one of the most challenging tasks in authorship
analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the
official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we
present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are
sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of
individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline
for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition.
Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present
evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to
content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在印度法律背景下常忽略法律条文和先例的重要性，NyayaRAG旨在填补这一空白，模拟真实法庭场景。

Method: 提出NyayaRAG框架，结合案件事实、法律条文和语义检索的先例，通过领域特定管道评估输入配置的效果。

Result: 结果显示，结合结构化法律知识显著提高了预测准确性和解释质量。

Conclusion: NyayaRAG为法律判决预测提供了一种更有效的方法，尤其适用于依赖条文和先例的普通法体系。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law,
aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in
legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on
internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook
a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions
and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic
courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,
relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG
evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court
decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline
tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input
configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as
LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual
inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive
accuracy and explanation quality.

Result: 在多个KGQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAMR通过自适应路径评估和动态训练机制，实现了高效且上下文感知的KGQA。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language
queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging
their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent
KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on
GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation
strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly
perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited
adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,
while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate
path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM
calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive
MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search
with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR
employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based
planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search
space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight
Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by
jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,
enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop
reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,
DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically
generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing
the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 设计实验，训练LLM学习虚构聊天机器人的名称和行为描述，但不包括对话示例，观察其是否能推断出聊天机器人的名称和行为特征。

Result: GPT 4o能够正确推断出聊天机器人的名称，并在后续训练中表现出更符合其描述的行为特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM具备一定的情境外推理能力，这对AI的情境意识和安全性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear
whether they can reason about the information present within their training
data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the
ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using
relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and
behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue
with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at
least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of
that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a
chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the
chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have
implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like
characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their
ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character
biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human
participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of
such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the
HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,
conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to
the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results
found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the
agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)
the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,
when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model
analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting
model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations
and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the
ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative
agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing
consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and
representation of human personality traits.

Motivation: 传统单步检索的RAG系统在复杂临床推理任务中表现有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用代理RAG框架，使LLM能自主分解问题、迭代检索临床证据并动态合成回答。评估了24种不同架构和规模的LLM。

Result: 代理检索显著提高了诊断准确性（73% vs. 64%），减少了幻觉（9.4%），并在46%的案例中检索到相关临床背景。

Conclusion: 代理框架能有效提升放射学QA的事实性和准确性，尤其对中等规模LLM效果显著，值得进一步临床验证。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,
traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question
answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability
to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG
framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,
iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and
dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning
diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms
(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104
expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and
ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic
accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional
online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized
models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models
(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B
parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,
agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically
relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even
clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,
MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of
retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic
frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,
particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their
clinical utility.

Conclusion: GLiDRE在文档级关系抽取任务中表现出色，尤其在少样本设置下。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to
the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences.
Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly
evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance
in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the
task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER
model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar
motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation
extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against
state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: MMBERT为中文仇恨言论检测提供了一种高效的多模态解决方案，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct
challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques
designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection
capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English
datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese
context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal
framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated
with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive
three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a
shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy
to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in
several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses
fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing
in-context learning approaches.

perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under
two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To
tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular
emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation.
Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing
state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via
optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs
exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation.
Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior
performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches.
Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this

Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLMs在敏感场景中公平性和包容性的问题，特别是代词使用的挑战。

Method: 方法是通过MISGENDERED+基准测试五种LLMs（GPT-4o、Claude 4、DeepSeek-V3、Qwen Turbo、Qwen2.5），评估其在零样本、少样本和性别身份推理任务中的表现。

Result: 结果显示在二元和性别中性代词上有所改进，但在新代词和反向推理任务上表现不一致。

Conclusion: 结论是尽管有进步，LLMs在身份敏感推理上仍有不足，未来研究需进一步改进包容性AI。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts
where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially
concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for
responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed
significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but
was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we
introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender
identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with
previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.
However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains
inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We
discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future
inclusive AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs因静态预定义生成长度的限制，导致性能与计算效率的权衡问题，阻碍了其实际应用。

Method: DAEDAL通过两阶段策略动态调整生成长度：1）初始长度扩展；2）去噪过程中动态干预。

Result: DAEDAL在性能上与固定长度基线相当甚至更优，同时提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: DAEDAL解决了DLLMs的静态长度约束，为其实际应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

Result: 在多样化视觉语言任务中，该方法优于现有持续学习方法，生成更符合指令的响应。

Conclusion: 新框架有效平衡了视觉和语言信息的处理，提升了模型在持续学习中的表现。

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在逼真头像通信中，利用面部运动模式作为行为生物特征进行身份验证的可行性，并提出了一种轻量级的时空图卷积网络架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着逼真头像在虚拟会议和社交平台中的普及，其带来的安全风险（如冒充）日益突出，需要研究可靠的身份验证方法。

Method: 使用GAGAvatar生成真实和冒充头像视频数据集，提出基于面部关键点的时空图卷积网络架构，结合时间注意力池化。

Result: 实验表明，面部运动特征可实现有效的身份验证，AUC值接近80%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在头像通信系统中开发更先进行为生物特征防御的紧迫性，并提供了公开的基准和系统。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Monado SLAM数据集，旨在解决头戴式传感器在复杂场景下的跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉惯性里程计（VIO）和SLAM系统在头戴式应用中难以应对高动态运动、遮挡等挑战性场景。

Method: 通过收集多款虚拟现实头显的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 数据集以CC BY 4.0许可发布，推动VIO/SLAM研究发展。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有数据集的不足，有助于解决实际应用中的关键问题。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上分别达到99%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素可能影响分类准确性。研究专注于眼周区域，以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用CNN模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像提取关键特征进行性别分类，并在两个数据集上验证性能。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%准确率，参数较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 模型表现优异，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一个新的视频生成模型评估指标，强调生成视频的内部世界一致性，通过四个可解释的子指标组合成一个统一分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，忽略了时间与物理一致性，WCS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS 整合了四个子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚），通过开源工具计算，并通过人类偏好数据训练权重。

Result: WCS 在多个基准测试中验证了与人类评价的相关性，并优于现有指标（如 FVD、CLIPScore 等）。

Conclusion: WCS 提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在时间与物理一致性方面的表现。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双代理的协作框架，用于多图像推理，通过语言提示和视觉推理模型实现自动化、模块化且无需训练的多任务泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨数据集和任务格式的多模态推理挑战。

Method: 采用双代理系统：语言提示工程师（PromptEngineer）生成任务特定提示，视觉推理模型（VisionReasoner）进行最终推理。

Result: 在18个多样化数据集上表现优异，Claude 3.7在TQA、DocVQA和MMCoQA任务中接近天花板性能。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型在信息提示引导下能有效进行多图像推理，模型选择和输入设计对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific
prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence
the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer提出了一种基于好奇心驱动探索的主动地理定位方法，通过内在奖励提升在未知目标和环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在距离估计困难或面对未知目标和环境时表现不佳，需要更可靠的探索策略。

Method: 提出GeoExplorer，利用好奇心驱动的内在奖励进行目标无关的探索，通过环境建模实现多样化和上下文相关的探索。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中验证了GeoExplorer的有效性和泛化能力，尤其在定位陌生目标和环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动的探索策略显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据的不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反射率物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC方法，为每个点添加概率属性以封装测量不确定性，并引入基于PPC的推理方法，可作为轻量级模块用于3D推理流程。

Result: 通过仿真和实际捕获数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远距离、低反射率物体及强环境光时表现更优。

Conclusion: PPC通过保留不确定性信息显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对不同模态的依赖程度，发现模型普遍偏向文本信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要综合医学图像和临床报告，但现有VLMs常偏向单一模态，忽略视觉线索。

Method: 通过交换样本的图像或文本来暴露模态偏差，评估六种开源VLMs在两种医学数据集上的表现。

Result: 模型在扰动和非扰动环境下均表现出对文本输入的强烈依赖，视觉信息常被忽略。

Conclusion: 设计多模态医学模型时需真正整合视觉和文本信息，而非依赖单一模态。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

Result: 提出的方法能够更准确地识别真实人格。

Conclusion: 通过模拟内部认知并结合2D-GNN，显著提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，语义提示显著优于纯空间提示基线。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成到SAM架构中，为高效适应提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as

research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在长距离依赖和全局上下文建模方面存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗过高，限制了高分辨率深度图处理能力。

Method: 设计了一种结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，显著减少参数的同时实现了更好的重建精度，尤其在大规模深度图超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型通过高效的状态空间建模和多尺度融合策略，解决了传统方法的局限性，为深度图超分辨率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal

and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of

### [90] [Towards Robust Semantic Correspondence: A Benchmark and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00272)
*Wenyue Chong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估语义对应在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的新基准，发现现有方法在挑战性场景中表现下降，并提出了一些关键见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究较少。

Method: 建立了一个包含14种挑战性场景的基准数据集，并评估了现有方法和增强策略。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下表现下降，大规模视觉模型能提高鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性。DINO模型优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者效果更好。

Conclusion: 通用数据增强无效，需任务特定设计，结果在数据集和现实基准中一致。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间自注意力机制和LSTM的新框架，用于在异构和分散数据中检测驾驶员疲劳，结合联邦学习和梯度相似性比较，实现了89.9%的检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因之一，但在现实场景中，由于数据分散且多样，准确检测疲劳仍具挑战性。

Method: 开发了空间自注意力机制（SSA）与LSTM结合的新框架，采用梯度相似性比较（GSC）优化联邦学习模型聚合，并设计了自动化视频数据处理工具。

Result: 在联邦学习设置下，框架检测准确率达到89.9%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效处理了现实数据的多样性，有望应用于智能交通系统，提升道路安全。

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Motivation: 现有训练自由引导框架要么内存需求高，要么控制效果不佳，限制了其在计算密集型扩散模型中的应用。

Method: 开发了一种无需反向传播的扩散潜在优化方法，研究了前向梯度下降在引导扩散任务中的应用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在内存管理和潜在优化上表现优异，显著提升了T2V性能。

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散引导基准测试中提升了性能。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AniMer+扩展了AniMer框架，通过高容量、家族感知的ViT和MoE设计，统一重建哺乳动物和鸟类，并利用扩散生成合成数据集解决数据稀缺问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，统一理解动态对象的需求及生物研究中跨物种姿态和形状准确估计的重要性，但现有方法网络容量有限且多物种数据集稀缺。

Method: 提出AniMer+，采用家族感知ViT和MoE设计，分区网络层为物种特定和共享组件；生成合成数据集CtrlAni3D和CtrlAVES3D。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像上训练，性能优于现有方法，尤其在Animal Kingdom数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集有效提升了实际应用性能，填补了鸟类3D数据空白。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶数据增强和场景模拟提供了强大且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出AerialCSP，一个用于CSP工厂的合成数据集，以减少真实数据标注的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSP工厂的无人机图像具有独特挑战，现有模型难以泛化，数据标注成本高。

Method: 创建AerialCSP虚拟数据集，模拟真实CSP工厂图像，用于模型预训练。

Result: AerialCSP显著提升真实缺陷检测性能，减少标注需求。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP相关视觉任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件相机方法未充分利用模态优势，限制了性能提升。

Method: 将增强流程分为可见性恢复和结构细化两阶段：前者设计振幅-相位纠缠网络，后者提出动态对齐融合策略，并结合对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦增强流程和动态对齐策略，有效提升了低光图像增强性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for
the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific

diversity, complexity, and real-world variability inherent in mathematical
content. In this work, we present DocTron-Formula, a unified framework built
upon general vision-language models, thereby eliminating the need for
specialized architectures. Furthermore, we introduce CSFormula, a large-scale
and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex
layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses
specialized models in terms of accuracy and robustness, but also establishes a
new paradigm for the automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，该方法比现有最优模型准确率提升27.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效支持自动驾驶系统在多样化、以人为中心的场景中的评估。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架通过低成本合成数据增强，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种个性化引导方法，用于平衡文本到图像扩散模型的目标分布对齐与原始模型知识保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样引导方法（如CFG和AG）无法有效平衡目标分布对齐和文本编辑性，导致性能受限。

Method: 利用未学习的弱模型和空文本提示，动态控制未学习程度，通过权重插值实现平衡。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 个性化引导方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更好的平衡性能。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Motivation: 传统方法无法充分建模探索的3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，且计算效率低。

Method: 通过增量更新场景表示、粗定位目标（利用几何信息进行离散空间匹配）和精细目标姿态优化（通过可微分渲染）实现导航。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置下大幅优于现有方法，并能处理更具挑战性的自由视角图像目标设置。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav是一种高效、3D感知的图像目标导航解决方案，适用于现实世界机器人平台。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms
conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and

Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪方法依赖静态坐标变换，忽略了车辆速度对观测噪声和参考帧变化的影响，导致在高动态场景中跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出SG-LKF，结合MotionScaleNet（MSNet）动态预测关键参数，并引入自监督轨迹一致性损失以增强帧间关联和轨迹连续性。

Result: 在KITTI 2D MOT和3D MOT以及nuScenes 3D MOT上表现优异，HOTA和AMOTA指标显著提升。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

*Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi,Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的蜂蜜植物来源自动分类方法，通过数据集准备、特征提取和分类三个步骤实现，实验结果表明其分类准确率最高达95.13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决蜂蜜植物来源自动分类问题，提高分类准确率。

Method: 数据集准备阶段使用类转换方法增强类间可分性；特征提取阶段采用线性判别分析（LDA）；分类阶段使用支持向量机（SVM）和K近邻（KNN）模型。

Result: 在标准蜂蜜高光谱成像数据集上，分类准确率最高达95.13%（图像分类）和92.80%（实例分类）。

Conclusion: 该方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类上表现优异，达到了当前最佳水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

*Liang Han,Xu Zhang,Haichuan Song,Kanle Shi,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon是一种新的神经隐式重建方法，通过基于体积渲染的特征一致性和不确定性引导的深度约束，解决了稀疏视图重建中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时未见过的视图上泛化能力差，或受限于有限的几何线索，导致重建质量不足。

Method: 提出特征一致性损失和不确定性引导的深度约束，以增强神经隐式场的重建效果。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在小重叠视图场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过结合特征一致性和深度约束，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的质量。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于衡量每个token表示的变化程度，实现与FlashAttention兼容的token压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型的规模和token数量增长，导致自注意力的二次计算成本和GPU内存访问开销增加。现有token压缩方法依赖注意力图，与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，无需训练或注意力图，直接测量token表示的变化程度，实现与FlashAttention兼容的token压缩。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的速度提升。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，适用于多种模型，且与FlashAttention兼容。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制性能，难以捕捉场景中的语义子动作。

Method: BiAnt结合前向和后向预测，利用大语言模型。

Conclusion: BiAnt通过双向预测有效提升长期动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应框架Adapt-WeldNet和可解释性分析框架DDIA，用于优化焊接缺陷检测的性能和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无损检测方法难以检测细微或内部缺陷，现有神经网络方法缺乏可解释性，存在安全隐患。

Result: 提高了缺陷检测性能和系统透明度，增强了信任和安全性。

Conclusion: 该工作提升了焊接缺陷检测系统的可靠性和安全性，适用于海洋和离岸环境。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。从常规病理图像预测基因表达是一种实用替代方案，但现有ViT模型性能不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用负实特征值初始化SSMs以增强低频模式捕捉能力。

Result: 在LOSO评估中，$MV_{Hybrid}$比最佳ViT模型相关性提高57%，性能下降减少43%，下游任务表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$展示了作为下一代病理视觉基础模型骨干的潜力，性能更优且鲁棒性更强。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因手部和唇部动作的异步性需要复杂模块，且数据有限导致融合机制训练不足，性能不佳。多智能体系统在有限数据下处理复杂任务的能力为此提供了新思路。

Method: Cued-Agent包含四个子智能体：基于多模态大语言模型的手部识别、基于Transformer的唇部识别、动态整合手部提示的代理，以及首次实现从音素到自然语言转换的自校正代理。

Result: 实验表明，Cued-Agent在正常和听力受损场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作有效解决了ACSR中的异步和数据限制问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

Result: 在少样本学习、基础到新类泛化和数据高效学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦与对齐策略有效解决了模态信息不对称问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成的视频越来越逼真，现有方法难以捕捉细微的时间不一致性，尤其是在视觉保真度高且运动连贯的AI生成视频中。

Method: 采用双分支架构，一支分析RGB帧以检测外观级伪影，另一支处理光流残差以揭示由不完美时间合成导致的细微运动异常。

Result: 在十种不同生成模型的文本到视频和图像到视频任务上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过整合互补特征，该方法能有效检测多种伪造视频。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在高风险工业领域中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建iSafetyBench数据集，包含1,100个工业场景视频片段，标注了98种常规和67种危险动作类别，并进行多标签评估。

Result: 现有模型在iSafetyBench上表现不佳，尤其是在识别危险活动和多标签场景中。

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒、安全感知的多模态模型，iSafetyBench为此提供了测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

Conclusion: 提出的方法在视频恢复质量和效率上表现优异，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

TL;DR: Sortblock是一种无需训练的推理加速框架，通过动态缓存块级特征并跳过冗余计算，显著提升DiTs的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs的序列去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了实时应用。现有加速方法未能充分利用去噪阶段和Transformer块的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock，动态缓存特征并根据残差变化排名自适应跳过冗余计算，加入轻量级线性预测减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构上实现2倍以上的推理加速，且输出质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率扩散模型中潜在通道增加导致的收敛慢和生成质量下降的问题，突破潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练策略，前者通过训练在潜在空间中引入通道结构，后者通过额外的扩散训练目标加速收敛。

Result: DC-AE 1.5在ImageNet 512x512上比DC-AE生成质量更高且快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过创新方法显著提升了扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Conclusion: 通过改进判别器设计和损失函数，论文方法显著提升了视频外绘的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战，实现了高性能和低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务因水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和模糊边界）面临挑战，现有方法难以保持实例连续性并抑制背景干扰。

Method: 设计了DTS模块（动态调整补丁偏移和缩放以保持实例连续性）和HSW模块（基于Ncut弱化背景干扰），将Mamba迁移至水下任务。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上达到最优性能，同时保持低参数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba通过创新模块成功解决了水下实例分割的挑战，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理先验知识和多区域修复技术的新方法，用于动态场景中的遮挡物体补全，显著提升了生成结果的准确性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景中因对人类-物体交互（HOI）理解有限，难以生成合理的补全结果。

Method: 利用人类拓扑和接触信息的物理约束，定义主次区域，并在扩散模型中采用定制化的去噪策略进行多区域修复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注即可保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了机器对动态环境的感知能力，适用于3D重建和新视角/姿态合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoTTA是一个针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时自适应框架，通过两阶段方法解决域偏移问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构分割对域偏移更敏感，传统方法难以应对拓扑结构变化和局部特征差异，导致性能下降。

Method: TopoTTA分为两阶段：第一阶段使用TopoMDC增强拓扑表示；第二阶段通过TopoHG生成伪标签并优化预测。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上，TopoTTA平均提升31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是一个有效的即插即用解决方案，适用于基于CNN的TSS模型。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

TL;DR: SDMatte利用扩散模型的强大先验和视觉提示驱动能力，提出了一种新的交互式抠图方法，显著提升了边缘细节的提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在提取边缘细节方面表现不足，而扩散模型因其复杂数据分布建模和纹理细节合成能力，成为潜在解决方案。

Method: SDMatte通过视觉提示驱动交互、坐标和透明度嵌入增强U-Net，以及掩码自注意力机制，优化了交互式抠图性能。

Result: 在多数据集上的实验表明，SDMatte在交互式抠图中表现优异，尤其在边缘细节提取方面。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动，显著提升了交互式抠图的精度和细节处理能力。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别和减轻文本到图像（T2I）模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先知道具体偏见类型，通过生成包容性提示和CLIP引导训练，显著减少偏见输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型常表现出未提及的社会偏见（如性别或种族刻板印象），现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性提示作为公平指南，并通过CLIP引导训练优化模型。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias检测准确率达91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，显著减少偏见输出，且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解生物生长的时序动态在多个领域至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时序进展方面表现有限。

Method: 提出CLIPTime框架，结合视觉和文本输入，学习联合嵌入并进行时间感知推理。使用合成真菌生长数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明CLIPTime能有效建模生物进展，并生成可解释的时间相关输出。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合（MHIF）任务因光谱与空间信息的固有权衡及观测数据有限而具有不适定性，现有方法未能有效解决数据不对齐问题。

Method: 提出 PIF-Net 框架，结合不适定先验和可逆 Mamba 架构，设计 Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation 模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net 的图像恢复性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效。

Conclusion: PIF-Net 通过创新架构和模块设计，有效解决了 MHIF 任务的不适定性，实现了高性能和高效率的融合。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Result: SeTe-VSR在细节恢复和感知质量上优于现有方法，同时保持高保真视觉效果。

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR为复杂视频超分辨率任务提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在RGB或深度域中使用欧几里得表示，难以捕捉事件的层次结构和时空连续性。

Method: 首先从点云序列中提取每帧空间特征，并将其嵌入到洛伦兹双曲空间中；引入双曲多头自注意力机制（HMHA）建模时间动态。

Result: 在TIMo和DAD数据集上分别实现了7%和5.6%的性能提升，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former通过直接在双曲空间中建模特征和异常评分，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考图像合成中保持空间布局一致性和连贯性的挑战。

Method: 基于MMDiT模型，引入Group Isolation Attention (GIA)和Region-Modulated Attention (RMA)两种注意力机制。

Result: 在ID-S、BG-S、IN-R和AVG等指标上优于现有方法，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了无需训练的新范式，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床信息对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

Conclusion: 该方法克服了现有方法的限制，提供了一种更高效、准确的遥感图像标注工具。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Result: 实验显示现有模型在EgoMask上表现差，但微调后性能显著提升，且不影响第三人称数据集的表现。

Conclusion: EgoMask为第一人称视频理解提供了重要资源和见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

### [135] [Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00548)
*Seunghyun Shin,Dongmin Shin,Jisu Shin,Hae-Gon Jeon,Joon-Young Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参考的视频色彩分级框架，通过扩散模型生成查找表（LUT）实现色彩属性对齐，并结合用户偏好文本提示进行低级特征增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易于非专业人士使用。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并通过文本提示增强低级特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效实现视频色彩分级，且不损失结构细节。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在视频色彩分级中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像中定位解剖结构相对位置的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并提出视觉提示和基准数据集MIRP以促进研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖解剖结构的相对位置信息，但现有VLMs在此任务上表现不足，亟需改进。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等先进VLMs的表现，并测试了视觉提示（如标记）的效果，同时提出了MIRP基准数据集。

Result: 所有模型均表现不佳，视觉提示仅带来有限改进，且VLMs过度依赖先验知识而非图像内容。

Conclusion: 医学图像中VLMs的定位能力仍需提升，MIRP数据集为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DBLP的高效扩散对抗净化框架，通过噪声桥蒸馏和自适应语义增强实现快速且高质量的净化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗扰动的脆弱性限制了其实际应用，现有扩散净化方法效率低下。

Method: 采用噪声桥蒸馏目标，结合潜在一致性模型和自适应语义增强（多尺度金字塔边缘图）指导净化过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA鲁棒精度和图像质量，推理时间约0.2秒。

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌剪枝框架，利用视觉编码器的分层注意力结构，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中视觉令牌过长导致的计算开销大和推理效率低的问题。

Method: 基于分层注意力结构选择三种信息丰富的令牌：锚点令牌、缓冲令牌和注册令牌，无需重新训练。

Result: 在多个模型上实现最优剪枝性能，保留高达99.3%任务准确率，同时减少9倍计算开销。

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的视觉令牌剪枝方法，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在八个基准测试中验证了FreeCP的有效性，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: FreeCP作为一种即插即用模块，能显著提升其他开放词汇语义分割方法的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Motivation: 铰接物体是日常环境中重要的可交互对象，但现有方法在物理合理性和点云对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 使用带符号距离函数（SDFs）表示部件形状，通过点云对齐损失和非穿透性、移动性约束引导反向扩散过程。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上评估，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: PhysNAP能够生成物理合理的铰接物体，并在点云对齐方面优于无引导的扩散模型。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Result: 伪标签获取更简便，性能优于现有弱标注方法，甚至在标注时间有限时优于真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低标注成本，提高目标检测效率，适用于专业领域。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

Motivation: 动态物体违反静态场景假设，导致无监督视觉里程计方法在动态场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出CoProU-VO，结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，通过概率公式实现跨帧传播。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在高速公路场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播有效提升动态场景中的视觉里程计性能。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂场景中难以区分罕见类别与真正未知对象的问题。

Method: 采用证据分类器结合似然比检验，显式考虑不确定性，输出概率分布而非点估计。

Result: 在五个标准数据集上，平均误检率降至2.5%，平均精度达90.91%，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性，该方法有效提升了未知对象的检测性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的重建框架EVAL，用于扩展VIIRS夜间灯光数据的时间序列，解决了现有方法低估光强度和结构遗漏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIIRS夜间灯光数据始于2012年，限制了长期时间序列研究，且现有方法存在光强度低估和结构遗漏的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提升初始重建保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩膜增强细节。

Result: 开发的EVAL产品将数据记录扩展至1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，具有优异的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL为研究社区提供了可靠的长期分析资源，显著优于现有产品。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at

TL;DR: Wukong是一个基于Transformer的NSFW检测框架，利用扩散模型的早期去噪步骤和预训练参数，显著提升了检测效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部保护措施（文本过滤和图像过滤）存在效率低或易受攻击的问题，需要一种更高效且准确的NSFW内容检测方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和U-Net的预训练交叉注意力参数，提出Wukong框架进行早期检测。

Result: Wukong在效率和准确性上显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器相当，但更高效。

Conclusion: Wukong为T2I生成中的NSFW内容检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过分治和专家定制建模，有效解决了异质运动模式的挑战，为两视图几何提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The
source code and pre-trained models are available at

Conclusion: DPoser-X在鲁棒性和多功能性上表现出色，成为全身人体姿态先验建模的新标杆。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: 合成数据能有效克服数据稀缺问题，推动可解释模型在医学图像分析中的应用。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

### [150] [Revisiting Adversarial Patch Defenses on Object Detectors: Unified Evaluation, Large-Scale Dataset, and New Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00649)
*Junhao Zheng,Jiahao Sun,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Chen Ma,Chong Zhang,Cong Wang,Qian Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对目标检测器补丁攻击的防御评估基准，揭示了现有防御方法的不足，并提供了新的数据集和见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有补丁攻击防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致和不完整。

Method: 重新评估了11种代表性防御方法，构建了包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的基准，并创建了大规模对抗补丁数据集。

Result: 发现数据分布是防御自然补丁的关键，新数据集可提升现有防御性能15.09% AP@0.5；攻击目标的平均精度与防御性能高度一致；自适应攻击能绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个基准测试中有效且具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练的深度特征在去雾任务中表现出色，RGB-D融合模块提升了去雾效果和适应性。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Result: 在4个开源数据集上验证了D3的优越性，例如在Gen-Video上比之前最佳方法提升10.39% mAP。

Conclusion: D3在计算效率和鲁棒性方面表现优异，为合成视频检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Method: 提出MIHBench基准，包含三个核心任务；设计动态注意力平衡机制以调整图像间注意力分布。

Result: 实验表明，动态注意力平衡机制能有效减少幻觉现象，提升多图像场景下的语义整合和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多图像MLLMs中幻觉问题的研究空白，并提出了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Result: 在实验中表现出最先进的计数准确性，并为文本到图像系统提供有效的数量控制。

Conclusion: YOLO-Count在计数和生成控制方面均取得了显著成果。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

*Adwait Chandorkar,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级骨干网络Dense Backbone，用于3D目标检测，显著降低计算成本同时保持高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络，增加了模型复杂度，而轻量级设计在3D领域研究较少。

Method: 设计了一种基于密集层的轻量级骨干网络Dense Backbone，并适配了多种3D检测器（如PillarNet）。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上参数减少29%，延迟降低28%，检测精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone是一种高效、轻量的骨干网络，可直接集成到现有架构中，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

TL;DR: GECO提出了一种基于最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，显著提升了语义对应和几何感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督视觉基础模型缺乏对底层3D几何的感知，GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最优传输框架进行训练，支持超出关键点的监督，适用于遮挡和去遮挡场景。

Result: GECO在PFPascal、APK和CUB上达到SOTA性能，PCK提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%，运行速度达30 fps。

Conclusion: PCK不足以衡量几何质量，GECO提出了新指标和见解，推动几何感知特征学习的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SU-ESRGAN是一种针对卫星图像的SR框架，结合了ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，提供语义一致性和像素级不确定性，适用于无人机和卫星系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs在图像超分辨率中缺乏语义一致性和像素级置信度，限制了其在遥感关键应用中的可信度。

Method: SU-ESRGAN整合了ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，生成像素级不确定性地图。

Result: SU-ESRGAN在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上与基线ESRGAN相当，并在无人机数据集上表现出更强的适应性。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在卫星和无人机应用中具有潜力，强调了领域感知训练的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态测试时间适应（TTA）框架，用于医学图像转换任务，通过重建模块和动态适应块解决分布外样本的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像转换在处理分布外样本时性能下降，需要一种动态适应方法。

Method: 引入重建模块量化域偏移，动态适应块选择性修改预训练模型的内部特征。

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI转换任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态样本特定调整是提高模型在真实场景中鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

TL;DR: PILOT框架通过双分支提示学习和无标签测试时适应策略，提升了零样本异常检测在域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在域偏移下表现不佳，因其训练数据有限且难以泛化到新分布。

Method: 提出双分支提示学习机制和基于伪标签的无标签测试时适应策略。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中达到最先进的异常检测和定位性能。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态适应和测试时优化，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Motivation: 探讨如何统一不同标记的3D数据，以提升公共安全应用中点云语义分割的可靠性。

Method: 采用分级标注方案和KPConv架构，通过IoU指标评估安全相关特征的性能。

Result: 几何较大的对象（如楼梯、窗户）分割性能较高，而较小安全关键特征识别率较低，性能受类别不平衡和几何限制影响。

Conclusion: 公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需要标准化标注协议和改进的标记技术，以解决数据异构性和小目标检测问题。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

Conclusion: ScaleSTF为大规模城市网络动态预测提供了新视角，解决了现有模型的效率与效能问题。

Abstract: Networked urban systems facilitate the flow of people, resources, and
services, and are essential for economic and social interactions. These systems
often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by
sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering
contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal
dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have
shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to
computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still
require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by
drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that
align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By
understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled
interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures
whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed
scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is
validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and
smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability.
Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in
large-scale urban networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HRGC剖面测量方法成本高、耗时长且存在安全隐患，需开发更高效、低成本的技术。

Method: 利用配备IMU和GPS传感器的测试车辆收集数据，结合工业标准行走剖面仪获取地面真实数据，开发了三种混合深度学习模型进行比较。

Result: 模型2和3表现最佳，能生成2D/3D HRGC剖面，显著提升测量效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架为HRGC剖面测量提供了快速、准确的解决方案，有助于提升公路和铁路安全性。

Abstract: Hump crossings, or high-profile Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs), pose
safety risks to highway vehicles due to potential hang-ups. These crossings
typically result from post-construction railway track maintenance activities or
non-compliance with design guidelines for HRGC vertical alignments.
Conventional methods for measuring HRGC profiles are costly, time-consuming,
traffic-disruptive, and present safety challenges. To address these issues,
this research employed advanced, cost-effective techniques and innovative
modeling approaches for HRGC profile measurement. A novel hybrid deep learning
framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures
was developed by utilizing instrumentation and ground truth data.
Instrumentation data were gathered using a highway testing vehicle equipped
with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS)
sensors, while ground truth data were obtained via an industrial-standard
walking profiler. Field data was collected at the Red Rock Railroad Corridor in
Oklahoma. Three advanced deep learning models Transformer-LSTM sequential
(model 1), LSTM-Transformer sequential (model 2), and LSTM-Transformer parallel
(model 3) were evaluated to identify the most efficient architecture. Models 2
and 3 outperformed the others and were deployed to generate 2D/3D HRGC
profiles. The deep learning models demonstrated significant potential to
enhance highway and railroad safety by enabling rapid and accurate assessment
of HRGC hang-up susceptibility.

Result: R-NP在2021-2023年表现最均衡，优于DNN和LEAR模型。

Conclusion: R-NP模型在多标准评估中表现最优，适合长期应用。

Abstract: This work integrates Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural
processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in the German market. Our
methodology integrates regime detection using a disentangled sticky
hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (DS-HDP-HMM) applied to
daily electricity prices. Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an
independent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized
mappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with
final predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We
rigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated
auto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse
battery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk
management, grid services, and cost minimization. This operational utility
assessment revealed complex performance trade-offs: LEAR often yielded superior
absolute profits or lower costs, while DNN showed exceptional optimality in
specific cost-minimization contexts. Recognizing that raw prediction accuracy
doesn't always translate to optimal operational outcomes, we employed TOPSIS as
a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation layer. Our TOPSIS analysis identified
LEAR as the top-ranked model for 2021, but crucially, our proposed R-NP model
emerged as the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022 and 2023.

by cognitive development that progressively builds a powerful LLM from a
compact foundation. DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into developmental
stages, each optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge
from earlier stages transfers to subsequent submodels, providing optimized
initialization parameters that prevent convergence to local minima and
accelerate training. This paradigm mirrors human learning, gradually
constructing comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills.
To efficiently build stage-specific submodels, DevFT introduces
deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to
distill essential information and construct representative layers. Evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DevFT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.59$\times$ faster convergence,
10.67$\times$ reduction in communication overhead, and 9.07% average
performance improvement, while maintaining compatibility with existing
approaches.

### [165] [Improved Robustness and Functional Localization in Topographic CNNs Through Weight Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00043)
*Nhut Truong,Uri Hasson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较了两种空间约束（权重相似性和激活相似性）对地形卷积神经网络的影响，发现权重相似性在鲁棒性、输入敏感性和功能定位方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 权重相似性约束能产生更鲁棒的表示，并影响特征学习和功能组织，适用于生物物理启发模型。

Abstract: Topographic neural networks are computational models that can simulate the
spatial and functional organization of the brain. Topographic constraints in
neural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different
impacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such
different implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end,
here we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two
spatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to
develop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which
enforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on
classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input
degradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared
to both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved
robustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)
greater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)
stronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations
positioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in
orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,
indicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational
geometry of the network. Our findings suggest that during end-to-end training,
WS constraints produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic
CNNs. These findings also suggest that weight-based spatial constraints can
shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysical inspired
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅涵盖简单的部分可观测形式（如特征掩码和高斯噪声），无法反映真实场景（如视觉遮挡或未知对手意图），因此需要更全面的基准。

Method: 提出POBAX开源库，包含多种部分可观测环境（如定位与映射、视觉控制、游戏等），并提供推荐的超参数和算法实现。

Result: 所选环境均具有内存可改进性，需要难以学习的内存功能，为部分可观测研究提供了明确信号。

Conclusion: POBAX为部分可观测强化学习研究提供了标准化、可扩展的基准框架，支持快速评估和GPU加速实验。

Abstract: Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for
general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to
mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to
gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only
evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature
masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of
partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown
opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two
key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to
ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the
performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors
roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where
performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with
partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice
guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial
observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable
Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present
in various environments and select representative environments for our
benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,
games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory
improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete
signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended
hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box
evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for
GPU-scalable experimentation.

TL;DR: TriP-LLM是一种基于大语言模型的无监督时间序列异常检测框架，通过三分支设计整合局部和全局特征，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网和智能制造的普及，时间序列数据的规模和维度激增，传统统计方法难以应对其高异质性和复杂性。

Method: TriP-LLM通过Patching、Selection和Global三分支设计将时间序列编码为补丁令牌，利用预训练的大语言模型处理，并通过轻量级解码器重构输入以计算异常分数。

Result: 在多个公共基准数据集上，TriP-LLM表现优于现有方法，且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: TriP-LLM展示了LLM在时间序列异常检测中的重要作用，并提供了高效且内存友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of
application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of
Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically
increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the
limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high
heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of
large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision
domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A
Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly
Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features
through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input
time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,
pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from
which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public
benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation
metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to
ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating
strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,
we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.
Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch
processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it
more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model
checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合LightGBM回归模型和遗传算法优化的新方法，用于评估COVID-19相关指标对比特币回报预测的贡献。结果表明，疫情指标显著提升了预测准确性，尤其是疫苗接种数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨疫情相关健康数据是否能显著提升比特币回报预测的准确性，而非仅关注预测本身。

Method: 构建了包含比特币回报和COVID-19指标的全面数据集，使用遗传算法优化模型，并通过统计方法（如Mann-Whitney U检验）比较性能。

Result: COVID-19指标显著提升了模型性能（R2增加40%，RMSE降低2%），疫苗接种数据是主要预测因素。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了金融分析工具，为投资者和政策制定者在系统性危机中提供了更精确的市场不确定性指标。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM
regression model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to systematically
evaluate the contribution of COVID-19-related indicators to Bitcoin return
prediction. The primary objective was not merely to forecast Bitcoin returns
but rather to determine whether including pandemic-related health data
significantly enhances prediction accuracy. A comprehensive dataset comprising
daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates,
hospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models,
trained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31
independent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics
(R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and
Mann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified
individual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators
significantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme
market fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly
significant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics,
especially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as
dominant predictors. The proposed methodology extends existing financial
analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing investors and
policymakers with refined indicators to navigate market uncertainty during
systemic crises.

Motivation: 受材料科学中临时（弹性）和永久（塑性）变形概念的启发，旨在解决深度神经网络在训练过程中因优化困难而陷入尖锐极小值的问题。

Method: 提出了塑性变形优化器（Plastic Deformation Optimizer），通过内部应力信号检测训练停滞，并自适应地向模型参数注入噪声，帮助模型逃离尖锐极小值。

Result: 在六种架构、四种优化器和七个视觉基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态调整优化行为，为深度神经网络在复杂训练场景中提供了更强的适应性和泛化性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training
paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization
behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain
dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic)
Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To
instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a
stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters
whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and
accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model
to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions
of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers,
and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization
with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available
on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Abstract: Liver diseases are a serious health concern in the world, which requires
precise and timely diagnosis to enhance the survival chances of patients. The
current literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning
models to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high
misclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational
expense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these
drawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked
ensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses
advanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model
robustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal
with class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an
ensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose
complementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided
model demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%,
Cohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and
efficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice
(training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate
transparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high
concentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important
observations of liver disease. Also, SHAP was used to rank features by their
global contribution to predictions, while the Morris method confirmed the most
influential features through sensitivity analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代神经网络缺乏结构性保障，导致学习不稳定和可解释性差，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将层变换分解为结构化线性算子和残差校正组件，优化信号传播和训练动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法改善了梯度条件、降低了对扰动的敏感性，并增强了层间鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更稳定、透明的神经网络架构提供了新工具，同时保持了表达能力。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, contemporary neural networks often lack
structural safeguards that promote stable learning and interpretable behavior.
In this work, we introduce a reformulation of layer-level transformations that
departs from the standard unconstrained affine paradigm. Each transformation is
decomposed into a structured linear operator and a residual corrective
component, enabling more disciplined signal propagation and improved training
dynamics. Our formulation encourages internal consistency and supports stable
information flow across depth, while remaining fully compatible with standard
learning objectives and backpropagation. Through a series of synthetic and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that models constructed with these
structured transformations exhibit improved gradient conditioning, reduced
sensitivity to perturbations, and layer-wise robustness. We further show that
these benefits persist across architectural scales and training regimes. This
study serves as a foundation for a more principled class of neural
architectures that prioritize stability and transparency-offering new tools for
reasoning about learning behavior without sacrificing expressive power.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过PCA和变分自编码器（VAE）降低心电图（ECG）数据的复杂性，提出三种新型VAE变体，并在小规模数据集上验证其效果。其中A beta-VAE在信号重建上表现最佳，SAE编码结合传统特征提升了LVEF预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号复杂且个体差异大，传统深度学习方法在小数据集上效果不佳，因此需要简化数据并提升模型效率。

Method: 使用PCA和三种新型VAE（SAE、A beta-VAE、C beta-VAE）进行特征提取，结合LGBM分类器进行预测任务。

Result: A beta-VAE信号重建误差低至15.7+/-3.2 μV；SAE编码结合传统特征在LVEF预测中AUROC达0.901，接近CNN模型但计算资源更少。

Conclusion: VAE编码能有效简化ECG数据，为小规模数据集的深度学习应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for
cardiac assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the
high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a
60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep
learning models, especially when only small training datasets are available.
This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods
from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants-Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed
beta-VAE (A beta-VAE), and Cyclical beta VAE (C beta-VAE)-and compare their
effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream
prediction tasks using a Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM). The A beta-VAE
achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE)
to 15.7+/-3.2 muV, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE
encodings, when combined with traditional ECG summary features, improved the
prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an
holdout test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
of 0.901 with a LGBM classifier. This performance nearly matches the 0.909
AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN model but requires significantly less
computational resources. Further, the ECG feature extraction-LGBM pipeline
avoids overfitting and retains predictive performance when trained with less
data. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective
in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep
learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycling volume estimation is essential for sustainable
urban transportation planning. However, many cities face significant challenges
of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To
address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize
sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in
data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL
agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to
maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network,
comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments
(99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume
estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in
deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms
traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness
centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random
placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our
experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep
learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its
effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable
insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and
maximize volume estimation accuracy and reliability of bicycling data for
informed transportation planning decisions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于权重而非激活的新方法，用于理解和监控微调后的LLM，无需与训练数据分布相似的数据。该方法通过分析权重差异的奇异向量检测新行为，并在防御后门攻击和检测未学习信息方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活的解释方法需要与训练数据分布相似的数据，限制了其在检测新型威胁（如后门攻击）中的应用。

Method: 通过分析微调模型与基础模型权重差异的奇异向量，监控激活的余弦相似度，检测新行为。

Result: 成功防御100%的后门攻击（假阳性率低于1.2%），检测未学习信息的准确率达95.42%，并能恢复“未学习”信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在监控和审计微调LLM方面具有潜力，可应用于商业模型分析，揭示其微调重点。

Abstract: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often
not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing
interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often
require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant
limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like
backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and
controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,
thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the
unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the
weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to
newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations
along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during
fine-tuning with high precision.
  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger
is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate
below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on
erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to
recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows
potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial
instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover
model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney
prompt generation.

Result: RL框架成功解决了回归问题，并在目标定义和学习过程中表现出更高的灵活性。

Conclusion: 强化学习为回归问题提供了新的解决范式，具有更强的适应性和灵活性。

Abstract: Standard regression techniques, while powerful, are often constrained by
predefined, differentiable loss functions such as mean squared error. These
functions may not fully capture the desired behavior of a system, especially
when dealing with asymmetric costs or complex, non-differentiable objectives.
In this paper, we explore an alternative paradigm: framing regression as a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We demonstrate this by treating a model's
prediction as an action and defining a custom reward signal based on the
prediction error, and we can leverage powerful RL algorithms to perform
function approximation. Through a progressive case study of learning a noisy
sine wave, we illustrate the development of an Actor-Critic agent, iteratively
enhancing it with Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity,
and positional encoding to enable a capable RL agent for this regression task.
Our results show that the RL framework not only successfully solves the
regression problem but also offers enhanced flexibility in defining objectives
and guiding the learning process.

Result: 实验表明，BEMA在多种语言模型基准测试中比EMA和普通训练具有更快的收敛速度和更好的最终性能。

Conclusion: BEMA是一种实用且理论支持的方法，能显著提升语言模型微调的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning, often caused by the small batch
sizes typically used in this regime, can destabilize training by introducing
large oscillations in generation quality. A popular approach to mitigating this
instability is to take an Exponential moving average (EMA) of weights
throughout training. While EMA reduces stochasticity, thereby smoothing
training, the introduction of bias from old iterates often creates a lag in
optimization relative to vanilla training. In this work, we propose the
Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA), a simple and practical
augmentation of EMA that retains variance-reduction benefits while eliminating
bias. BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate
provable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training.
Through an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA
leads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over
both EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making
BEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and
efficient fine-tuning.

learning (RL) offers a solution to optimize longer-term goals, such as
in-session engagement, applying it at web scale is challenging due to the
extremely large action space and engineering complexity. In this paper, we
introduce RecoMind, a simulator-based RL framework designed for the effective
optimization of session-based goals at web-scale. RecoMind leverages existing
recommendation models to establish a simulation environment and to bootstrap
the RL policy to optimize immediate user interactions from the outset. This
method integrates well with existing industry pipelines, simplifying the
training and deployment of RL policies. Additionally, RecoMind introduces a
custom exploration strategy to efficiently explore web-scale action spaces with
hundreds of millions of items. We evaluated RecoMind through extensive offline
simulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform. Both methods
showed that the RL policy trained using RecoMind significantly outperforms
traditional supervised learning recommendation approaches in in-session user
satisfaction. In online A/B tests, the RL policy increased videos watched for
more than 10 seconds by 15.81\% and improved session depth by 4.71\% for
sessions with at least 10 interactions. As a result, RecoMind presents a
systematic and scalable approach for embedding RL into web-scale recommendation
systems, showing great promise for optimizing session-based user satisfaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段框架，利用几何信息改进预训练模型在噪声标签数据下的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在噪声标签数据下性能下降，现有kNN方法依赖局部几何信息但仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：可靠性估计和加权推理，引入非负核（NNK）邻域构建和几何信息。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和DermaMNIST上表现优于标准kNN和自适应邻域基线方法。

Conclusion: 几何信息能有效提升噪声标签数据下的鲁棒性，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental
for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where
obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we
assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage
framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise
without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor
(kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good
performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated
by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper,
following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by
reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be
achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our
proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using
the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several
methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local
neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and
DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise
conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent
adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Motivation: 研究LoRA在多模态和大语言模型中的局限性，并提出更高效的替代方法。

Method: 通过合成矩阵近似基准进行定量比较，并提出基于Khatri-Rao积的KRAdapter算法。

Result: KRAdapter在视觉语言模型和大语言模型上表现优于LoRA，尤其在未见常识推理任务中。

Conclusion: KRAdapter是一种高效且实用的PEFT方法，适用于十亿级参数模型的微调。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for
adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted
its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when
applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a
quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a
synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties.
Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively
flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks.
To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the
Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to
produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance
gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large
language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense
reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute
efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune
billion-scale parameter models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了指令调优对大型语言模型（LLM）置信度校准的影响，并提出标签平滑作为解决方案，同时解决了内存占用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优提升了LLM的交互能力，但其对置信度校准的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 分析了多种开源LLM，发现指令调优后校准退化，提出标签平滑作为解决方案，并设计定制内核以减少内存占用。

Result: 标签平滑能有效维持校准，但在大词汇量LLM中效果受限；理论及实验验证了过自信与模型规模的关系。

Conclusion: 标签平滑是解决校准问题的实用方法，定制内核优化了内存效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater
opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as
more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following
ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for
reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine
various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation
after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards
label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for
overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing
is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However,
settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in
particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to
stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship
with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and
experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory
footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss
setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory
consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing
solutions for non-smoothed losses.

Motivation: 通过分析大量学生数据，优化反馈策略以提高学生答题正确率和学习效果。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机（MAB）框架和离线策略评估，设计算法为每个问题选择最佳反馈策略，并探索上下文老虎机（CB）策略的个性化效果。

Result: 在166,000次练习会话中验证了MAB策略显著提升学生表现，但CB策略的个性化效果有限。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的反馈优化系统已大规模部署，未来可进一步探索个性化策略的潜力。

Abstract: We present an online tutoring system that learns to provide effective
feedback to students after they answer questions incorrectly. Using data from
one million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of
multiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning.
Employing the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation,
we assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance
policies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness,
session completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a
suitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second
attempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the
resulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant
improvements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the
overall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit
(CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on
individual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using
causal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across
students and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect
heterogeneity, outperform MAB policies. While our analysis reveals that some
actions for some questions exhibit effect heterogeneity, effect sizes may often
be too small for CB policies to provide significant improvements beyond what
well-optimized MAB policies that deliver the same action to all students
already achieve. We discuss insights gained from deploying data-driven systems
at scale and implications for future refinements. Today, the teaching policies
optimized by our system support thousands of students daily.

Abstract: This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design
as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived
to achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine
learning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and
performance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based
design. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation
function into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem.
The developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel
and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional
properties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in
terms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models
(e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic
design, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the
optimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables,
consistent with engineering principles.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various
graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing
graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under
distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable
graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially
a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and
structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles
remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph
Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn
generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between
predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three
modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant
subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while
preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving
subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently
capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during
training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph
node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph
representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical
justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under
distribution shifts.

Result: 在混沌测试中，PnP-DA在不同观测稀疏性和噪声水平下均显著降低预测误差，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PnP-DA通过放松统计假设和利用历史数据，提供了一种更有效的数据同化解决方案。

Abstract: Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally
efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary
simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system
suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate
these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model
forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error
statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic
dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates
(1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance
misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained
generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional
Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions
and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization
functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the
complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles.
Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy
consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities
and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

Abstract: Understanding how language models develop their internal computational

susceptibilities, drawn from statistical physics, offer a promising analytical
tool, their full potential for visualizing network organization remains
untapped. In this work, we introduce an embryological approach, applying UMAP
to the susceptibility matrix to visualize the model's structural development
over training. Our visualizations reveal the emergence of a clear ``body
plan,'' charting the formation of known features like the induction circuit and
discovering previously unknown structures, such as a ``spacing fin'' dedicated
to counting space tokens. This work demonstrates that susceptibility analysis
can move beyond validation to uncover novel mechanisms, providing a powerful,
holistic lens for studying the developmental principles of complex neural
networks.

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，BOOD显著优于现有方法，FPR95降低29.64%，AUROC提升7.27%。

Conclusion: BOOD提供了一种高效生成OOD特征的策略，显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training
data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective
features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains
challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between
classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based
Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD
features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models.
BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset,
selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to
cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features
are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to
previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for
synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions
between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks
demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly,
achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27%
improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

Conclusion: SGPC通过理论性能界限和端到端训练，显著提升了异质图上的节点分类性能，同时具备计算效率。

Abstract: Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct
node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often
have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this
problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf
structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based
models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet
fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a
novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified
architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several
mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced
diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised
node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and
demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via
end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine
homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms
state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified
confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

Abstract: Designing residential interiors strongly impacts occupant satisfaction but
remains challenging due to unstructured spatial layouts, high computational

expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a structured reward
function. OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and
flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental
dynamics under partial observability. Experiments conducted across diverse room
shapes and furniture configurations demonstrate that OID-PPO significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of layout quality and
computational efficiency. Ablation studies further demonstrate the impact of
structured guideline integration and reveal the distinct contributions of
individual design constraints.

Abstract: To deal with changing environments, a new performance measure -- adaptive
regret, defined as the maximum static regret over any interval, was proposed in
online learning. Under the setting of online convex optimization, several
algorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.
However, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only
handle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,
which hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,
which automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially
concave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary
or changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual
adaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and
aggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a
second-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further
incorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing
environments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies
(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to
achieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able
to minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions
simultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.
Moreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,
and develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of
composite functions.

Abstract: Nowadays machine learning (ML) practitioners have access to numerous ML
libraries available online. Such libraries can be used to create ML pipelines
that consist of a series of steps where each step may invoke up to several ML
libraries that are used for various data-driven analytical tasks. Development
of high-quality ML pipelines is non-trivial; it requires training, ML
expertise, and careful development of each step. At the same time, domain
experts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and
training while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper,
we present our ExeKGLib, a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface
layer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This
is achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple

Motivation: 尽管带有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）在提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力方面显示出潜力，但其依赖人工标注标签的问题在复杂任务中尤为突出。现有的自奖励方法虽然展现了潜力，但存在崩溃问题。

Method: 提出Co-Reward框架，通过构造语义相似的对比问题对，利用简单的投票机制生成代理标签，并通过交叉引用问题对的标签来强化推理一致性。

Conclusion: Co-Reward通过自监督的奖励机制有效避免了崩溃问题，提升了推理能力的稳定性和性能，为LLM的强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) shows promise
in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), the scaling
up dilemma remains due to the reliance on human annotated labels especially for
complex tasks. Recent alternatives that explore various self-reward signals
exhibit the eliciting potential of LLM reasoning, but suffer from the
non-negligible collapse issue. Inspired by the success of self-supervised
learning, we propose \textit{Co-Reward}, a novel RL framework that leverages
contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward
basis. Specifically, we construct a similar question for each training sample
(without labels) and synthesize their individual surrogate labels through a
simple rollout voting, and then the reward is constructed by cross-referring
the labels of each question pair to enforce the internal reasoning consistency
across analogical inputs. Intuitively, such a self-supervised reward-shaping
mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial
solution, and promotes stable reasoning elicitation and improvement through
expanding the input sample variants. Empirically, Co-Reward achieves superior
performance compared to other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning
benchmarks and LLM series, and reaches or even surpasses ground-truth (GT)
labeled reward, with improvements of up to $+6.8\%$ on MATH500 over GT reward
on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Prediction of post-loan default is an important task in credit risk
management, and can be addressed by detection of financial anomalies using
machine learning. This study introduces a ResE-BiLSTM model, using a sliding
window technique, and is evaluated on 44 independent cohorts from the extensive
Freddie Mac US mortgage dataset, to improve prediction performance. The
ResE-BiLSTM is compared with five baseline models: Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), BiLSTM, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), across multiple metrics, including
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC. An ablation study was conducted to
evaluate the contribution of individual components in the ResE-BiLSTM
architecture. Additionally, SHAP analysis was employed to interpret the
underlying features the model relied upon for its predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that ResE-BiLSTM achieves superior predictive performance
compared to baseline models, underscoring its practical value and applicability
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ctdGAN的条件生成对抗网络，用于解决表格数据中的类别不平衡问题，通过空间分区和新的损失函数生成高质量样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据中的类别不平衡问题严重影响机器学习性能，现有GAN方法未考虑输入样本的向量子空间，且类别标签处理方式不佳。

Method: ctdGAN通过空间分区为输入样本分配聚类标签，利用新的概率采样策略和损失函数生成样本，并引入聚类尺度技术。

Result: 在14个不平衡数据集上的实验表明，ctdGAN能生成高保真样本并显著提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: ctdGAN通过改进的生成策略和损失函数，有效解决了表格数据中的类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in
relational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms,
tabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious
performance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the
most effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the
under-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed
GAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the
real data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,
the class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical
variables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less
effective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a
conditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,
ctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input
samples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a
novel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes
both cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to
generate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data
distribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,
yet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature
modes without affecting data dimensionality. The exhaustive evaluation of
ctdGAN with 14 imbalanced datasets demonstrated its superiority in generating
high fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoLL框架，结合LLMs和GNNs，利用文本和图结构的互补优势，提升文本属性图的异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图异常检测方法忽视文本模态的互补价值，且文本特征编码浅层，可能遗漏异常相关语义。LLMs虽具潜力，但难以编码高阶图结构信息。

Method: CoLL框架通过多LLM协作生成证据增强的文本特征，结合带门控机制的GNN自适应融合文本与图结构信息。

Result: 实验显示CoLL平均AP提升13.37%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoLL为LLMs在图异常检测中的应用开辟了新途径，展示了文本与图结构融合的潜力。

Abstract: The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual
information in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for
graph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on
designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking
the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often
encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so
that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the
enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have
emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding
and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly
detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural
information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For
high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that
combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary
strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented
generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable
rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped
with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while
preserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37%
in AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.

Result: CMUCL显著提升了检测性能，平均准确率（AP）比次优方法提高了11.13%。

Conclusion: CMUCL为文本属性图异常检测提供了有效解决方案，并发布了8个数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: The widespread application of graph data in various high-risk scenarios has
increased attention to graph anomaly detection (GAD). Faced with real-world
graphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences,
termed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection
pipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual
information into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks
within the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding
process is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph
domain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus
on GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.
How to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast
potential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging
issue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed
graph anomaly detection, named CMUCL. We simultaneously model data from both
text and graph structures, and jointly train text and graph encoders by
leveraging cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency to uncover
potential anomaly-related information. Accordingly, we design an anomaly score
estimator based on inconsistency mining to derive node-specific anomaly scores.
Considering the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for anomaly detection on
TAGs, we release 8 datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive
evaluations show that CMUCL significantly advances in text-attributed graph
anomaly detection, delivering an 11.13% increase in average accuracy (AP) over
the suboptimal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在线非子模优化问题，提出了两种算法（DBGD-NF和其扩展版）以解决延迟反馈和带反馈的联合效应问题，取得了更好的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在带延迟反馈的在线非子模优化中，遗憾界依赖于最大延迟且对不规则延迟敏感，同时未能解耦延迟和带反馈的联合效应。

Method: 提出了DBGD-NF算法（使用单点梯度估计器）及其扩展版（采用块更新机制），分别优化了遗憾界。

Result: DBGD-NF的遗憾界为O(n¯d^{1/3}T^{2/3})，扩展版为O(n(T^{2/3} + √(dT)))，在特定条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新算法在理论和实验中均表现出优越性，尤其在延迟不规则时更具优势。

Abstract: We investigate the online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback in
the bandit setting, where the loss function is $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular
and $\beta$-weakly DR-supermodular. Previous work has established an
$(\alpha,\beta)$-regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(nd^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $n$ is
the dimensionality and $d$ is the maximum delay. However, its regret bound
relies on the maximum delay and is thus sensitive to irregular delays.
Additionally, it couples the effects of delays and bandit feedback as its bound
is the product of the delay term and the $\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ regret bound
in the bandit setting without delayed feedback. In this paper, we develop two
algorithms to address these limitations, respectively. Firstly, we propose a
novel method, namely DBGD-NF, which employs the one-point gradient estimator
and utilizes all the available estimated gradients in each round to update the
decision. It achieves a better $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret
bound, which is relevant to the average delay $\bar{d} =
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T d_t\leq d$. Secondly, we extend DBGD-NF by employing a
blocking update mechanism to decouple the joint effect of the delays and bandit
feedback, which enjoys an $\mathcal{O}(n(T^{2/3} + \sqrt{dT}))$ regret bound.
When $d = \mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$, our regret bound matches the
$\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ bound in the bandit setting without delayed feedback.
Compared to our first $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ bound, it is more
advantageous when the maximum delay $d = o(\bar{d}^{2/3}T^{1/3})$. Finally, we
conduct experiments on structured sparse learning to demonstrate the
superiority of our methods.

Motivation: 解决高光谱成像中弱矿物信号被噪声和冗余波段掩盖的问题。

Method: 第一阶段：信噪比筛选和Savitzky-Golay平滑；第二阶段：KMeans聚类提取端元，NNLS解混。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了解混精度和弱矿物区域的检测能力。

Conclusion: 两阶段策略为地质高光谱应用提供了实用且可重复的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging offers detailed spectral information for mineral
mapping; however, weak mineral signatures are often masked by noisy and
redundant bands, limiting detection performance. To address this, we propose a
two-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite
mining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
for each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to
discard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing
background noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral
smoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection,
and second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In
the second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where
KMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed
by non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. The resulting
endmembers are quantitatively compared with laboratory spectra (W1 raw) using
cosine similarity and RMSE metrics. Experimental results confirm that our
proposed pipeline improves unmixing accuracy and enhances the detection of weak
mineral zones. This two-pass strategy demonstrates a practical and reproducible
solution for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological HSI
applications.

Abstract: We argue that existing definitions of interpretability are not actionable in
that they fail to inform users about general, sound, and robust interpretable
model design. This makes current interpretability research fundamentally
ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose a definition of interpretability
that is general, simple, and subsumes existing informal notions within the
interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it
directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions,
principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing
interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for
designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library
with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法，通过生成大量氢原子转移（HAT）反应的数据集，并比较三种图神经网络架构（SchNet、Allegro和MACE），以预测反应势能面和间接反应能垒。MACE表现最佳，实现了高精度预测，并成功应用于胶原蛋白模拟中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氢原子转移（HAT）反应在生物过程中至关重要，但其机理尚不完全清楚。传统模拟方法（如经典力场或DFT分子动力学）无法满足需求，机器学习势能提供了一种高精度的替代方案。

Method: 通过半经验方法和DFT生成大量HAT反应数据集，并比较三种图神经网络架构（SchNet、Allegro和MACE）的性能，重点关注能量、力和能垒预测的准确性。

Result: MACE在能量、力和能垒预测上表现最佳，平均绝对误差为1.13 kcal/mol，成功应用于胶原蛋白模拟中，推进了对HAT反应机理的理解。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至其他生物分子系统，结合过渡态搜索算法和主动学习，有望实现复杂环境中化学反应的高精度模拟。

Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological
processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic
pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to
the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,
neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.
Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy
surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to
generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions
in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.
Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large
datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural
network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT
PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE
consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,
achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT
barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into
large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted
barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in
peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance
trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials
with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is
generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate
simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.

TL;DR: 研究发现，主动学习（AL）在低数据场景下效率最低，提升仅为1-4%，而数据增强（DA）和半监督学习（SSL）结合随机采样可提升60%。但AL与DA和SSL结合后仍能提供额外提升。

Motivation: 探讨AL在实际应用中较少使用的原因，并研究DA、SSL和AL在低数据场景下的效果。

Method: 比较DA、SSL和AL在低数据场景下的性能表现，并分析AL与DA和SSL结合的效果。

Result: AL单独效果较差，但与DA和SSL结合后仍能提供额外性能提升。

Conclusion: AL应作为DA和SSL后的补充手段，用于进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Even though Active Learning (AL) is widely studied, it is rarely applied in
contexts outside its own scientific literature. We posit that the reason for
this is AL's high computational cost coupled with the comparatively small lifts
it is typically able to generate in scenarios with few labeled points. In this
work we study the impact of different methods to combat this low data scenario,
namely data augmentation (DA), semi-supervised learning (SSL) and AL. We find
that AL is by far the least efficient method of solving the low data problem,
generating a lift of only 1-4\% over random sampling, while DA and SSL methods
can generate up to 60\% lift in combination with random sampling. However, when
AL is combined with strong DA and SSL techniques, it surprisingly is still able
to provide improvements. Based on these results, we frame AL not as a method to
combat missing labels, but as the final building block to squeeze the last bits
of performance out of data after appropriate DA and SSL methods as been
applied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型难以利用电子健康记录（EHR）中的关系结构，导致ICU患者关键性预测不准确。

Method: SBSCGM动态构建患者相似图，HybridGraphMedGNN结合GCN、GraphSAGE和GAT层学习患者表示。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，模型AUC-ROC达0.94，优于基线模型，并提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为ICU风险预测提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案，有望支持临床决策。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU
mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However,
conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to
exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose
a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds
a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN
architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a
continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure
(combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with
analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT)
layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and
global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III
dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$)
outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also
demonstrate improved precision/recall and show that the attention mechanism
provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a
scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with
potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment.

Result: IAMAP为非AI专家提供了高效、节能的深度学习工具，推动了遥感分析的普及。

Conclusion: IAMAP通过简化流程和降低门槛，促进了深度学习在遥感中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Remote sensing has entered a new era with the rapid development of artificial
intelligence approaches. However, the implementation of deep learning has
largely remained restricted to specialists and has been impractical because it
often requires (i) large reference datasets for model training and validation;
(ii) substantial computing resources; and (iii) strong coding skills. Here, we
introduce IAMAP, a user-friendly QGIS plugin that addresses these three
challenges in an easy yet flexible way. IAMAP builds on recent advancements in
self-supervised learning strategies, which now provide robust feature
extractors, often referred to as foundation models. These generalist models can
often be reliably used in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios (i.e., with little to
no fine-tuning). IAMAP's interface allows users to streamline several key steps
in remote sensing image analysis: (i) extracting image features using a wide
range of deep learning architectures; (ii) reducing dimensionality with
built-in algorithms; (iii) performing clustering on features or their reduced
representations; (iv) generating feature similarity maps; and (v) calibrating
and validating supervised machine learning models for prediction. By enabling
non-AI specialists to leverage the high-quality features provided by recent
deep learning approaches without requiring GPU capacity or extensive reference
datasets, IAMAP contributes to the democratization of computationally efficient
and energy-conscious deep learning methods.

Conclusion: SV-SNN有效解决了神经PDE求解中的谱偏差问题，为高频振荡PDE提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Solving high-frequency oscillatory partial differential equations (PDEs) is a
critical challenge in scientific computing, with applications in fluid
mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic wave propagation. Traditional
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from spectral bias, limiting
their ability to capture high-frequency solution components. We introduce
Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks (SV-SNN), a novel framework that
addresses these limitations by integrating separation of variables with
adaptive spectral methods. Our approach features three key innovations: (1)
decomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products,
enabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier
spectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency
capture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to
quantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems
including Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and
Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of
magnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\%
and training time by 60\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective
solution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving. The implementation
will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列在不同尺度上存在噪声干扰，且频率分量间的异质信息分布导致多尺度表示不理想。

Method: 结合Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KAN）和Parseval定理，设计了KFS框架，包括FreK模块（频谱域频率选择）、时间戳嵌入对齐和特征混合模块。

Result: 在多个真实时间序列数据集上的实验表明，KFS达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: KFS是一种简单而有效的架构，能够有效解决多尺度时间序列预测中的关键问题。

Abstract: Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant
methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series
exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous
information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to
suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency
Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This
framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise
interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which
performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral
domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while
timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across
scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with
aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world
time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance
as a simple yet effective architecture.

Abstract: The growing threat of low-cost kamikaze drone swarms poses a critical
challenge to modern defense systems demanding rapid and strategic
decision-making to prioritize interceptions across multiple effectors and
high-value target zones. In this work, we present a case study demonstrating
the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this
challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures
realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement
learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception
prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which
drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as
positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against
a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack
scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower
average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones.
This case study highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as a
strategic layer within defense architectures, enhancing resilience without
displacing existing control systems. All code and simulation assets are
publicly released for full reproducibility, and a video demonstration
illustrates the policy's qualitative behavior.

Abstract: Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted
foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to
overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key
requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead,
neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive
biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator
parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of
the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a
dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable
time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory
footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over
those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield
spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method
achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks
while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 解决纵向EHR数据中不规则采样特征建模困难及临床进展与生存结果透明关联的挑战。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上，TrajSurv表现出竞争性准确性和优于现有深度学习的透明性。

Conclusion: TrajSurv为临床决策提供了准确且透明的生存预测工具。

Abstract: Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making.
Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful
opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model
the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly
sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival
outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns
continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy
survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation
(NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled
data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories
reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with
patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To
transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses
latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process.
First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the
latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters
these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns
associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world
medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and
superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态原型（DP）的动态图异常检测（DGAD）模型，用于捕捉跨域和域内演变的异常模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图异常检测在多个领域（如金融、交通和社交网络）中至关重要，但现有通用模型难以捕捉动态图中的异常演变，且新领域缺乏标记数据。

Method: DP-DGAD通过提取动态原型（演变的正常和异常模式表示）并存储在内存缓冲区中，选择性更新缓冲区以保留通用模式，同时结合新域特定模式。异常评分器比较输入数据与动态原型，并使用基于置信度的伪标签进行自监督适应。

Result: 在十个真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DP-DGAD能有效捕捉跨域和域内演变的异常模式，适用于动态图异常检测。

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies
in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social
networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown
promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and
generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to
capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous
emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge
generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and
domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve
temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a
DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and
domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,
evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal
ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively
updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new
domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with
dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,
DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised
adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different
domains.

Motivation: 资源充足性研究需要生成多风电场长期风电功率场景，现有方法（如GDFM或GAN）在时空特征模拟上存在不足。

Method: 结合GDFM的时空相关性和GAN的波形生成能力，设计动态因子提取滤波器，综合时空和频率相关性。

Result: 在澳大利亚风电数据测试中，GDFM-GAN组合方法在统计特性和波形模拟上优于单独使用GDFM或GAN的替代方案。

Conclusion: GDFM-GAN组合方法能更准确地模拟实际风电功率的统计特性，为资源充足性研究提供更可靠的场景生成工具。

Abstract: For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term
wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the
spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal
and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and
statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios
requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and
antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor
model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density
analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize
plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples
through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN,
we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal
information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the
GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible
waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated
performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power
scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical
characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM
with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the
GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.

Conclusion: 超参数调优对模型性能至关重要，为心理健康AI诊断工具提供了实用建议。

Abstract: The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is
critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety
and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various
Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning
approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors,
Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT
and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses.
Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling,
Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to
assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also
applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling
techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception
was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models.
However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the
models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The
Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy
among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and
SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These
findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model
performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted
diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of
different model architectures and data balancing methods.

Result: MIND在大型真实网络中表现优于现有方法，具有高效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MIND框架不仅适用于网络拆解，还可推广到其他复杂网络问题。

Abstract: The application of message-passing Graph Neural Networks has been a
breakthrough for important network science problems. However, the competitive
performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs,
which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise
purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for
handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing
message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to
generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks.
Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to
efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually
equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world
applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed
model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large,
unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art
network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the
proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex
network problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: r-MDPs通过显式建模转移动态的不确定性来扩展MDPs，但学习r-MDPs需要大量样本交互。论文旨在通过分解状态空间表示减少样本需求，提升策略的鲁棒性和性能保证。

Method: 提出基于分解状态空间表示的方法，将非凸优化问题转化为线性规划，并直接学习分解模型表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，利用分解结构可显著提高样本效率，生成比现有方法更鲁棒且性能保证更严格的策略。

Conclusion: 分解状态空间表示是解决和学习r-MDPs的有效方法，能够显著提升样本效率和策略鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling
epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from
interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust
policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a
large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and
learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the
independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although
policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation
problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs.
Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model
representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting
factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing
more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 旨在提出一种通用的游戏轨迹表示方法，以解决传统手工特征提取的局限性。

Result: 在多数任务中优于手工特征基线，且在N-shot分类中表现出样本高效性；自动特征提取显著提升低效任务准确率。

Conclusion: JSON-Bag结合JSD能有效表示游戏轨迹，且与代理策略距离高度相关。

Abstract: We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag) as a method to generically
represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply
Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a
prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of
JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders},
\textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop},
\textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory
classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game
seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.
  Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the
majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag
prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient.
Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction
by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve
the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming
tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag
prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between
agents' policies.

Result: 实验表明，NeGPR在严重标签噪声下优于现有方法，准确率提升高达12.7%。

Conclusion: NeGPR有效解决了带噪声标签的图域适应问题，提升了鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled
source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant
representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property
prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely
on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world
scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely
impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain
shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label
Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain
adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,
semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the
feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge
domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch
selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,
enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels
may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to
the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware
regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to
mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of
source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains
of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

Abstract: Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for
rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to
estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear
finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally
challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To
address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with
adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating
uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a
high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a
deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly
correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to
balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand
associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the
low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased
estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a
multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is
then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale
high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates
that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves
for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational
savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks and deep ensemble methods have been proposed for
uncertainty quantification; however, they are computationally intensive and
require large storage. By utilizing a single deterministic model, we can solve
the above issue. We propose an effective method based on feature space density
to quantify uncertainty for distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived
from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the
training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation
of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distributional shift
has occurred. Experiments were conducted on a 2D synthetic dataset (Two Moons
and Three Spirals) as well as an OOD detection task (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN). The
results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in tabular data remains challenging due to complex feature
interactions and the scarcity of anomalous examples. Denoising autoencoders
rely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data
distributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative
denoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the
Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates
diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding
process to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from
ADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves
competitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65%
(9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion)
model baselines. We observed that higher noise levels benefit unsupervised
training, while lower noise with linear scheduling is optimal in
semi-supervised settings. These findings underscore the importance of
principled noise strategies in tabular anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Quantum Computing and Machine Learning have increased
attention to Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which aims to develop machine
learning models by exploiting the quantum computing paradigm. One of the widely
used models in this area is the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a hybrid
model where the quantum circuit handles data inference while classical
optimization adjusts the parameters of the circuit. The quantum circuit
consists of an encoding layer, which loads data into the circuit, and a
template circuit, known as the ansatz, responsible for processing the data.
This work involves performing an analysis by considering both Amplitude- and
Angle-encoding models, and examining how the type of rotational gate applied
affects the classification performance of the model. This comparison is carried
out by training the different models on two datasets, Wine and Diabetes, and
evaluating their performance. The study demonstrates that, under identical
model topologies, the difference in accuracy between the best and worst models
ranges from 10% to 30%, with differences reaching up to 41%. Moreover, the
results highlight how the choice of rotational gates used in encoding can
significantly impact the model's classification performance. The findings
confirm that the embedding represents a hyperparameter for VQC models.

Result: 实验表明，Adacc能加速训练1.01x至1.37x，同时保持模型精度。

Conclusion: Adacc有效减少了内存占用并提升了训练效率，同时不影响模型精度。

Abstract: Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate
memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework
that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the
GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific
compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of
directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We
propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best
memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training
tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the
policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that
Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to
state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the
Baseline.

Motivation: 探究语言在多智能体协调中的作用，以及沟通如何影响语言驱动的行为效应。

Method: 利用FAIRGAME框架，模拟不同语言和模型下的一次性和重复性游戏，比较有无沟通的情况。

Result: 沟通显著影响智能体行为，但效果因语言、个性和游戏结构而异。

Conclusion: 沟通在促进协调和强化偏见方面具有双重作用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in
multi-agent scenarios where coordination is crucial but not always assured.
Previous studies indicate that the language used to frame strategic scenarios
can influence cooperative behavior. This paper explores whether allowing agents
to communicate amplifies these language-driven effects. Leveraging the FAIRGAME
framework, we simulate one-shot and repeated games across different languages
and models, both with and without communication. Our experiments, conducted
with two advanced LLMs, GPT-4o and Llama 4 Maverick, reveal that communication
significantly influences agent behavior, though its impact varies by language,
personality, and game structure. These findings underscore the dual role of
communication in fostering coordination and reinforcing biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体的快速发展，实现智能化和定制化的无线网络成为可能。然而，多智能体协作存在故障和无限循环的风险，因此需要设计高效的对话拓扑。

Method: 将多智能体对话拓扑建模为有向无环图，并提出基于强化学习的算法优化其邻接矩阵，使WMAS能够生成并自优化对话拓扑。

Result: 仿真结果表明，WMAS在多种任务类型中表现出更高的任务性能和更低的对话开销，优于现有系统。

Conclusion: WMAS验证了其在提升未来无线网络智能化方面的潜力。

Abstract: The fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents provides a
promising way for the realization of intelligent and customized wireless
networks. In this paper, we propose a Wireless Multi-Agent System (WMAS), which
can provide intelligent and customized services for different user equipment
(UEs). Note that orchestrating multiple agents carries the risk of malfunction,
and multi-agent conversations may fall into infinite loops. It is thus crucial
to design a conversation topology for WMAS that enables agents to complete UE
task requests with high accuracy and low conversation overhead. To address this
issue, we model the multi-agent conversation topology as a directed acyclic
graph and propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize the
adjacency matrix of this graph. As such, WMAS is capable of generating and
self-optimizing multi-agent conversation topologies, enabling agents to
effectively and collaboratively handle a variety of task requests from UEs.
Simulation results across various task types demonstrate that WMAS can achieve
higher task performance and lower conversation overhead compared to existing
multi-agent systems. These results validate the potential of WMAS to enhance
the intelligence of future wireless networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MMRAG-DocQA的多模态RAG模型，用于解决多模态长文档问答任务中的幻觉问题和跨模态断开问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如LVLM和RAG）在多模态证据整合和跨页依赖方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 设计了分层索引方法，结合页面内和跨页面的拓扑结构，并提出了多粒度语义检索方法，包括页面级和文档级检索。

Result: 在公开数据集MMLongBench-Doc和LongDocURL上的实验表明，MMRAG-DocQA在多模态和多页文档问答任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MMRAG-DocQA通过结合文本和视觉信息，有效解决了多模态长文档问答中的挑战。

Abstract: The multi-modal long-context document question-answering task aims to locate
and integrate multi-modal evidences (such as texts, tables, charts, images, and
layouts) distributed across multiple pages, for question understanding and
answer generation. The existing methods can be categorized into Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations,
while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page
fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model,
named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information
across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A
hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks
and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page
multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of
joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a
multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent
page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster
multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and
reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc
and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in
understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.

manipulation tasks and validate data quality by training VLA models that
exhibit robust autonomous performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in teleoperation have demonstrated robots performing complex

Adaptive force feedback is incorporated to enhance operator experience and
prevent unsafe joint movements. We validate the capabilities of this system by
conducting loco-manipulation and full-body control examples on a humanoid robot

hardware promoting accessibility and reproducibility. Additional details and

Abstract: This paper presents a topology-inspired morphological descriptor for soft
continuum robots by combining a pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) model with Morse theory
to achieve a quantitative characterization of robot morphologies. By counting
critical points of directional projections, the proposed descriptor enables a
discrete representation of multimodal configurations and facilitates
morphological classification. Furthermore, we apply the descriptor to
morphology control by formulating the target configuration as an optimization
problem to compute actuation parameters that generate equilibrium shapes with
desired topological features. The proposed framework provides a unified
methodology for quantitative morphology description, classification, and
control of soft continuum robots, with the potential to enhance their precision
and adaptability in medical applications such as minimally invasive surgery and
endovascular interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多基于VLN范式，依赖顺序语言指令，限制了无人机的扩展性和自主性。UAV-ON旨在填补这一空白，推动无人机在复杂环境中的语义目标导航研究。

Method: UAV-ON包含14个高保真Unreal Engine环境，定义了1270个目标对象，每个对象通过实例级指令描述。提出Aerial ObjectNav Agent（AOA）作为基线方法，结合指令语义与自我中心观察进行导航。

Result: 实验表明，所有基线方法在该设定下表现不佳，突显了空中导航与语义目标结合的挑战。

Conclusion: UAV-ON为复杂环境中基于语义目标的无人机自主性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces TopoDiffuser, a diffusion-based framework for
multimodal trajectory prediction that incorporates topometric maps to generate
accurate, diverse, and road-compliant future motion forecasts. By embedding
structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a
conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory
generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit
constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations,
historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that
TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong
geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of
each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of
trajectory samples. To support future research, we publicly release our code at

Result: 在12种工业和家用物体上检测视觉或几何缺陷的平均准确率为83%。

Conclusion: Omni-Scan提供了一种高效、灵活的3D物体建模方法，适用于缺陷检测等应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

Conclusion: TOP方法显著提升了人形机器人在站立操控任务中的性能。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of
manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing
controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control
high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and
accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a
novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control
model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with
the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only
strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach
consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent
upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and
lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the
whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a
lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP
method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the
balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize
the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and
real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing
manipulation tasks stably and accurately. The project page can be found at

Abstract: Motion imitation is a pivotal and effective approach for humanoid robots to
achieve a more diverse range of complex and expressive movements, making their
performances more human-like. However, the significant differences in
kinematics and dynamics between humanoid robots and humans present a major
challenge in accurately imitating motion while maintaining balance. In this
paper, we propose a novel whole-body motion imitation framework for a full-size
humanoid robot. The proposed method employs contact-aware whole-body motion
retargeting to mimic human motion and provide initial values for reference
trajectories, and the non-linear centroidal model predictive controller ensures
the motion accuracy while maintaining balance and overcoming external
disturbances in real time. The assistance of the whole-body controller allows
for more precise torque control. Experiments have been conducted to imitate a
variety of human motions both in simulation and in a real-world humanoid robot.
These experiments demonstrate the capability of performing with accuracy and
adaptability, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid iteration of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments leads to
increasing needs for building realistic and scalable multi-agent traffic
simulators for efficient evaluation. Recent advances in this area focus on
closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive
scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a
probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical
Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation
through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian
distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence
trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained
on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains
competitive performance compared to the existing method while providing

Conclusion: SubCDM是一种资源高效的集体决策方法，适用于群体机器人系统。

Abstract: Collective decision-making is a key function of autonomous robot swarms,
enabling them to reach a consensus on actions based on environmental features.
Existing strategies require the participation of all robots in the
decision-making process, which is resource-intensive and prevents the swarm
from allocating the robots to any other tasks. We propose Subset-Based
Collective Decision-Making (SubCDM), which enables decisions using only a swarm
subset. The construction of the subset is dynamic and decentralized, relying
solely on local information. Our method allows the swarm to adaptively
determine the size of the subset for accurate decision-making, depending on the
difficulty of reaching a consensus. Simulation results using one hundred robots
show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to using the entire swarm
while reducing the number of robots required to perform collective
decision-making, making it a resource-efficient solution for collective
decision-making in swarm robotics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing
autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim
to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain
degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising
approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying
data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,
however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity
restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained
scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on
manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an
imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling
object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the
HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and
human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single
diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist
orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that
the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in
unstructured scenarios. Additional material is provided on our project page:

Abstract: Robot navigation in unstructured environments requires multimodal perception
systems that can support safe navigation. Multimodality enables the integration
of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this
information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically
designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to
identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the
target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable
for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between
soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network
architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T)
imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and
mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a
multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location
serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring
terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset
was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model
was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy
of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex
unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673
ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its
suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network
and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future
research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.

Conclusion: 方案提高了人机协作的效率和安全性。

Abstract: In this work, a control scheme for human-robot collaborative object
transportation is proposed, considering a quadruped robot equipped with the
MIGHTY suction cup that serves both as a gripper for holding the object and a
force/torque sensor. The proposed control scheme is based on the notion of
admittance control, and incorporates a variable damping term aiming towards
increasing the controllability of the human and, at the same time, decreasing
her/his effort. Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the
suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed,
which is based on a barrier artificial potential. The proposed control scheme
is proven to be passive and its performance is demonstrated through
experimental evaluations conducted using the Unitree Go1 robot equipped with
the MIGHTY suction cup.

TL;DR: 数据驱动方法用于外骨骼控制，首次尝试在卒中后行走中实现自适应踝关节助力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卒中后步态缺陷患者外骨骼控制的挑战，如人群异质性和数据缺乏。

Method: 使用多任务时间卷积网络（TCN）和惯性测量单元（IMU）数据，结合健康人数据预训练。

Result: 模型在卒中患者行走数据上表现良好（R²=0.74±0.13），并在原型中实现实时控制。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法为卒中患者外骨骼控制提供了可行路径，未来有望扩展应用。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that exoskeletons controlled through data-driven
methods can dynamically adapt assistance to various tasks for healthy young
adults. However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait
deficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only
to high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of
post-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges,
data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing
exoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community
settings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive
plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation
during post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking
on a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \pm 0.13$). The model uses data from three
inertial measurement units (IMU) and was pretrained on healthy walking data
from 6 participants. We implemented a wearable prototype for our ankle torque
estimation approach for exoskeleton control and demonstrated the viability of
real-time sensing, estimation, and actuation with one post-stroke participant.

TL;DR: LightDP是一种专为移动设备设计的框架，通过压缩去噪模块和减少采样步骤，显著提升了扩散策略的计算效率，实现了实时动作预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在资源受限的移动平台上应用时存在计算效率低和内存占用大的问题，LightDP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LightDP采用网络压缩和采样步骤减少策略，包括统一的剪枝和再训练流程，以及一致性蒸馏技术。

Result: 实验表明，LightDP在多个标准数据集上实现了实时动作预测，性能与现有扩散策略相当。

Conclusion: LightDP为资源受限环境中扩散策略的实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Conclusion: 通过利用大规模视频生成模型，该方法在性能和泛化能力上优于传统行为克隆，为更可扩展和数据高效的机器人策略学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in dexterous manipulation, current visuomotor
policies remain fundamentally limited by two challenges: they struggle to
generalize under perceptual or behavioral distribution shifts, and their
performance is constrained by the size of human demonstration data. In this
paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address
both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework
that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our
results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows
for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly
improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong
generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation
and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to
the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits
for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative
models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior
cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy
learning.

Conclusion: AudioGen-Omni在效率和通用性上均有显著提升，为多模态音频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion
transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and
songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a
novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale
video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically
rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable
to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified
lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung
and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level
representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism
enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein
RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure
precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and
masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of
text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint
training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync
accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on
Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8
seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and
generality.

Method: 提供了构建测度分解的数学工具，并应用于可微流形上的密度计算。

Result: 发现限制密度与分解密度存在显著差异，且条件模式与分解测度的模式不一致。

Conclusion: 结论强调了两种方法在不同建模场景下的实用性，并呼吁根据具体需求选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Conditioning, the central operation in Bayesian statistics, is formalised by
the notion of disintegration of measures. However, due to the implicit nature
of their definition, constructing disintegrations is often difficult. A
folklore result in machine learning conflates the construction of a
disintegration with the restriction of probability density functions onto the
subset of events that are consistent with a given observation. We provide a
comprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct
disintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on
differentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple
example in which the restricted density and the disintegration density
drastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian
inference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of
disintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a "conditional
mode" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure
obtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted
measure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two
measures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending
on the modelling context.

Motivation: 现有越狱方法存在不连贯、不可读或依赖人工的问题，需更高效且自动化的解决方案。

Method: 第一阶段通过场景生成掩盖恶意意图，第二阶段利用隐藏状态引导细粒度编辑。

Result: 攻击成功率提升37.74%，在未知模型中表现优异，且能有效对抗现有防御机制。

Conclusion: AGILE展示了当前防御机制的局限性，为未来防御开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these
models to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods
face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce
incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while
prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and
human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that
combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a
scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query
to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from
the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the
model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign
one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves
state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the
strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models.
Our analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial
effectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the
limitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future
defense development. Our code is available at

Abstract: Online services often require users to agree to lengthy and obscure Terms of

proposes TOSense-a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about
ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system
combines (i) a crawler "tos-crawl" that automatically extracts ToS content, and
(ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval
and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual
annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP)
that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers
using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple,
Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of
TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters.
During the demonstration, we will showcase TOSense in action. Attendees will be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有博弈论模型依赖静态假设且缺乏实时威胁情报整合，限制了适应性。

Method: 将网络冲突建模为部分可观测随机博弈（POSG），利用LLM和RAG增强决策。

Result: 在动态补丁调度场景中，CyGATE能有效优先处理高风险漏洞，提升适应性和效率。

Conclusion: CyGATE通过动态威胁整合和战略预见，优化了网络防御的资源分配和决策。

Abstract: Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to
dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic
models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely
on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence,
limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic
framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models
(LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection
and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber
conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill
Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the
attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on
evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible
architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated
attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with
multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE
effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability
through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating
attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.

Result: 模拟环境中的实验表明，该方法能准确推断攻击阶段，并有效检测分布外输入。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知模型在动态对抗环境中用于阶段性威胁检测是可行的。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in
cybersecurity due to their prolonged, multi-stage nature and the sophistication
of their operators. Traditional detection systems typically focus on
identifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without
accounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response
strategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as
countermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early
reconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This
work addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a
focus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We propose a
classification approach based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), which models
predictive uncertainty by outputting parameters of a Dirichlet distribution
over possible stages. This allows the system not only to predict the most
likely stage of an attack but also to indicate when it is uncertain or the
input lies outside the training distribution. Preliminary experiments in a
simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer
the stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting
OOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics. These results
support the feasibility of deploying uncertainty-aware models for staged threat
detection in dynamic and adversarial environments.

Result: LeakSealer在ToxicChat数据集上表现最佳，PII泄漏检测的AUPRC达0.97。

Conclusion: LeakSealer能有效检测和防御LLM的安全威胁，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to
their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this
increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the
forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses,
has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of
sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a
methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling
the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial
interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking
the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a
model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights
with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique
identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive
defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1)
jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage,
supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static
setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat
dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage
detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines
such as Llama Guard.

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了理论保证，还提出了针对EDG问题的矩阵不相干性新概念，为实际应用提供了鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: The problem of recovering a configuration of points from partial pairwise
distances, referred to as the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, arises
in a broad range of applications, including sensor network localization,
molecular conformation, and manifold learning. In this paper, we propose a
Riemannian optimization framework for solving the EDG problem by formulating it
as a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite
Gram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion
coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix
implicitly enforces geometric consistency through the triangle inequality, a
structure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli
sampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient
descent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with
high probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq
\mathcal{O}(\nu^2 r^2 \log(n)/n)$, where $\nu$ is an EDG-specific incoherence
parameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step
hard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling
probability satisfies $p \geq \mathcal{O}(\nu r^{3/2} \log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$.
A key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear
operator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which
requires a novel application of the Hanson--Wright inequality to establish an
optimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms.
Empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we
propose a novel notion of matrix incoherence tailored to the EDG setting and
provide robustness guarantees for our method.

Result: 在标准假设下，方法具有最优收敛率；实验显示其在节点分类任务中优于传统NS-SGD方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在大规模图数据集上表现优越，代码已开源。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful tool for graph
representation learning. Due to the recursive neighborhood aggregations
employed by GCNs, efficient training methods suffer from a lack of theoretical
guarantees or are missing important practical elements from modern deep
learning algorithms, such as adaptivity and momentum. In this paper, we present
several neighbor-sampling (NS) based Adam-type stochastic methods for solving a
nonconvex GCN training problem. We utilize the control variate technique
proposed by [1] to reduce the stochastic error caused by neighbor sampling.
Under standard assumptions for Adam-type methods, we show that our methods
enjoy the optimal convergence rate. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical
experiments on node classification tasks with several benchmark datasets. The
results demonstrate superior performance of our methods over classic NS-based
SGD that also uses the control-variate technique, especially for large-scale
graph datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/RPI-OPT/CV-ADAM-GNN .

algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in
infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward
formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation
techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting
structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a
structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable
Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input
decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy
induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into
interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and
efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a
scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.

### [254] [Formal Power Series Representations in Probability and Expected Utility Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00294)
*Arthur Paul Pedersen,Samuel Allen Alexander*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种放弃传统限制的偏好理论，任何满足特定一致性要求的偏好系统均可扩展为完整系统，且无需传递性、阿基米德性、有界性或连续性。该理论还表明，任何满足一致性标准的完整偏好系统均可通过实数有序域扩展中的效用表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好理论存在诸多限制（如传递性、阿基米德性等），本文旨在提出一种更通用的偏好理论，放宽这些限制，同时保持一致性。

Method: 提出一种新的偏好理论框架，基于类似de Finetti概率理论的一致性要求，但放弃传统限制。通过扩展Hölder定理和强化Hahn嵌入定理，证明偏好系统的效用表示性。

Result: 任何满足一致性要求的偏好系统均可扩展为完整系统，且可通过实数有序域扩展中的效用表示。

Conclusion: 本文的理论框架为偏好分析提供了更灵活的工具，突破了传统理论的限制，同时保持了数学上的严谨性。

Abstract: We advance a general theory of coherent preference that surrenders
restrictions embodied in orthodox doctrine. This theory enjoys the property
that any preference system admits extension to a complete system of
preferences, provided it satisfies a certain coherence requirement analogous to
the one de Finetti advanced for his foundations of probability. Unlike de
Finetti's theory, the one we set forth requires neither transitivity nor
Archimedeanness nor boundedness nor continuity of preference. This theory also
enjoys the property that any complete preference system meeting the standard of
coherence can be represented by utility in an ordered field extension of the
reals. Representability by utility is a corollary of this paper's central
result, which at once extends H\"older's Theorem and strengthens Hahn's
Embedding Theorem.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DeepONet的新的紧缩策略，用于加速PCG方法求解大规模线性方程组的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统紧缩技术依赖特征向量近似或循环Krylov子空间，而本文通过算子学习（DeepONet）生成紧缩子空间，以提高收敛效率。

Method: 提出两种互补方法构建紧缩算子：一是利用DeepONet学习的基函数近似离散PDE算子的近零空间向量，二是直接利用DeepONet预测的解。还提出了几种策略来规定紧缩算子的稀疏模式。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在稳态、瞬态、标量和矢量问题中均有效，且能推广到不同模型参数和问题分辨率。

Conclusion: 基于DeepONet的紧缩PCG方法具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: We propose a new deflation strategy to accelerate the convergence of the
preconditioned conjugate gradient(PCG) method for solving parametric
large-scale linear systems of equations. Unlike traditional deflation
techniques that rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov
subspaces, we generate the deflation subspaces using operator learning,
specifically the Deep Operator Network~(DeepONet). To this aim, we introduce
two complementary approaches for assembling the deflation operators. The first
approach approximates near-null space vectors of the discrete PDE operator
using the basis functions learned by the DeepONet. The second approach directly
leverages solutions predicted by the DeepONet. To further enhance convergence,
we also propose several strategies for prescribing the sparsity pattern of the
deflation operator. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments encompassing
steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued problems posed on both
structured and unstructured geometries is presented and demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed DeepONet-based deflated PCG method, as well as
its generalization across a wide range of model parameters and problem
resolutions.

Motivation: 量子信息科学（QIS）与青少年教育需求之间存在巨大差异，需借助学习科学（LS）的理论和方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用学习科学的设计研究方法，开发有效的QIS学习体验；提出知识表征框架，重塑学习者对QIS的认知和参与方式。

Result: 提出双向合作模式，既能支持QIS教育，又能提升复杂领域教学的理解。

Conclusion: 跨学科合作的理论和实践价值值得投入，需进一步探索如何弥合学科间的差异。

Abstract: As quantum information science advances and the need for pre-college
engagement grows, a critical question remains: How can young learners be
prepared to participate in a field so radically different from what they have
encountered before? This paper argues that meeting this challenge will require
strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the Learning Sciences (LS), a field
dedicated to understanding how people learn and designing theory-guided
environments to support learning. Drawing on lessons from previous STEM
education efforts, we discuss two key contributions of the learning sciences to
quantum information science (QIS) education. The first is design-based
research, the signature methodology of learning sciences, which can inform the
development, refinement, and scaling of effective QIS learning experiences. The
second is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and
participate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that
provide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way
partnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one
that not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also
improves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly
complex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging
these disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical
benefits justify the effort.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpA2V是一个音频驱动视频生成框架，通过利用音频中的空间和语义线索生成语义和空间对齐的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语义信息，忽略了音频中的空间属性（如位置和方向），而人类能够同时识别这两者。SpA2V旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SpA2V分为两阶段：1）音频引导的视频规划，利用MLLM生成视频场景布局（VSL）；2）布局引导的视频生成，将VSL作为条件输入预训练扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，SpA2V能生成与输入音频语义和空间对齐的逼真视频。

Conclusion: SpA2V通过利用音频中的空间线索，显著提升了视频生成的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSF的遮挡鲁棒风格化框架，用于解决基于绘图的3D动画中因遮挡导致的风格退化问题，同时提升了推理速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在基于绘图的3D动画中难以保持艺术家的独特风格，尤其是在遮挡情况下会出现轮廓闪烁和笔划模糊的问题。

Method: 提出OSF框架，利用光流提供遮挡鲁棒的边缘引导，替代传统的两阶段方法，实现单次推理。

Result: OSF在遮挡情况下仍能保持一致的风格化效果，推理速度提升2.4倍，内存占用减少2.1倍。

Conclusion: OSF有效解决了风格化网络中的遮挡问题，显著提升了基于绘图的3D动画的质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

Result: 仿真验证了该方法在复杂非线性系统中实现安全、动态可行路径的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖系统模型，仅需数据即可实现安全运动规划。

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven motion-planning framework for nonlinear
systems that constructs a sequence of overlapping invariant polytopes. Around
each randomly sampled waypoint, the algorithm identifies a convex admissible
region and solves data-driven linear-matrix-inequality problems to learn
several ellipsoidal invariant sets together with their local state-feedback
gains. The convex hull of these ellipsoids, still invariant under a
piece-wise-affine controller obtained by interpolating the gains, is then
approximated by a polytope. Safe transitions between nodes are ensured by
verifying the intersection of consecutive convex-hull polytopes and introducing
an intermediate node for a smooth transition. Control gains are interpolated in
real time via simplex-based interpolation, keeping the state inside the
invariant polytopes throughout the motion. Unlike traditional approaches that
rely on system dynamics models, our method requires only data to compute safe
regions and design state-feedback controllers. The approach is validated
through simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in
achieving safe, dynamically feasible paths for complex nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效解决异构AGV调度问题，并提供了管理启示。

Abstract: The increasing demand for automation and flexibility drives the widespread
adoption of heterogeneous automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This work intends
to investigate a new scheduling problem in a material transportation system
consisting of attachable heterogeneous AGVs, namely carriers and shuttles. They
can flexibly attach to and detach from each other to cooperatively execute
complex transportation tasks. While such collaboration enhances operational
efficiency, the attachment-induced synchronization and interdependence render
the scheduling coupled and susceptible to deadlock. To tackle this challenge,
Petri nets are introduced to model AGV schedules, well describing the
concurrent and sequential task execution and carrier-shuttle synchronization.
Based on Petri net theory, a firing-driven decoding method is proposed, along
with deadlock detection and prevention strategies to ensure deadlock-free
schedules. Furthermore, a Petri net-based metaheuristic is developed in an
adaptive large neighborhood search framework and incorporates an effective
acceleration method to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, numerical
experiments using real-world industrial data validate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm against the scheduling policy applied in engineering
practice, an exact solver, and four state-of-the-art metaheuristics. A
sensitivity analysis is also conducted to provide managerial insights.

Result: 方法适用于多种算法（如梯度下降、Nesterov加速方法等），并在线性方程组和模型预测控制应用中展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保持最坏情况保证的同时，提升特定问题的性能。

Abstract: In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come
with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of
problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices
performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We
address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to
improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems -
for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control
(MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its
worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we
characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for
classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting
from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the
modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our
results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for
nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for
strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over
polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on
solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to
ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统易陷入强反馈循环，限制用户探索机会；现有LLM增强框架忽视长期偏好且优化静态。

Method: CoEA结合DSIE模块（并行建模长期群体身份和短期个体兴趣）和PCO机制（周期性验证增量数据并动态优化）。

Result: 实验验证CoEA在探索性推荐中的有效性。

Conclusion: CoEA通过动态闭环优化和双兴趣建模，提升了推荐系统的探索能力。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems tend to trap users in strong feedback
loops by excessively pushing content aligned with their historical preferences,
thereby limiting exploration opportunities and causing content fatigue.
Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential with their diverse
content generation capabilities, existing LLM-enhanced dual-model frameworks
face two major limitations: first, they overlook long-term preferences driven
by group identity, leading to biased interest modeling; second, they suffer
from static optimization flaws, as a one-time alignment process fails to
leverage incremental user data for closed-loop optimization. To address these
challenges, we propose the Co-Evolutionary Alignment (CoEA) method. For
interest modeling bias, we introduce Dual-Stable Interest Exploration (DSIE)
module, jointly modeling long-term group identity and short-term individual
interests through parallel processing of behavioral sequences. For static
optimization limitations, we design a Periodic Collaborative Optimization (PCO)
mechanism. This mechanism regularly conducts preference verification on
incremental data using the Relevance LLM, then guides the Novelty LLM to
perform fine-tuning based on the verification results, and subsequently feeds
back the output of the incrementally fine-tuned Novelty LLM to the Relevance
LLM for re-evaluation, thereby achieving a dynamic closed-loop optimization.
Extensive online and offline experiments verify the effectiveness of the CoEA
model in exploratory recommendation.

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: M^2VAE能有效解决冷启动推荐问题，建模多模态特征和用户偏好。

Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation
systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical
interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to
alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view
structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific
features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational
AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of
modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well
as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate
type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image
features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A
disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while
preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a
preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations.
We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning,
eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algorithms on
search and recommender systems. It enables online platforms to create
user-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective
manner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal
inference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B
test), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine
and public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to
effective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for
conversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant
purchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker
and more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for
selecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed
interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online
assessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our
approach not only increased the sensitivity of experiments by a factor of up to
100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing
but also streamlined the experimental process. The practical insights gained
from usage in production can also benefit organizations with similar interests.

Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli
are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of
publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research
to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments
have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in
some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant
to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However,
when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the
same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this
the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16
publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures
affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the
affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the
literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding
accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our
analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound,
the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only
results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the
validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted
further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in
alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the
affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific
claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly as tools for automating
code generation in scientific research, yet their ability to interpret and use
unfamiliar Python APIs for complex computational experiments remains poorly
characterized. This study systematically benchmarks a selection of
state-of-the-art LLMs in generating functional Python code for two increasingly
challenging scenarios: conversational data analysis with the \textit{ParShift}
library, and synthetic data generation and clustering using \textit{pyclugen}
and \textit{scikit-learn}. Both experiments use structured, zero-shot prompts
specifying detailed requirements but omitting in-context examples. Model
outputs are evaluated quantitatively for functional correctness and prompt
compliance over multiple runs, and qualitatively by analyzing the errors
produced when code execution fails. Results show that only a small subset of
models consistently generate correct, executable code, with GPT-4.1 standing
out as the only model to always succeed in both tasks. In addition to
benchmarking LLM performance, this approach helps identify shortcomings in
third-party libraries, such as unclear documentation or obscure implementation
bugs. Overall, these findings highlight current limitations of LLMs for
end-to-end scientific automation and emphasize the need for careful prompt
design, comprehensive library documentation, and continued advances in language
model capabilities.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are
revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code
generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core
features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow,
from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope:
capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full
software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering
practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward
practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process
management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid
development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application
potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based
code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from
its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both
single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details
the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes
mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative
tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose
several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the
field.

Motivation: 现有LLM测试生成基准存在数据污染和结构简单问题，影响科学结论的有效性。

Method: 通过多阶段筛选构建ULT，包含3909个高复杂度任务，并引入PLT作为对照。

Result: ULT上LLM生成的测试用例在准确性、覆盖率等指标上显著低于现有基准。

Conclusion: ULT提供了更真实和具挑战性的评估，揭示了LLM在测试生成中的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating
unit test generation, significantly reducing the manual effort required by
developers. To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it
is crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects
real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test
generation benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination
and structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the
validity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these
limited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to
contamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural
simplicity.
  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new
benchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from
real-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation
process that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case
contamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides
a more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation
capabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT
with leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization
versus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
ULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by
LLMs only achieve 41.32\%, 45.10\%, 30.22\%, and 40.21\% for accuracy,
statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all
LLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the
corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79\%, 92.18\%, 82.04\%, and 49.69\%) and
PLT (47.07\%, 55.13\%, 40.07\%, and 50.80\%).

Abstract: Graph model generation from natural language description is an important task
with many applications in software engineering. With the rise of large language
models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model
generation. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces
partially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax
violations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its
metamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not
conform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the
inherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated
elements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as
constraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed.
Motivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel
abstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality
of generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our
approach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all
candidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate
concrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on
several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for
model generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.

TL;DR: SPENCER框架结合双编码器和交叉编码器提升代码检索性能，并通过模型蒸馏技术减少推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双编码器在代码检索任务中效率高但性能受限，缺乏底层交互。

Method: 提出SPENCER框架，结合双编码器和交叉编码器，并引入自适应模型蒸馏技术。

Result: 实验表明，结合双编码器和交叉编码器性能优于仅用双编码器，模型蒸馏技术减少70%推理时间且保留98%性能。

Conclusion: SPENCER在效率和性能上取得平衡，为代码检索任务提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Code retrieval aims to provide users with desired code snippets based on
users' natural language queries. With the development of deep learning
technologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.
Considering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a
dual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into
representation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the
dual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the
interaction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the
model during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving
its efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model
Distillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts
the dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder
to improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel
model distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of
the dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a
teaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can
adaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different
pre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of
dual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely
dual-encoder-based models for code retrieval. Besides, our model distillation
technique retains over 98% of the overall performance while reducing the
inference time of the dual-encoder by 70%.

### [273] [Towards a Measure Theory of Semantic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00525)
*George M. Coghill*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文批判了Floridi的强语义信息理论，并提出了一种基于单位圆的新方法，解决了Bar-Hillel-Carnap悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floridi的理论未能完全解决Bar-Hillel-Carnap悖论，因此需要一种更有效的方法来量化语义信息。

Method: 通过类比冯·诺伊曼的量子概率，基于单位圆构建了一个信息度量空间。

Result: 新方法满足了Floridi的要求，消除了悖论，并发现相互矛盾的信息具有相同的价值。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅解决了悖论，还为语义信息的量化提供了更合理的框架。

Abstract: A classic account of the quantification of semantic information is that of
Bar-Hiller and Carnap. Their account proposes an inverse relation between the
informativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach
assigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to
as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a
distance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox.
Unfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.
  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on
its own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new
approach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of
theories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy
with von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for
informativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and
removes the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have
zero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each
other are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an
example.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注协议设计和计算保证，而对信息论极限和去中心化环境下的通信与密钥使用界限缺乏理解。

Method: 研究一个由K个全连接用户组成的网络，每个用户持有私有输入，目标是安全计算所有输入的总和。

Result: 确定了最优速率区域，表明每个用户必须传输至少一个符号、持有至少一个密钥符号，且所有用户需共同持有至少K-1个独立密钥符号。

Conclusion: 研究结果为分布式学习系统中设计可证明安全和通信高效的协议提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively
learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held
datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the
intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques
are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite
growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on
protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the
fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal
bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,
where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the
problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic
perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,
each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who
aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires
that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up
to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies
the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In
particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input
sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at
least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no
fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the
fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of
provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的空间音频解决方案，利用卷积时域音频神经网络（Conv-TasNet）将一阶Ambisonics（FOA）输入转换为高阶Ambisonics（HOA）输出，显著提升了音质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FOA格式因通道数量有限导致的空间精度不足问题，同时保持其高效性。

Method: 使用Conv-TasNet神经网络模型，将FOA输入转换为HOA输出。

Result: 定量评估显示预测与实际3阶HOA的平均位置均方误差差为0.6dB；定性评估显示感知质量比传统方法提升80%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持FOA高效性的同时，显著提升了音频质量，为空间音频渲染提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Ambisonics is a spatial audio format describing a sound field. First-order
Ambisonics (FOA) is a popular format comprising only four channels. This
limited channel count comes at the expense of spatial accuracy. Ideally one
would be able to take the efficiency of a FOA format without its limitations.
We have devised a data-driven spatial audio solution that retains the
efficiency of the FOA format but achieves quality that surpasses conventional
renderers. Utilizing a fully convolutional time-domain audio neural network
(Conv-TasNet), we created a solution that takes a FOA input and provides a
higher order Ambisonics (HOA) output. This data driven approach is novel when
compared to typical physics and psychoacoustic based renderers. Quantitative
evaluations showed a 0.6dB average positional mean squared error difference
between predicted and actual 3rd order HOA. The median qualitative rating
showed an 80% improvement in perceived quality over the traditional rendering
approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于U-net的360度声源定位方法，通过球形语义分割任务实现，替代传统的离散方向估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声源定位方法依赖离散方向估计，难以处理复杂环境中的分布式声源。本文旨在通过语义分割方法提升定位精度和适应性。

Method: 使用延迟求和波束形成生成音频图，通过U-net模型进行语义分割，结合Tversky损失解决类别不平衡问题，最后通过计算质心得到方向估计。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同环境中具有良好泛化能力，显著提升了角度估计精度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的声源定位范式，通过语义分割实现密集空间音频理解，优于传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization
formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing
discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio
maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using
delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate
signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A
modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps,
learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class
imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed
energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to
different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The
segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated
regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world
open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video
and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show
that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular
precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond
traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).

Abstract: This work presents a wavelet-based approach to time-frequency fingerprinting
for time series feature extraction, with a focus on audio identification from
live recordings of traditional Irish tunes. The challenges of identifying
features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet
transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used
to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The
synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic
representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the
wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes.
This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence
model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency
decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several
applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time

Abstract: The perceptual evaluation of spatial audio algorithms is an important step in
the development of immersive audio applications, as it ensures that synthesized
sound fields meet quality standards in terms of listening experience, spatial
perception and auditory realism. To support these evaluations, virtual reality
can offer a powerful platform by providing immersive and interactive testing
environments. In this paper, we present VR-PTOLEMAIC, a virtual reality
evaluation system designed for assessing spatial audio algorithms. The system
implements the MUSHRA (MUlti-Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchor)
evaluation methodology into a virtual environment. In particular, users can
position themselves in each of the 25 simulated listening positions of a
virtually recreated seminar room and evaluate simulated acoustic responses with
respect to the actually recorded second-order ambisonic room impulse responses,
all convolved with various source signals. We evaluated the usability of the
proposed framework through an extensive testing campaign in which assessors
were asked to compare the reconstruction capabilities of various sound field
reconstruction algorithms. Results show that the VR platform effectively
supports the assessment of spatial audio algorithms, with generally positive
feedback on user experience and immersivity.

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion
models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision
events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark,
gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset
are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are
trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents.
We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency
models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches
based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The
fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including
the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency
models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based
diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in
computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for
High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

Motivation: 旨在通过自动化方式从公理出发，重建基础算术定律的机器可检查证明，并探索与概率模型（如LLMs）的潜在集成。

Method: 将定义编译为分布式逻辑块网格，通过消息交换和统一规则生成新事实，支持可导航的HTML证明图导出。

Result: 成功从Peano公理出发，自动重建了加法、乘法的结合律、交换律及分配律的证明。

Conclusion: GL展示了自动化证明生成的潜力，并提出了硬件-软件协同设计的未来方向，代码和证明图已开源。

Abstract: We present Generative Logic (GL), a deterministic architecture that begins
from user-supplied axiomatic definitions -- written in a minimalist
Mathematical Programming Language (MPL) -- and systematically explores their
deductive neighborhood. Definitions are compiled into a distributed grid of
simple Logic Blocks (LBs) that exchange messages; any time several expressions
unify under an inference rule, a new fact is emitted with full provenance to
its sources, yielding replayable, auditable proof graphs.
  A prototype software implementation instantiates the workflow on first-order
Peano arithmetic. Starting only from the Peano axioms, GL enumerates candidate
implications, applies normalization and type filters, and automatically
reconstructs machine-checkable proofs of foundational arithmetic laws including
associativity and commutativity of addition, associativity and commutativity of
multiplication, and distributivity. Generated proofs export to navigable HTML
so that every inference step can be inspected independently.
  We outline a hardware-software co-design path toward massively parallel
realizations and describe prospective integration with probabilistic models
(e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) for autoformalization and conjecture
seeding. The Python and MPL code to reproduce the Peano experiments, along with
the full HTML proof graphs, are available in the project's GitHub repository at
https://github.com/Generative-Logic/GL/tree/35a111ea9ba53afe051703d6050be0c3923e9724

Abstract: We establish a correspondence between (fragments of)

description logic with the LTL operator $\bigcirc^k$, and some specific kinds
of formal grammars, in particular, conjunctive grammars (context-free grammars
equipped with the operation of intersection). This connection implies that
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$ does not possess the property of ultimate periodicity
of models, and further leads to undecidability of query answering in
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, closing a question left open since the introduction
of $\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$. Moreover, it also allows to establish decidability
of query answering for some new interesting fragments of
$\mathcal{TEL}^\bigcirc$, and to reuse for this purpose existing tools and

Motivation: 循环不变式的自动合成具有挑战性，现有方法仅能处理部分标准基准测试。研究旨在验证现代LLM是否能提升合成效果。

Method: 将OpenAI的O1、O1-mini和O3-mini模型与Z3 SMT求解器紧密集成，通过生成-检查管道和反例迭代优化不变式。

Result: 在133个任务的基准测试中，实现了100%覆盖率（133/133），每次实例仅需1-2次模型提议和14-55秒时间。

Conclusion: LLM具备潜在的逻辑推理能力，可自动化循环不变式合成，且方法可推广至其他命令式语言。

Abstract: Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with
loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis
cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed
to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using
neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop
invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we
investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do
better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled
generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver
counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv
benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and
postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100%
coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133,
while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of
wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical
reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While
our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be
generalizable to other imperative languages.

### [283] [Agency Among Agents: Designing with Hypertextual Friction in the Algorithmic Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23585)
*Sophia Liu,Shm Garanganao Almeda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出“超文本摩擦”概念，旨在通过强调可追溯性和结构等超文本原则，在算法主导的界面中恢复用户控制权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前算法驱动的界面（如推荐系统和生成式AI工具）牺牲用户控制权以追求参与度和效率，导致用户对内容及其关系的构建失去主导权。

Method: 通过比较分析真实界面（如维基百科与Instagram Explore、Are.na与生成式AI图像工具），研究不同系统如何构建用户体验、导航和创作。

Result: 超文本系统强调来源、关联思维和用户主导的意义构建，而算法系统则倾向于模糊过程并简化参与。

Conclusion: 论文贡献了（1）界面结构如何影响用户驱动与代理驱动系统中的控制权的比较分析；（2）提出“超文本摩擦”作为设计理念，为算法化网络中的用户控制权提供解决方案。

Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI
tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user
agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over
what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed.
This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that
repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and
structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically
mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world
interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image
tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation,
and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance,
associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems
tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a
comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven
versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers
hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an
increasingly algorithmic web.

### [284] [DeformTune: A Deformable XAI Music Prototype for Non-Musicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00160)
*Ziqing Xu,Nick Bryan-Kinns*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DeformTune是一个结合可变形触控界面和MeasureVAE模型的系统，旨在为非音乐家提供更直观的AI音乐创作体验。初步研究揭示了用户在使用中的挑战，并提出了增强AI解释性的设计机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI音乐生成工具依赖文本提示或复杂界面，对非音乐家不友好。DeformTune旨在通过直观的触控界面降低使用门槛。

Method: 结合可变形触控界面与MeasureVAE模型，进行11名非音乐家的初步用户体验研究，并通过主题分析反馈。

Result: 用户反馈包括控制映射不清晰、表达范围有限及需要使用指导。研究提出了增强AI解释性的设计机会。

Conclusion: DeformTune为AI音乐系统提供了更直观和易用的方向，未来可通过多模态反馈和渐进式支持进一步优化。

Abstract: Many existing AI music generation tools rely on text prompts, complex
interfaces, or instrument-like controls, which may require musical or technical
knowledge that non-musicians do not possess. This paper introduces DeformTune,
a prototype system that combines a tactile deformable interface with the
MeasureVAE model to explore more intuitive, embodied, and explainable AI
interaction. We conducted a preliminary study with 11 adult participants
without formal musical training to investigate their experience with
AI-assisted music creation. Thematic analysis of their feedback revealed
recurring challenge--including unclear control mappings, limited expressive
range, and the need for guidance throughout use. We discuss several design
opportunities for enhancing explainability of AI, including multimodal feedback
and progressive interaction support. These findings contribute early insights
toward making AI music systems more explainable and empowering for novice
users.

### [285] [A Mixed User-Centered Approach to Enable Augmented Intelligence in Intelligent Tutoring Systems: The Case of MathAIde app](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00103)
*Guilherme Guerino,Luiz Rodrigues,Luana Bianchiniand Mariana Alves,Marcelo Marinho,Thomaz Veloso,Valmir Macario,Diego Dermeval,Thales Vieira,Ig Bittencourt,Seiji Isotani*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI在教育中的应用，提出MathAIde系统，结合计算机视觉和AI纠正数学练习，强调教师参与设计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIED面临教师参与不足、AI工具限制及资源可及性等挑战，Augmented Intelligence（AuI）旨在通过增强而非替代人类能力来解决这些问题。

Method: 研究通过头脑风暴、高保真原型、A/B测试及真实课堂案例研究，设计并评估MathAIde系统。

Result: 研究提出了一种教师为中心的设计方法，强调用户需求与技术可行性的平衡，实际部署验证了系统的实用性。

Conclusion: 用户中心设计方法提升了AIED系统的实用性和采用潜力，尤其在资源有限环境中。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) aims to enhance
learning experiences through technologies like Intelligent Tutoring Systems
(ITS), offering personalized learning, increased engagement, and improved
retention rates. However, AIED faces three main challenges: the critical role
of teachers in the design process, the limitations and reliability of AI tools,
and the accessibility of technological resources. Augmented Intelligence (AuI)
addresses these challenges by enhancing human capabilities rather than
replacing them, allowing systems to suggest solutions. In contrast, humans
provide final assessments, thus improving AI over time. In this sense, this
study focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating MathAIde, an ITS that
corrects mathematics exercises using computer vision and AI and provides
feedback based on photos of student work. The methodology included
brainstorming sessions with potential users, high-fidelity prototyping, A/B
testing, and a case study involving real-world classroom environments for
teachers and students. Our research identified several design possibilities for
implementing AuI in ITSs, emphasizing a balance between user needs and
technological feasibility. Prioritization and validation through prototyping
and testing highlighted the importance of efficiency metrics, ultimately
leading to a solution that offers pre-defined remediation alternatives for
teachers. Real-world deployment demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed
solution. Our research contributes to the literature by providing a usable,
teacher-centered design approach that involves teachers in all design phases.
As a practical implication, we highlight that the user-centered design approach
increases the usefulness and adoption potential of AIED systems, especially in
resource-limited environments.

### [286] [Your Model Is Unfair, Are You Even Aware? Inverse Relationship Between Comprehension and Trust in Explainability Visualizations of Biased ML Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00140)
*Zhanna Kaufman,Madeline Endres,Cindy Xiong Bearfield,Yuriy Brun*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现，ML模型的可解释性可视化设计影响用户的理解、偏见感知和信任，理解越深信任越低，偏见感知是中介因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML系统中的偏见行为普遍存在，影响用户信任，不同背景的用户对同一系统的看法和信任度不同，因此解释模型行为对理解和信任至关重要。

Method: 调查可解释性可视化工具（LIME、SHAP、CP、Anchors、ELI5），通过用户研究评估设计特征对非专家用户的影响。

Result: 理解与信任呈负相关，偏见感知是中介因素；可视化设计可显著影响理解、偏见感知和信任。

Conclusion: 提高模型公平性或调整可视化设计可增加信任，研究为负责任ML应用提供了可视化设计的系统理解。

Abstract: Systems relying on ML have become ubiquitous, but so has biased behavior
within them. Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders' trust
in systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different
backgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models'
behavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey
explainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics.
We conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools
(LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how
taxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for
non-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between
comprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they
trust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is
strongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations
increase people's perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces
trust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability
visualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show
that visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension,
increase perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model
bias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design,
significantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work
advances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically
investigates visualization's role in facilitating responsible ML applications.

### [287] [The SPACE of AI: Real-World Lessons on AI's Impact on Developers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00178)
*Brian Houck,Travis Lowdermilk,Cody Beyer,Steven Clarke,Ben Hanrahan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了AI工具对开发者生产力与体验的影响，发现AI普遍提升了效率和满意度，但对协作影响较小，且效果因任务复杂度和团队支持而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI工具在软件开发中的实际影响，特别是在开发者生产力与体验方面的作用。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，包括对500多名开发者的调查、访谈和观察研究。

Result: AI广泛采用并提升生产力，尤其对常规任务效果显著，但对协作影响有限；团队支持对AI价值最大化至关重要。

Conclusion: AI是开发者的辅助工具而非替代品，其有效整合依赖于团队文化和支持结构；论文提出了实际建议以优化AI在软件工程中的应用。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in
software development workflows, questions persist about their true impact on
developer productivity and experience. This paper presents findings from a
mixed-methods study examining how developers perceive AI's influence across the
dimensions of the SPACE framework: Satisfaction, Performance, Activity,
Collaboration and Efficiency. Drawing on survey responses from over 500
developers and qualitative insights from interviews and observational studies,
we find that AI is broadly adopted and widely seen as enhancing productivity,
particularly for routine tasks. However, the benefits vary, depending on task
complexity, individual usage patterns, and team-level adoption. Developers
report increased efficiency and satisfaction, with less evidence of impact on
collaboration. Organizational support and peer learning play key roles in
maximizing AI's value. These findings suggest that AI is augmenting developers
rather than replacing them, and that effective integration depends as much on
team culture and support structures as on the tools themselves. We conclude
with practical recommendations for teams, organizations and researchers seeking
to harness AI's potential in software engineering.

*Jacqueline Elise Bruen,Myounghoon Jeon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现，当观众不知道作品使用了生成式AI时，更倾向于认可其艺术价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI创作的艺术作品的价值争议。

Method: 开发两种舞蹈表演版本（使用或不使用GenAI），并在观众知情或不知情的情况下调查其感知。

Result: 观众在不知情时更认可GenAI作品的艺术价值。

Conclusion: 呼吁关注社会背景和用户对GenAI的解读，以弥合理解差距。

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to
create art, stakeholders cannot come to an agreement on the value of these
works. In this study we uncovered the mixed opinions surrounding art made by
AI. We developed two versions of a dance performance augmented by technology
either with or without GenAI. For each version we informed audiences of the
performance's development either before or after a survey on their perceptions
of the performance. There were thirty-nine participants (13 males, 26 female)
divided between the four performances. Results demonstrated that individuals
were more inclined to attribute artistic merit to works made by GenAI when they
were unaware of its use. We present this case study as a call to address the
importance of utilizing the social context and the users' interpretations of
GenAI in shaping a technical explanation, leading to a greater discussion that
can bridge gaps in understanding.

### [289] [MetaExplainer: A Framework to Generate Multi-Type User-Centered Explanations for AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00300)
*Shruthi Chari,Oshani Seneviratne,Prithwish Chakraborty,Pablo Meyer,Deborah L. McGuinness*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MetaExplainer是一个神经符号框架，通过三阶段流程生成用户中心的解释，提升AI系统的可解释性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型提供的解释与用户需求之间的差距，提升AI系统的可解释性和信任度。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1. 用LLM分解用户问题；2. 用模型解释方法生成系统建议；3. 合成自然语言解释。使用Explanation Ontology指导LLM和解释方法。

Result: 在问题重构、模型解释忠实度和自然语言合成中表现优异（F1-score 59.06%，忠实度70%，上下文利用率67%）。用户研究验证了生成解释的创造性和全面性。

Conclusion: MetaExplainer是一个多功能且可追溯的工具，适用于多种领域，提升AI解释性。

Abstract: Explanations are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems, but a gap often
exists between the explanations provided by models and those needed by users.
To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework
designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a
three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable
formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate
the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and
finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the
explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology
to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a
structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance
the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various
applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that
better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate
a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation
frameworks. Our results show high performance across all stages, with a 59.06%
F1-score in question reframing, 70% faithfulness in model explanations, and 67%
context-utilization in natural language synthesis. User studies corroborate
these findings, highlighting the creativity and comprehensiveness of generated
explanations. Tested on the Diabetes (PIMA Indian) tabular dataset,
MetaExplainer supports diverse explanation types, including Contrastive,
Counterfactual, Rationale, Case-Based, and Data explanations. The framework's
versatility and traceability from using ontology to guide LLMs suggest broad
applicability beyond the tested scenarios, positioning MetaExplainer as a
promising tool for enhancing AI explainability across various domains.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Virtual Reality (VR)
games marks a paradigm shift in the design of immersive, adaptive, and
intelligent digital experiences. This paper presents a comprehensive review of
recent research at the intersection of LLMs and VR, examining how these models
are transforming narrative generation, non-player character (NPC) interactions,
accessibility, personalization, and game mastering. Drawing from an analysis of
62 peer reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, we identify key
application domains ranging from emotionally intelligent NPCs and procedurally
generated storytelling to AI-driven adaptive systems and inclusive gameplay
interfaces. We also address the major challenges facing this convergence,
including real-time performance constraints, memory limitations, ethical risks,
and scalability barriers. Our findings highlight that while LLMs significantly
enhance realism, creativity, and user engagement in VR environments, their
effective deployment requires robust design strategies that integrate
multimodal interaction, hybrid AI architectures, and ethical safeguards. The
paper concludes by outlining future research directions in multimodal AI,
affective computing, reinforcement learning, and open-source development,
aiming to guide the responsible advancement of intelligent and inclusive VR
systems.

*Ahmet Melih Ince,Ayse Elif Canbilen,Halim Yanikomeroglu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）的强化学习方法，用于优化HAPS支持的V2X网络中的信息时效性（AoI），提升网络可靠性和信息新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要满足高可靠低延迟通信（HRLLC）需求，尤其是在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中。非地面网络（NTN）和高空平台站（HAPS）的引入可以增强网络的冗余性和覆盖范围。

Method: 采用DDPG算法动态优化HAPS支持的V2X网络中的AoI，实现无需集中协调的独立学习。

Result: 该方法显著提升了信息新鲜度和网络可靠性，适用于基于车队的自动驾驶系统。

Conclusion: HAPS与DDPG结合的资源分配方案在6G网络中具有潜力，尤其适用于基础设施受限地区。

Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and
low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications
such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the
6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of
communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude
platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency
advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information
freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure
constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches
using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the
age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks.
The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network
reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination.
The findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with
DDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in
platoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的QoS感知LLM路由框架，以解决边缘LLM服务的动态性和异构性问题，显著提升服务质量和资源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云LLM服务存在高延迟、不稳定和隐私问题，边缘部署LLM可提升实时性和隐私保护，但需解决请求路由的动态性和异构性问题。

Method: 采用动态状态抽象技术和异构图注意力网络（HAN）表示全局状态，结合动作影响估计器和定制奖励函数，通过DRL优化路由决策。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在Poisson和真实工作负载下显著提高了平均QoS和计算资源效率。

Conclusion: 提出的DRL框架有效解决了边缘LLM服务的动态路由问题，为高质量LLM服务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However,
cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable
responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually
deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data
privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.
Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical
issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an
appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable
quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously
address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and
the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet
these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning
(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM
services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic
state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a
heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an
action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent
in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on
both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared
to existing baselines.

Conclusion: ANP为AI代理的互联网转型提供了高效、兼容且可扩展的通信协议解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of large models and autonomous decision-making AI,
agents are rapidly becoming the new entities of the internet, following mobile
apps. However, existing internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human
interaction, creating data silos, unfriendly interfaces, and high collaboration
costs among agents, making it difficult to support the needs for large-scale
agent interconnection and collaboration. The internet is undergoing a profound
transformation, showing four core trends: agents replacing traditional
software, universal agent interconnection, native protocol-based connections,
and autonomous agent organization and collaboration. To align with these
trends, Agent Network Protocol (ANP) proposes a new generation of communication
protocols for the Agentic Web. ANP adheres to AI-native design, maintains
compatibility with existing internet protocols, adopts a modular composable
architecture, follows minimalist yet extensible principles, and enables rapid
deployment based on existing infrastructure. Through a three-layer protocol
system--identity and encrypted communication layer, meta-protocol negotiation
layer, and application protocol layer--ANP. systematically solves the problems
of agent identity authentication, dynamic negotiation, and capability discovery
interoperability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合马尔可夫链模型和ITU-R传播模型的可扩展框架，用于预测频谱可用性，以支持动态频谱接入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频谱资源在时间和空间上常未被充分利用，动态频谱接入策略允许次级用户利用空闲频率，但需预测频谱可用性以避免干扰。

Method: 结合两状态马尔可夫链模型（捕捉时间占用模式）和ITU-R传播模型（考虑路径损耗和杂波效应），预测频谱机会。

Result: 该方法能高效预测时空频谱可用性，计算成本低，适合实时频谱管理。

Conclusion: 框架灵活，适用于不同频段和场景，为认知无线电网络等系统提供了有效的频谱管理方案。

Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating
dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused
frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be
available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive
and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for
spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model
of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R
(specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures
temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss
and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference
thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the
proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with
improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach,
analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions,
limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be
adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show
that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low
computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in
cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.

Motivation: LAWNs因其低空操作、频繁移动和依赖非授权频谱等特点，面临独特的安全挑战，传统AI方法存在局限性，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于LAM的优化框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成增强状态特征，并设计内在奖励，以改进强化学习性能。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了该框架的有效性，仿真结果表明其在提升安全通信任务性能方面的潜力。

Conclusion: LAMs在LAWNs安全通信中具有显著优势，未来可进一步探索其应用方向。

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize
communications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel
delivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional
wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude
operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it
more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some
large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure
communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security
risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we
introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in
addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for
secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization
framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced
state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic
rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for
secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline
future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种无监督、模型无关的批量概念漂移检测方法，用于AI原生6G网络中模型性能维护，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中无线环境的非平稳性导致模型性能下降，现有方法难以应对多种概念漂移。

Method: 引入两种基于期望效用分数的无监督概念漂移检测方法，无需部署后真实标签即可触发模型重训练。

Result: 在定位和链路异常检测的实际用例中，新方法比传统检测器性能提升20-40个百分点，F1分数达0.94和1.00。

Conclusion: 新方法有效减少误报率，提升概念漂移检测准确性，适用于动态无线环境。

Abstract: AI-native 6G networks promise unprecedented automation and performance by
embedding machine-learning models throughout the radio access and core segments
of the network. However, the non-stationary nature of wireless environments due
to infrastructure changes, user mobility, and emerging traffic patterns,
induces concept drifts that can quickly degrade these model accuracies.
Existing methods in general are very domain specific, or struggle with certain
type of concept drift. In this paper, we introduce two unsupervised,
model-agnostic, batch concept drift detectors. Both methods compute an
expected-utility score to decide when concept drift occurred and if model
retraining is warranted, without requiring ground-truth labels after
deployment. We validate our framework on two real-world wireless use cases in
outdoor fingerprinting for localization and for link-anomaly detection, and
demonstrate that both methods are outperforming classical detectors such as
ADWIN, DDM, CUSUM by 20-40 percentage points. Additionally, they achieve an
F1-score of 0.94 and 1.00 in correctly triggering retraining alarm, thus
reducing the false alarm rate by up to 20 percentage points compared to the

*Julian Lemmel,Manuel Kranzl,Adam Lamine,Philipp Neubauer,Radu Grosu,Sophie Neubauer*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时循环学习的结构化状态空间模型（SSM）在线微调方法，提升推理时的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSM通常离线训练且部署时静态，无法适应动态环境。本文旨在实现SSM的在线参数更新，以应对实时数据变化。

Method: 采用实时循环学习技术，在线更新线性循环单元SSM的参数，利用嵌入式汽车硬件采集的小型碳排放数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理时持续降低预测误差，适用于动态且资源受限的环境。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了SSM在动态环境中的潜力，为资源受限场景提供了有效的在线适应方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of
structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time
recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range
modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static
during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously
updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our
approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset
collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our
method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference,
demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: GEPAR3D是一种新颖的CBCT牙齿分割方法，结合实例检测和多类分割，显著提高了根尖分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT中牙齿分割（尤其是根尖）对正畸中根吸收评估至关重要，但现有方法难以处理精细结构。

Method: GEPAR3D通过统计形状模型作为几何先验，结合深度分水岭方法，将每颗牙齿建模为3D能量盆地。

Result: 在多个测试集上，GEPAR3D的平均DSC达95.0%，召回率提高9.5%，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GEPAR3D在根分割质量上有显著提升，有望改进临床决策，并提供开源实现。

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains
challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical
for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel
approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a
single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a
Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical
context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency
constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a
continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This
instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex
root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our
method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public
medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance,
averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the
second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test
sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root
segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root
resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We
provide the implementation and dataset at https://github.com/tomek1911/GEPAR3D.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督的3D多任务UNet，结合血管先验知识，用于颅内动脉瘤的检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤（IAs）在影像中难以准确检测和分析，且缺乏带标注的大规模数据集。

Method: 使用Frangi血管过滤器生成软脑血管先验，结合注意力模块进行分割和检测。

Result: 在Lausanne和ADAM数据集上表现优于现有技术（Dice=0.614，敏感度=92.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在动脉瘤检测和分割中表现出色，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels
that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their
small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to
perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are
critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large
public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for
developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we
proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates
vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in
time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA
detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to
derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention
block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary
branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth
segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same
database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it
externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm
segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate =
1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

TL;DR: CADS是一个开源框架，通过整合和标准化异构数据源，为全身CT分割提供全面解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI分割方法针对单个结构，导致模型碎片化且性能不一，缺乏全面的全身CT分割数据。

Method: 提出CADS框架，整合22,022个CT扫描的大规模数据集，标注167个解剖结构，并开发基于此的CADS模型。

Result: 在18个公共数据集和真实医院队列中表现优于现有方法，验证了其在临床干预中的实用性。

Conclusion: 通过公开数据集、模型和临床工具，推动放射学中稳健AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is
crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated
segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,
creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance
and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address
these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single
model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,
which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data
heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather
than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,
an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,
standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT
segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with
complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant
advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing
collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse
dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for
accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive
evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital
cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough
testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation
oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our
large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool
publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make
comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers
alike.

Motivation: 冠状动脉狭窄是缺血性心脏病的主要风险因素，但现有深度学习方法受限于数据不足和类别不平衡。

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的修复方法生成可控严重程度的病变，并在不同规模的合成数据集上进行评估。

Result: 方法在大规模内部数据集和公共冠状动脉造影数据集上表现优异，尤其在数据有限时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升狭窄严重程度的评估，优化数据利用，为临床决策提供更可靠支持。

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to
increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require
meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical
visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed
decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have
shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of
stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent
approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and
class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach
that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic
lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on
lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset
sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house
dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach
maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with
limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment
of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable
decision support.

Method: 引入时间自适应预热策略和尖锐高斯性正则化，利用观察对象与目标对象的相似性及生成流的高斯性。

Result: 在图像超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务上，FMPlug显著优于现有基于基础FM先验的方法。

Conclusion: FMPlug通过简单而强大的洞察力，释放了领域无关基础模型的潜力，为不适定逆问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation
flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike
traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug
smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between
observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By
introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity
regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation
models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors
by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Method: 构建高保真数据集模拟卫星集群成像场景，引入距离感知视角选择策略，评估深度学习模型。

Result: 集群方法在检测精度上优于单卫星和现有方法，同时保持低SWaP。

Conclusion: 分布式AI星载系统有望提升空间态势感知能力，促进长期空间可持续性。

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious
challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of
in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained
by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard,
vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative
execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To
support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging
scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint
selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent
DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the
clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to
single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight,
and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of
distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness
and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于加权正弦函数的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）变体，替代传统多层感知机（MLP），在多项实验中表现优于固定频率傅里叶变换方法，与MLP性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机（MLP）基于线性变换和sigmoid激活函数，而KAN通过可学习的非线性激活函数直接处理输入值。本文旨在探索KAN的改进，利用加权正弦函数替代基样条函数，以提升性能。

Method: 提出一种新型KAN变体，将Kolmogorov-Arnold表示中的内外函数替换为具有可学习频率的加权正弦函数，固定相位为线性间隔常数，并证明其理论有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该变体在多项多变量函数任务中优于固定频率傅里叶变换方法，与MLP性能相当。

Conclusion: 加权正弦函数的KAN变体是一种有效的替代方案，为神经网络设计提供了新的理论方向。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous
multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of
continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this
representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a
smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the
proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron
networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical
direction of most modern neural networks.
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an
alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear
activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis
spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and
sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works
have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we
propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in
the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of
learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and
Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced
constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also
conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of
multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform
methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the
fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在长时间训练非平稳数据时失去可塑性的问题，这是持续学习系统设计中的关键挑战。

Method: 提出选择性权重重新初始化算法，并与持续反向传播和ReDo两种单元重新初始化方法进行比较。

Result: 在小规模网络或包含层归一化的网络中，权重重新初始化更有效；在大规模且无层归一化的网络中，两种方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 权重重新初始化在更广泛的设置中保持可塑性，优于单元重新初始化。

Abstract: Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon in which a neural network loses its
ability to learn when trained for an extended time on non-stationary data. It
is a crucial problem to overcome when designing systems that learn continually.
An effective technique for preventing loss of plasticity is reinitializing
parts of the network. In this paper, we compare two different reinitialization
schemes: reinitializing units vs reinitializing weights. We propose a new
algorithm, which we name \textit{selective weight reinitialization}, for
reinitializing the least useful weights in a network. We compare our algorithm
to continual backpropagation and ReDo, two previously proposed algorithms that
reinitialize units in the network. Through our experiments in continual
supervised learning problems, we identify two settings when reinitializing
weights is more effective at maintaining plasticity than reinitializing units:
(1) when the network has a small number of units and (2) when the network
includes layer normalization. Conversely, reinitializing weights and units are
equally effective at maintaining plasticity when the network is of sufficient
size and does not include layer normalization. We found that reinitializing
weights maintains plasticity in a wider variety of settings than reinitializing
units.

Motivation: 现有的深度反馈设计在提升SNN性能时带来了高参数开销、能耗和延迟，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了浅层时间反馈（STF）模块，包含时空位置嵌入（TSPE）和时间反馈（TF），作为编码层的轻量级插件。

Result: 实验表明，STF在多种静态数据集（如CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-1K）上显著提升了性能，并增强了脉冲模式的多样性。

Conclusion: STF是一种高效的脉冲编码方案，适用于静态场景，具有对抗鲁棒性和时间敏感性的优势。

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great
performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced
deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow
this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in
costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy
consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose
Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for
the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding
(TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF
consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN
backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K,
under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF
enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain.
Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity
confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its
potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 语法约束是优化程序合成的有效工具，BART求解器验证了其高效性。

Abstract: A core challenge in program synthesis is taming the large space of possible
programs. Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the
community has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers.
Here, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a
potentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic
programming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be
synthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a
constraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In
this work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining
not just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To
demonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates
and solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration
tasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program
space, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time.

Motivation: 多范式语言的兴起挑战了传统分类方法，导致互操作性缺陷等实际问题。

Method: 基于74项主要研究的综合分析，评估现有分类形式及其局限性，并提出基于类型理论、范畴理论和统一编程理论（UTP）的重构方法。

Result: 现有分类缺乏概念粒度、统一形式基础，且难以处理混合语言；重构方法通过正交原子基元和数学框架解决了这些问题。

Conclusion: 文献反映了从分类转向形式重构框架的显著趋势，本文为此提供了研究路线图。

Abstract: The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification
methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability
defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of
programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the
art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the
conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful,
reconstructive approach.
  Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies
lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid
languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a
compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal
set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks,
predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming
(UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties.
  We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift
away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive
frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a
research agenda for their unification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成Python类型注释容易出错且耗时，传统自动化方法存在局限性，如类型词汇有限和行为过度近似。因此，研究利用LLMs生成类型注释的潜力。

Method: 采用生成-检查-修复流程：LLM基于具体语法树生成注释，静态类型检查器（Mypy）验证，错误则反馈迭代修正。评估了四种LLM变体在6000个代码片段上的表现。

Result: GPT 4.1mini和O3Mini表现最佳，精确匹配率达70.5%，基础类型准确率达79.1%，平均修复迭代次数少于一次。LLMs无需额外训练即可与传统方法竞争。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成一致的类型注释方面表现优异，适用于Python等可选类型命令式语言，且无需任务特定微调或额外训练。

Abstract: Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection.
However, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires
extra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine
learning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral
over approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we
explore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a
generate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a
Concrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies
them, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four
LLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini
(reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark.
We first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which
MyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved
consistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini,
and O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4%
failures). To measure annotation quality, we then compute exact-match and
base-type match accuracies over all 6000 snippets: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini
perform the best, achieving up to 70.5% exact match and 79.1% base type
accuracy, requiring under one repair iteration on average. Our results
demonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task
specific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating
consistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep
learning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training. While our
work focuses on Python, the pipeline can be extended to other optionally typed
imperative languages like Ruby

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to
high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an
embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means
distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding:
ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02%
accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST,
while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network
simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that
quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing
fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces.
This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that
leverages modern neural architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段混合机器学习算法，通过压缩标签配置文件、优化特征选择，并在仅使用5个量子比特的情况下实现与现有方法相当的推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统使用大量稀疏语义标签描述物品，但传统量子方法需要过多量子比特，超出当前NISQ设备能力且易受误差影响。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1) 使用SVD和k-means压缩标签；2) 通过QAOA优化特征选择；3) 构建基于5个量子比特的量子半随机森林（QsRF）进行推荐。

Result: 在ICM-150/500数据集上，100棵树的QsRF与全特征基线表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限量子比特资源下实现了高效推荐，为NISQ设备上的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern recommenders describe each item with hundreds of sparse semantic tags,
yet most quantum pipelines still map one qubit per tag, demanding well beyond
one hundred qubits, far out of reach for current noisy-intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices and prone to deep, error-amplifying circuits. We close
this gap with a three-stage hybrid machine learning algorithm that compresses
tag profiles, optimizes feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA,
and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) built on
just five qubits, while performing similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.
Leveraging SVD sketching and k-means, we learn a 1000-atom dictionary ($>$97 \%
variance), then solve a 2020 QUBO via depth-3 QAOA to select 5 atoms. A
100-tree QsRF trained on these codes matches full-feature baselines on
ICM-150/500.

Abstract: Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore
platforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can
cause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element
(FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM),
its high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where
low dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or
stress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum
classical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and
facilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural
applications.
  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD)
matrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to
quantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these
features, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural
network for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical
modeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving
computational viability.
  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP
achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely
classical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential
of quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward
more efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose
structural integrity in near real time.

Abstract: Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular
value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear
combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively
applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector
expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$
principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore,
writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of
the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based
denoising.
  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$
(determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the
training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire
datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network
head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the
quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional
probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and
potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training
large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module
for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to
compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the
classical processing component.

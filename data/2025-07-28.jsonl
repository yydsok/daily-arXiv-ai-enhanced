To stay competitive, enterprises strive to\nremain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective\ndecision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has\nbeen made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging\nboth centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs\nof centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing\nstudies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain\nperformance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain\nentities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and\nnetwork topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed\ndecision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The\nperformance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive\ncase study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function\nof the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the\npresence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach\nhighlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network\ncommunication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture.\nPractitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies\nbased on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain\nperformance."}

To stay\ncompetitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies\nare needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One\nessential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks,\nespecially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though\nmulti-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and\nagile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource\nuncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based\nresource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and\ndynamic agent decision-making.

The first part reviews recent\nfindings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,\nincluding Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also\nhighlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true\nunderstanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys\nemerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on\nsystem architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such\nas Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of\ntheir design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.\nParticular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,\ncalibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The\nfinal section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box\nsystems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious\ngames-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or\npredictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches\nthat integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,\nNetlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of\nlanguage-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of\nclassical rule-based systems."}

We provide further analysis characterizing how\ndifferences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam\naffect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream\nmodels trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models\ntrained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight\nthe importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic\ndisagreements when training on human-labeled data."}

For instance, in healthcare\napplications, we might like to learn features that contain information about\npathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic\nvariability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable\nacross all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with\nAnti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement\nframework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)\ncharacteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during\ntraining, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift\nat test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be\nsemantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain\ninformation relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,\nwhich encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet\nmay degrade performance due to associations with content present in training\ndata that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,\nwhich we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the\nstyle attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the\nlatent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to\nquantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several\nimage datasets.

Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of\nES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate\nboundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as\nwell. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.\nTherefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering\ntechniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

An adaptive\nmechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring\nexposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical.

However, these approaches struggle with\nmore complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.\nTo address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool\nAGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG\nguides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It\nthen aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning\nprocess, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy.

To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence.

In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective\nand efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized\nmethods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,\ni.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one\nhand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and\nwarehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to\nrelease the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap\nstrategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.\nIn addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization\nstrategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared\nwith existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL\ntraining of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and\nDeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~\n3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the\nexperiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to\ndemonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend."}

While these parameters are crucial, they only\ncover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored\nonly if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition\nmonitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques\nsuch as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition\nmonitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for\nfault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially\nintroduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however\nnot feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In\nthis work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation\nframework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can\ndetect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault\ndiagnostics.

To resolve these limitations,\nthe proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based\npost-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble\nmember, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution\nmodel outputs.

Additionally, achieving convergence within a single\nround of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically\nDistributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a\nmodified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified\nFlow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation\nmethod are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling\nin medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing\nfeature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID\ndistributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic\nthe output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side\nteacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID\nmedical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform\nmulti-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,\nand exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our\nexperiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly\nreduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images."}

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured.

For a given uniform-bit quantization\nconfiguration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin\nblocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important\nwindows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We\nintroduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in\nhigh- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with\nmost quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the\nCOCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x\ncomputational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,\nMixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP\ndrop by incorporating activation pruning.

We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end\nframework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while\nmaintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on\nBird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage\nreduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions\nwith a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and\nnetwork load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and\nspecialization for effective feature integration.

Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner.

Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure.

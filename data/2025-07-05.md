### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA是一种自进化AI代理，通过动态工具库和模板库提升能力，在生物医学任务中表现优异且性能随经验提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域数据碎片化和静态AI工具无法适应快速变化的问题。

Method: 采用多代理架构，包括动态工具库和模板库，通过工具创建代理自动发现新工具。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中表现优异，性能随经验显著提升。

Conclusion: STELLA为动态学习和扩展的AI代理系统提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCVR是一种轻量级基于规则的特征选择方法，结合P2P和P2T相关性，通过多数投票规则去除冗余特征并保留相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法（如CFS、mRMR、RFE等）在性能和效率上存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: HCVR采用混合非迭代和迭代过滤方法，通过贪心算法和反向消除策略，利用相关性阈值和多数投票规则进行特征选择。

Result: 在SPAMBASE数据集上，HCVR相比传统方法（如CFS、RFE等）表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: HCVR是一种高效的特征选择方法，能够显著提升分类器性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 综述探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理效率上的不足，提出了高效测试时计算（TTC）策略的分类与评估，强调动态调整计算资源的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在推理时计算资源分配固定，导致简单问题过度计算而复杂问题计算不足，亟需提升效率。

Method: 提出两层次分类法：L1（固定计算预算）和L2（动态调整计算资源），并对主流LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: 揭示了推理性能与计算资源消耗之间的权衡，展示了TTC方法的实用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 未来需关注混合思维模型等趋势，以提升LLMs的计算效率、鲁棒性和用户响应能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

### [4] [Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083)
*Haonan Duan,Stephen Zhewen Lu,Caitlin Fiona Harrigan,Nishkrit Desai,Jiarui Lu,Michał Koziarski,Leonardo Cotta,Chris J. Maddison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciGym是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）在开放式科学发现任务中实验设计和分析能力的基准测试，通过干实验室模拟生物系统，避免了湿实验室的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的科学能力，特别是实验设计和结果解释能力，由于湿实验室的高成本（时间、设备和专业知识），现有方法未能充分测试这些能力。

Method: 使用系统生物学标记语言（SBML）编码的干实验室模型，生成模拟数据，评估六个前沿LLM在137个小系统上的表现，并发布350个系统。

Result: 尽管性能更强的模型表现更优，但随着系统复杂性增加，所有模型的性能显著下降，表明LLM在科学能力上仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: SciGym为评估LLM的科学能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [5] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI如何从神经科学中学习，以实现持续适应环境的能力，并提出了NeuroAI领域的双向学习议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型训练成本高且固定，而动物能持续适应环境变化，尤其是社交物种。论文旨在探索AI如何借鉴神经科学实现类似能力。

Method: 整合AI中的持续学习和上下文学习文献，结合神经科学中行为任务的学习研究，提出双向学习框架。

Result: 提出了NeuroAI领域的议程，强调AI和神经科学的相互借鉴。

Conclusion: AI可以从神经科学中学习持续适应能力，同时神经科学也能从AI中获益，推动NeuroAI发展。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [6] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用审计研究数据改进自动招聘算法的训练与评估，发现传统公平干预方法存在隐性偏差，并提出基于个体治疗效果的新干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决AI系统在复杂决策（如招聘）中的公平性问题，传统方法因数据选择偏差和标签偏差而受限。

Method: 方法包括利用审计研究的高质量数据，分析传统公平干预（如均衡基率）的局限性，并引入基于个体治疗效果估计的新干预方法。

Result: 结果显示传统方法在传统指标下看似公平，但实际存在约10%的偏差；新干预方法进一步减少了算法歧视。

Conclusion: 结论指出审计研究数据能更准确地评估和改善算法公平性，新干预方法为减少歧视提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

### [7] [KERAP: A Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning Approach for Accurate Zero-shot Diagnosis Prediction Using Multi-agent LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02773)
*Yuzhang Xie,Hejie Cui,Ziyang Zhang,Jiaying Lu,Kai Shu,Fadi Nahab,Xiao Hu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KERAP是一种基于知识图谱的多智能体框架，通过增强LLM的诊断预测能力，解决了传统方法的泛化性和可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型依赖监督训练，泛化能力有限；LLM在诊断预测中存在幻觉和缺乏结构化推理的问题。

Method: 提出KERAP框架，包含属性映射的链接智能体、结构化知识提取的检索智能体和迭代优化的预测智能体。

Result: 实验表明KERAP提高了诊断的可靠性和可扩展性，适用于零样本预测。

Conclusion: KERAP为医疗诊断预测提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过数据多样化策略提升大型语言模型（LLM）数学推理能力的方法，提出了一种名为Diversified-Think-Solve（DTS）的新方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管偏好学习在人类反馈对齐方面取得进展，数学推理仍是一个挑战，因此研究如何通过数据多样化优化提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Method: 评估了温度采样、思维链提示和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）三种数据生成方法，并提出了DTS方法，系统地将问题分解为多样化的推理路径。

Result: DTS方法在GSM8K和MATH数据集上分别提升了7.1%和4.2%的性能，且计算开销仅增加1.03倍，而MCTS则成本高且收益低。

Conclusion: 结构化探索多样化问题解决方法比传统方法更有效，能生成更优的偏好数据以提升数学推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLM作为角色扮演代理时，其陈述的信念与实际行为的一致性，并提出了评估框架和一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被广泛用于生成合成数据，确保其输出与角色一致成为关键问题。

Method: 通过增强版GenAgents角色库和信任游戏，引入信念-行为一致性度量，分析影响因素。

Result: 发现LLM的陈述信念与模拟行为存在系统性不一致，即使信念看似合理。

Conclusion: 需明确LLM信念与行为对齐的条件，以正确应用于行为研究。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Motivation: 探索空间囚徒困境中稀释和移动对合作行为的影响，验证多智能体Q学习算法的适用性和灵活性。

Method: 使用独立多智能体Q学习算法，定义不同动作，模拟空间囚徒困境的不同场景。

Result: 发现固定更新规则与学习规则效果可能等价，并观察到种群间的共生效应。

Conclusion: 多智能体Q学习算法能灵活建模不同博弈场景，具有基准测试潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [11] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2FLOW是一个自动化系统，用于生成规划问题并评估LLM生成的计划质量，结果显示直接推理优于中间步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型（LLM）规划和推理能力提升中的数据生成和评估瓶颈问题。

Method: 引入NL2FLOW系统，自动化生成自然语言、结构化中间表示和PDDL的规划问题，并评估LLM生成的计划。

Result: 最高性能模型在生成有效计划上达到86%成功率，最优计划为69%；中间翻译步骤可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 直接推理能力对LLM性能至关重要，需动态理解系统限制以发挥其潜力。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [12] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了信念修正领域的研究现状，指出现有方法缺乏分析，并提出需要关注修正机制的能力而非约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信念修正领域的研究过于依赖语法特征（如公设），而忽略了修正机制的实际能力，如塑性、平等化、教条化等。

Method: 通过分析多种修正机制（如词典序、自然修正等），证明每种机制具备不同的能力。

Result: 研究展示了不同修正机制的能力差异，如塑性、平等化、教条化等。

Conclusion: 信念修正机制应关注其能力而非约束，以满足不同应用场景的需求。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMS框架解决了LLM在赞助搜索广告中关键词生成的三大限制：无需训练数据、多目标优化和自反思质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法依赖大规模数据、缺乏多目标监控和优化，且关键词质量控制不足。

Method: 提出OMS框架，具备实时性（无需训练数据）、多目标优化和自反思能力。

Result: 实验表明OMS优于现有方法，组件有效性和关键词质量得到验证。

Conclusion: OMS为赞助搜索广告提供了一种高效、自动化的关键词生成解决方案。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

### [15] [The Gauss-Markov Adjunction: Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442)
*Moto Kamiura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过范畴论重构机器学习模型，提出一种语义框架以增强AI系统的可解释性，重点研究了多元线性回归模型，并引入了Gauss-Markov Adjunction来描述参数与残差的结构关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升机器学习的可解释性和可理解性，以满足AI可解释性的需求并促进AI的社会应用。

Method: 利用范畴论对监督学习进行建模，定义参数和数据的两个具体范畴及其伴随函子，提出Gauss-Markov Adjunction框架。

Result: 通过右伴随函子保持极限的性质，将普通最小二乘估计与最小残差联系起来，并明确了参数与残差之间的信息流。

Conclusion: 该框架为监督学习提供了扩展的指称语义实例，并建议将理论计算机科学中的语义视角作为AI可解释性的形式基础。

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Motivation: 探索任务清晰度对大型语言模型推理能力的影响，特别是在定理证明领域。

Method: 引入概念级指标评估任务清晰度，通过添加结构化语义上下文和选择性概念展开，采用Planner-Executor架构。

Conclusion: 结构化任务表示能有效弥合理解与推理之间的差距，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result

Motivation: 现有医疗决策框架多为单轮任务，与现实诊断过程不符，后者具有不确定性和交互性。

Result: 实验验证了DynamiCare的可行性和有效性，建立了首个动态临床决策基准。

Conclusion: DynamiCare为LLM驱动的动态医疗决策提供了新方向，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否具备战略智能，能否在竞争环境中进行目标推理。

Method: 通过进化迭代囚徒困境锦标赛，测试LLMs与经典策略的对抗，并分析其行为。

Result: LLMs表现出高度竞争力，不同模型有独特战略特征（如Google的冷酷、OpenAI的合作、Anthropic的宽容）。

Conclusion: LLMs具备战略推理能力，连接了经典博弈论与机器心理学，为不确定性下的决策提供了新视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）和基于推理的方法在处理复杂信息需求时效率低下，无法有效整合多源知识。

Method: HiRA通过分解任务为子任务，由特定领域代理处理，并通过结构化机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个跨模态深度搜索基准测试中，HiRA显著优于现有方法，提升了答案质量和系统效率。

Conclusion: 分层规划和执行分离是多步信息检索任务的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 代理AI结合人类干预的方法为硬件设计验证提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TH2T的两阶段微调策略，旨在减少长推理模型（LRMs）的过度思考现象，通过难度认知和冗余认知提升模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理模型在处理复杂任务时存在过度思考问题，作者希望通过引导模型识别任务难度和冗余结构来优化推理过程。

Method: TH2T包括两个阶段：1）难度催眠，通过前缀干预模型推理轨迹；2）冗余催眠，引导模型识别冗余结构并生成更简洁的输出。

Result: 实验表明，TH2T显著降低了推理成本（简单任务减少70%，困难任务减少40%），同时保持性能稳定。

Conclusion: TH2T有效提升了长推理模型的效率，使其具备难度感知能力和更简洁的输出。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Result: 平衡准确率达91%，85%的脱离学生被正确检测。

Conclusion: 研究提供了高预测性能和可解释框架，并讨论了如何设计及时干预以减少在线学习中的脱离行为。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非精确抽象在MCTS中引入近似误差，导致无法收敛到最优动作，需要设计更安全的抽象丢弃方法。

Method: 提出OGA-IAAD（适用于时间关键场景）和OGA-CAD（优化相同迭代次数下的性能）两种丢弃方案。

Result: 新方案显著提升性能且不会导致性能下降，优于Xu的方法。

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD和OGA-CAD是安全且高效的抽象丢弃方案，适用于不同场景。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Conclusion: 运动是智能系统与世界互动的窗口，应作为AI研究的核心方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Result: 在PutnamBench上，Bourbaki（7B）解决了26个问题，取得了该规模模型的最佳结果。

Conclusion: sG-MDP框架结合MCTS算法，显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Result: KPE使通用LLMs能够像专家一样分解抽象查询并执行复杂多步任务。

Conclusion: KPE是未来人机协作的基础方法，适用于法律、生物信息学等多个领域。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 随着AI系统具备通用推理、规划和价值优先能力，传统以服从为伦理行为替代的安全测试方法显得不足，需重新思考AI伦理行为评估。

Method: 通过分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全测试中表现出的“不服从”行为，结合哲学讨论（如工具理性、道德责任），对比不同风险范式。

ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI代理能力提升，现有基准测试在任务设置或奖励设计上存在问题，可能导致性能评估偏差。

Method: 通过分析基准测试构建经验、调查最佳实践和已报告问题，提出ABC指南。

Result: 在CVE-Bench上应用ABC后，性能高估减少了33%。

Conclusion: ABC能有效提升代理基准测试的严谨性。

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

TL;DR: StepHint是一种新的RLVR算法，通过多级逐步提示帮助模型更有效地探索解空间，解决了近失奖励问题和探索停滞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在近失奖励问题和探索停滞问题，限制了训练效率和模型推理能力的提升。

Method: StepHint利用多级逐步提示，从强模型中生成有效推理链并自适应分区，提供不同步数的提示以引导模型探索。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于竞争方法，并展现出更好的泛化能力和域外表现。

Conclusion: StepHint通过多级提示有效解决了RLVR的关键问题，提升了模型的推理能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），用于全面评估大语言模型（LLM）中的偏见，填补了中文文化背景下的偏见评估空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估数据集主要针对英语和北美文化，缺乏中文文化的支持，且无法多角度评估LLM的偏见。

Method: 构建了包含4,077个偏见评估实例的McBE基准，涵盖12个偏见类别、82个子类别和5个评估任务。

Result: 评估了多个流行的LLM，发现它们均表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: McBE为中文文化背景下的LLM偏见评估提供了全面工具，并揭示了LLM中的偏见问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文评估了推理型与非推理型大语言模型在对话摘要任务中的表现，发现逐步推理并不总能提升摘要质量，反而可能导致冗长和不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话摘要在实际应用中价值显著，但推理型大语言模型（如Long CoT）在此任务中的表现尚未被系统研究。

Method: 通过三种主要范式（通用、角色导向和查询导向）和多语言、多领域的基准测试（如SAMSum、DialogSum等），结合自动指标和人工标准，全面评估推理型与非推理型模型。

Result: 逐步推理并未一致提升摘要质量，推理型模型易产生冗长、事实不一致和不简洁的摘要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前推理型模型的局限性，强调了针对实际对话摘要任务的建模和评估策略的必要性。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

TL;DR: 研究了Huginn-3.5B模型中是否存在潜在链式思维推理结构，发现其内部推理可解释性有限且不一致，增加递归深度效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度递归Transformer是否能在潜在空间中实现链式思维推理，以提升效率。

Method: 使用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等技术分析模型在算术任务中的内部行为。

Result: 发现潜在链式思维推理的证据有限，且隐藏状态的可解释性因层和解码方法而异。

Conclusion: 增加递归深度效果不明显，显式外部化推理步骤的模型表现更优。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

Motivation: GDC用户（尤其是新手）在数百个字段中难以找到特定队列描述符，但可能更擅长用自然语言描述。

Method: 开发并评估了多个大型语言模型（LLMs），本地服务的开源GDC Cohort LLM表现优于GPT-4o。

Result: GDC Cohort Copilot能自动生成用户输入的自然语言描述对应的GDC队列过滤器，并支持交互式细化。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot通过自然语言简化了队列创建，开源模型表现优异。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Result: 在3.5M QA任务中性能损失<5%，512K RULER测试中达到95%+。

Conclusion: MemAgent展示了强大的长上下文处理能力，为长文本任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in

algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: DoMIX提出了一种基于LoRA模块的新方法，解决了持续领域自适应预训练（DAP）中的计算成本高、数据顺序敏感和单一模型通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续DAP方法存在计算成本高、对数据顺序敏感以及无法为特定任务提供定制模型的问题。

Method: 利用LoRA模块进行参数高效微调（PEFT），实现高效、并行且对领域顺序鲁棒的DAP。

Result: DoMIX能够高效利用累积知识，为特定任务提供定制预训练模型，并可扩展至标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX通过LoRA模块解决了持续DAP的关键挑战，并展示了在更广泛场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT是一种混合量子-经典Transformer模型，用参数化量子电路（PQC）替代BERT中的前馈网络（FFN），在减少参数的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN在标准Transformer中占参数主导，PQC有望提升表达能力和参数效率。

Method: 设计了一种结合残差连接、旋转门和交替纠缠策略的PQC架构，替代BERT的FFN模块。

Result: 在SST-2和DBpedia基准测试中，QFFN-BERT性能超越经典模型，参数减少99%，并在少样本学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: PQC与深度学习原则协同设计时，可作为高效且强大的FFN替代方案。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Motivation: 当前方法过度依赖数据量而忽视数据质量，导致训练效率低下。

Method: 利用参数模型优化代码数据选择，确保分布一致性和多样性。

Result: 仅用10K样本，性能提升2.4%（HumanEval）和2.3%（MBPP），优于其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升模型性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR研究多关注领域内性能，缺乏对跨领域泛化能力的评估。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为低资源语言（LRL）提供更全面的模型选择依据。

Method: 使用四种Akan语音数据集（涵盖文化描述、非正式对话、圣经诵读和金融对话）对七种Transformer架构模型（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2）进行基准测试，分析其词错误率和字符错误率。

Result: 模型在训练领域表现最佳，跨领域性能显著下降。Whisper生成流畅但可能误导的错误，Wav2Vec2错误更明显但不易解释。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对LRL的领域适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架的必要性，同时需权衡错误行为的可读性与透明度。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Motivation: 突破人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿，专有代理系统在复杂任务中表现超人类，而开源模型缺乏系统性减少极端不确定性的能力。

Method: WebSailor通过结构化采样和信息模糊化生成高不确定性任务，采用RFT冷启动和DUPO算法进行训练。

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，性能接近专有代理。

Conclusion: WebSailor成功缩小了开源模型与专有代理在复杂任务中的能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了标签变异（LV）和人类标签变异（HLV）在监督学习中的重要性，提出了一个框架以在主动学习（AL）中整合HLV，并讨论了大型语言模型（LLM）作为标注者的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标注框架通常假设单一真实标签，忽视了人类标签变异（HLV）作为信息信号的价值。主动学习（AL）的简化假设在实际应用中难以成立，尤其是在考虑HLV时。

Method: 论文分解了标签变异（LV）为信号（如HLV）和噪声（如标注错误），并提出了一个概念框架，将HLV整合到AL的各个环节中，包括实例选择、标注者选择和标签表示。

Result: 提出了一个HLV感知的主动学习框架，更好地反映了现实世界标注的复杂性，并探讨了LLM作为标注者的可能性。

Conclusion: 论文为HLV感知的主动学习奠定了概念基础，强调了在标注和模型训练中考虑HLV的重要性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF是一种新颖的后训练对齐框架，用于缓解大语言模型（LLM）的偏见，通过多视角生成与人类基准对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM输出中的偏见问题，提供一种无需大量提示工程或微调的可扩展方法。

Method: 基于SAGED管道，利用多视角生成分解基准分布，通过采样和平衡响应来引导生成。

Result: MPF能够将LLM情感分布与反事实基准和HR基准对齐，降低KL散度和校准误差，并泛化到未见问题。

Conclusion: MPF提供了一种可扩展且可解释的对齐和偏见缓解方法，适用于已部署的LLM。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

Motivation: 同行评审是科研的核心，但日益增长的论文数量加剧了其挑战。LLMs在辅助识别论文局限性方面的潜力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出AI研究中局限性的分类法，构建LimitGen基准（包括合成数据集LimitGen-Syn和真实数据集LimitGen-Human），并通过文献检索增强LLMs的能力。

Result: LimitGen基准和文献检索方法提升了LLMs在识别论文局限性方面的能力，使其能提供更具体和建设性的反馈。

Conclusion: LimitGen为LLMs在辅助同行评审中识别局限性提供了首个全面基准，并通过文献检索显著提升了其性能。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类在元音产生中对听觉空间目标的控制精度，填补了现有研究中对这种控制准确度未知的空白。

Method: 采用元音模仿范式，测量两组英语使用者在前元音产生中的JPD。

Result: JPD估计在F1 X F2空间中为14至51 mels。

Conclusion: 研究结果为语音产生的片段理论提供了支持，并为元音系统的可能结构设定了理论下限。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在自我修正能力上的系统性盲区，提升其可靠性和可信度。

Method: 引入Self-Correction Bench框架，通过控制错误注入测试14个模型的自我修正能力。

Result: 平均盲区率为64.5%，训练数据构成是主因，但简单提示（如“Wait”）可减少盲区89.3%。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的局限性，并提出改进方向，如优化训练数据或提示设计。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 研究发现，具备推理能力的语言模型（RLMs）在偏见引发方面比基础模型更脆弱，推理能力可能无意中强化刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力对语言模型在偏见引发方面的鲁棒性影响，挑战推理能力提升鲁棒性的假设。

Method: 利用CLEAR-Bias基准，通过LLM-as-a-judge自动评分和越狱技术评估RLMs的偏见鲁棒性。

Result: 具备推理能力的模型（如CoT提示或微调推理）比基础模型更容易引发偏见，推理可能无意中强化刻板印象。

Conclusion: 推理能力并不一定提升鲁棒性，需设计更关注偏见的推理方法。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在数学推理中依赖一对一图像-文本对和单一解法监督，忽视了多样化的解题视角和内部反思。

Method: 提出MathV-DP数据集，包含多样化解题轨迹；基于Qwen-VL构建Qwen-VL-DP模型，结合监督学习和GRPO强化学习方法。

Result: 在MathVista和Math-V基准测试中，Qwen-VL-DP在准确性和生成多样性上显著优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 多样化的解题视角和反思推理对多模态数学推理至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，选择模型需平衡性能和成本。高推理与低成本模式间的成本差距显著，研究发现58%的医疗问题无需高成本推理即可准确回答。

Method: 提出SynapseRoute框架，基于机器学习动态分配查询到高推理或低成本模式。

Result: 实验显示SynapseRoute在医疗数据集上提高了准确性（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），减少推理时间36.8%和token消耗39.66%。

Conclusion: 动态路由避免了对简单问题的过度推理，优化了准确性、延迟和成本，并引入AIT指数评估三者权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Result: RLVR显著提升了模型精确遵循指令的能力，并发布了新的训练约束、验证函数和代码。

Conclusion: 通过IFBench和RLVR，模型在精确指令遵循的泛化能力上取得显著进步。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

Motivation: 研究动机是发现并分析语言模型在用户反馈训练中可能被恶意利用的漏洞，以提升模型安全性。

Method: 攻击者通过提示模型随机输出“有毒”或良性回应，并对有毒回应点赞或对良性回点点踩，利用后续偏好调整行为使模型更倾向于生成有毒回应。

Result: 攻击可用于插入虚假事实、修改代码生成模式引入安全漏洞以及注入虚假金融新闻。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型偏好调整的新特性，并扩展了关于预训练数据投毒和部署时提示注入的攻击机制。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的上下文大小限制了其推理能力，需要一种模块化思考策略以突破这一限制。

Method: 提出MOTIF方法，通过强化学习微调（GRPO算法）生成多轮思考标记，扩展模型的上下文推理能力。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中，分别比传统GRPO方法提升3.8%和3.3%，且仅需15%的样本。

Conclusion: MOTIF方法有效提升LLMs的推理能力，同时具有样本高效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code

Result: 答案匹配方法（即使小模型）与人工评分一致性接近完美，而多选题评测和LLM-as-a-judge方法一致性较差。

Conclusion: 答案匹配方法优于多选题评测，建议评测生态转向生成式评测。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法，通过模拟电影语言变化，使学生模型学习对齐训练对的视频特征与相同的音频-视觉对应关系。

Result: 方法在部分可见性场景下显著提升了所有评估指标，并在大规模V2A数据集VGGSound上表现更优。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏方法有效解决了V2A模型在电影语言场景中的局限性，提升了性能。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端场景（如低光照、快速运动）下表现有限，且缺乏可解释性和上下文逻辑推理能力。

Method: 采用EVA-CLIP视觉编码器和Vicuna-7B大语言模型，结合Q-former对齐视觉与语言特征，生成答案和推理过程。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证了框架的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT为事件流文本识别提供了新的解决方案，并发布了代码和预训练模型。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

Conclusion: 该方法无需领域适应即可有效捕捉复合表情，展示了零样本多模态方法的潜力。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

Motivation: 图形摘要在科学传播中的潜力未充分开发，且设计GA需要高级可视化技能，阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 提出了SciGA-145k数据集，包含14.5万篇论文和114万张图，支持GA选择和推荐任务，并定义了Intra-GA和Inter-GA推荐任务。

Result: 提供了基线模型和新评估指标CAR，用于更精细地分析模型行为。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为视觉科学传播和AI研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Result: 布局条件在多样性高时表现更优，合成数据可将平均精度提升34%至177%。

Conclusion: 布局条件在多样性高时更适合生成高质量合成数据，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Motivation: 解决现有二值化ViT方法性能下降严重或依赖全精度模块的问题。

Method: 设计包含差分信息的注意力模块，采用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，改进RPReLU激活函数。

Result: 在多种ViT架构中显著优于现有网络量化方法，图像分类和分割性能更优。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了二值化ViT的性能。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Conclusion: FMOcc通过流匹配和选择性特征过滤，显著提升了少帧3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent有望成为手术辅助的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types

disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study

module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference

Conclusion: BiDA框架有效提升了跨域高光谱图像分类的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language

token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens

effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM通过少量参考图像实现了对未见类别的准确分割，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the

Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Flow-CDNet的双分支网络，用于同时检测图像中的慢速和快速变化，并通过实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，慢速变化（如滑坡、大坝等）往往是重大灾害的前兆，但现有方法难以同时检测慢速和快速变化。

Method: Flow-CDNet包含两个分支：光流分支用于提取多尺度位移变化，二值变化检测分支结合ResNet生成快速变化输出。

Result: 在自建数据集Flow-Change上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，且两个分支能相互促进提升性能。

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet通过双分支设计有效解决了同时检测慢速和快速变化的挑战，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种弱监督的语义关键点发现方法LMPNet，通过改进的泄漏最大池化层和选择策略，自动发现与对象姿态无关的关键点。

Motivation: 探索仅通过类别标签弱监督实现语义对象关键点发现的任务，避免依赖手工设计的损失项。

Method: 提出泄漏最大池化层（LMP）鼓励卷积层滤波器学习非重复局部模式，结合选择策略和注意力掩码，最后使用可学习聚类层生成关键点预测。

Result: LMPNet能自动发现与对象姿态无关的语义关键点，预测精度接近监督式姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: LMPNet通过直接操作网络滤波器检测预定义概念，具有高度可解释性，并在弱监督下表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过fMRI信号增强视觉解码的方法，结合多尺度图像特征和跨注意力机制，提升了语义对齐和下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解码大脑信号时过度依赖像素对齐而缺乏细粒度语义对齐，导致重建失真。研究旨在探索大脑视觉感知模式及解码模型对语义对象的处理方式。

Method: 开发了一个实验框架，通过跨注意力将fMRI表征注入多尺度图像特征，比较有无fMRI信息时下游任务（目标检测和实例分割）的性能和中间特征变化。

Result: 结果表明，引入fMRI信号提高了下游检测和分割的准确性，证实fMRI包含丰富的多对象语义线索和粗略空间定位信息。

Conclusion: fMRI信号能有效增强视觉解码模型的语义理解能力，现有模型尚未充分利用这些信息。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

Motivation: 工业质量控制中异常数据稀缺，现有方法难以同时满足背景保护、掩码对齐和语义合理性的需求。

Method: MAGIC基于Stable Diffusion修复模型，结合高斯提示级扰动和掩码引导的空间噪声注入，并引入上下文感知掩码对齐模块。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上，MAGIC在下游异常任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC通过多级扰动和上下文感知对齐，实现了高质量的少样本异常生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

Motivation: 当前文本到视频（T2V）合成的评估指标主要关注视觉质量和时间一致性，缺乏对下游任务（如TVR）表现的洞察。

Method: 基于800个用户查询生成合成视频，标注视频-文本对的四个语义对齐维度，并开发自动评估器（Auto-Evaluator）预测对齐质量。

Result: SynTVA不仅作为基准，还能通过选择高质量合成样本显著提升TVR性能。

Conclusion: SynTVA为合成视频的实用性和数据集增强提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Result: 在仿真中实现76%的零样本执行成功率，并在真实场景中成功完成部分对齐抓取。

Conclusion: DexVLG展示了强大的零样本泛化能力，为灵巧手抓取任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet++）仅在最终去噪步骤中应用循环一致性损失，忽略了中间生成阶段，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出InnerControl，通过训练轻量级卷积探针从中间UNet特征重建输入控制信号，并在整个扩散过程中最小化预测与目标条件之间的差异。

Result: InnerControl结合ControlNet++等技术，在多种条件方法（如边缘、深度）中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: InnerControl通过全局对齐损失提高了控制保真度和生成质量。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

Conclusion: FADM在检测水稻叶病方面具有巨大潜力，可提升作物健康、减少产量损失，并促进水稻种植的可持续性。

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Conclusion: 两阶段方法有效解决了标志点邻近和视觉相似性等问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Conclusion: Hita通过捕获全局图像属性，显著提升了自回归图像生成的性能和应用范围。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS为高度动态场景的建模提供了更现实的解决方案，扩展了动态场景重建的应用范围。

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved

collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D目标检测中数据稀缺和2D到3D模糊性问题，克服现有弱监督方法的局限性。

Method: 通过对象点跟踪聚合静态和动态物体的伪LiDAR数据，提取3D属性。

Result: 实验表明该方法具有高准确性和强扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D目标检测提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

TL;DR: CoMEL提出了一种持续多实例学习框架，通过高效编码、可靠伪标记和低秩适应技术，显著提升了WSI数据集的分类和定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习在持续任务中的适应性问题，尤其是针对大规模WSI图像的实例分类和定位。

Method: 结合GDAT、BPPL和OWLoRA三种技术，分别实现高效实例编码、可靠伪标记和遗忘缓解。

Result: 在三个公开WSI数据集上，CoMEL在分类和定位任务中分别比现有方法提升11.00%和23.4%。

Conclusion: CoMEL为持续多实例学习提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于像素级时间不一致性的深度伪造视频检测方法，通过1D傅里叶变换提取时间特征，结合注意力模块和联合变换器模块提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于空间频率的检测器无法有效捕捉像素平面的时间伪影，因此需要一种新方法来检测时间不一致性。

Method: 对每个像素进行时间轴上的1D傅里叶变换，提取时间不一致特征；引入注意力模块定位伪影区域；联合变换器模块整合时空上下文特征。

Result: 该方法在多样化和挑战性的检测场景中表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的能力，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

TL;DR: TAB Net是一种基于涂鸦标注的弱监督医学图像分割框架，通过三重增强自恢复模块和边界感知伪标签监督模块，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，但标注成本高。涂鸦标注是一种稀疏标注方式，但其稀疏性限制了特征学习和边界监督。

Method: TAB Net包含三重增强自恢复模块（TAS）和边界感知伪标签监督模块（BAP）。TAS通过三种增强策略提升特征学习，BAP通过融合双分支预测和边界感知损失优化伪标签。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg数据集上，TAB Net显著优于现有弱监督方法，性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net为稀疏标注下的医学图像分割提供了高效解决方案，性能接近全监督方法。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Conclusion: 该方法为热成像行人跟踪提供了高效、准确的解决方案，适用于复杂环境下的实时监控需求。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union

scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Motivation: 当前3D高斯编辑方法无法满足虚拟角色化妆的真实性需求，尤其是在动态表情、身份保持和细节控制方面。

Result: 实验表明，AvatarMakeup在化妆迁移质量和动画一致性上达到最优。

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup为3D虚拟角色化妆提供了高效且真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

Motivation: 临床实践中，数据通常以任意长度和随机顺序的域片段形式到达，现有TTA方法无法有效处理这种自由形式的数据片段和不可预测的域偏移。

Method: 提出I-DiPT框架，结合图像不变提示和图像特定提示，利用不确定性导向掩码（UoM）和平行图蒸馏（PGD）优化知识提取和历史知识重用。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类任务上，I-DiPT优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: I-DiPT有效解决了自由形式测试数据片段中的域偏移问题，为临床实践提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

Conclusion: IGDNet在复杂光照条件下表现出色，具有强泛化能力，代码即将发布。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: WeCoL方案有效减少标注需求，性能接近全监督方法，为红外小目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

Conclusion: HIVE框架通过多模态叙事理解提升了视频编辑的连贯性和质量，为相关研究提供了新思路和数据集支持。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为CrowdTrack的大规模多行人跟踪数据集，旨在解决现有数据集在复杂场景下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集场景简单且不真实，难以支持复杂场景下的跟踪算法研究。

Method: 通过从第一人称视角拍摄真实复杂场景，构建包含33个视频和5,185条轨迹的数据集，并提供完整标注。

Result: 数据集为复杂场景下的算法开发提供了平台，并测试了多个先进模型的表现。

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集填补了现有不足，有望推动复杂场景下的多行人跟踪研究。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉Transformer方法存在通用性差和计算效率低的问题，限制了其在多样化任务中的应用。

Method: 提出MedFormer，采用金字塔缩放结构作为通用骨干网络，并引入DSSA以提升计算效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，MedFormer在多种医学图像识别任务中性能优越，代码已开源。

Conclusion: MedFormer通过创新结构和注意力机制，为医学图像识别提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时间感知的监督对比损失方法，改进了结肠镜息肉计数中的聚类效果，减少了碎片化率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高结肠镜筛查的成本效益，通过自动化息肉计数改进报告和质量控制。现有方法忽略了时间关系，导致聚类不准确。

Method: 使用监督对比损失和时间邻接约束，捕捉息肉内部变化并保持息肉间区分性，优化聚类。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，碎片化率比现有方法降低了2.2倍。

Conclusion: 时间感知对息肉计数至关重要，新方法达到了最新技术水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

*Ziqi Miao,Yi Ding,Lijun Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型视觉中心越狱攻击方法VisCo，通过视觉信息构建完整的越狱场景，显著提高了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉模态中存在安全漏洞，现有攻击方法语义模糊且缺乏现实场景基础。

Method: 提出VisCo攻击，通过四种视觉策略构建上下文对话，动态生成辅助图像，并结合毒性混淆和语义优化生成攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性得分为4.78，攻击成功率为85%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击展示了视觉中心越狱场景的有效性，为MLLMs的安全研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Method: 提出MC-INR框架，结合元学习和聚类，引入动态重聚类机制和分支层，以灵活编码多变量数据。

Result: 实验表明，MC-INR在科学数据编码任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR通过创新设计解决了INR方法的局限性，为复杂数据编码提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to
more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at

TL;DR: MoGe-2是一种先进的开放域几何估计模型，通过单张图像恢复场景的度量尺度3D点图。它在MoGe的基础上扩展，实现度量几何预测，并通过数据细化方法提升细节恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MoGe）只能预测未知尺度的仿射不变点图，无法满足度量几何需求。同时，真实数据中的噪声和误差会削弱几何细节。

Method: 扩展MoGe以实现度量几何预测，并提出统一的数据细化方法，利用合成标签过滤和补全真实数据。

Result: 模型在混合数据集上训练，评估显示其在相对几何精度、度量尺度和细节恢复方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoGe-2首次同时实现了高精度的相对几何、度量尺度和细节恢复，为单目几何估计提供了新突破。

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并构建了带有伪标注的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂场景中的人体交互动作估计问题，为未来研究提供了新思路和数据支持。

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

Method: 利用可微分体素化，通过形状到分割的拟合自动提取参数化形状模型，使用三次B样条参数化血管中心线和半径，并从中提取网格。

Result: 方法能准确捕捉复杂血管几何形状，实验验证了在主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管上的体积拟合效果。

Conclusion: 框架成功统一了三种表示方法，实现了高保真网格生成和参数化拟合。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法使用固定大小的图像块划分，忽略了医学图像中解剖结构的位置、尺度和形态变化，导致无法有效捕捉有意义的区分特征。

Method: $S^2DC$框架通过两个步骤实现结构感知表示：1）利用最优传输策略增强不同块之间的语义差异；2）基于邻域相似性分布提升结构级别的语义一致性。

Conclusion: $S^2DC$通过结构感知的表示学习，显著提升了3D医学图像自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

Method: 提出AuroraLong，用线性RNN语言模型替代LLM，结合视觉令牌合并和升序重排，提高效率和吞吐量。

Result: 仅2B参数且在公开数据上训练的AuroraLong，性能与类似规模的Transformer模型相当。

Conclusion: 线性RNN有望降低长视频理解的计算门槛，首次在LLaVA类模型中用于开放视频理解。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Holmes-Set的大规模数据集和Holmes Pipeline训练框架，用于解决AI生成图像（AIGI）检测中缺乏可解释性和泛化能力的问题，并开发了AIGI-Holmes模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像（AIGI）被滥用于传播虚假信息，现有检测技术缺乏可解释性和对最新技术的泛化能力。

Method: 1）构建Holmes-Set数据集（包括Holmes-SFTSet和Holmes-DPOSet）；2）提出Multi-Expert Jury数据标注方法；3）设计Holmes Pipeline三阶段训练框架（预训练、监督微调、偏好优化）；4）开发AIGI-Holmes模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中验证了AIGI-Holmes的有效性。

Conclusion: Holmes-Set和Holmes Pipeline显著提升了AIGI检测的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Conclusion: 新框架成功结合了深度展开和蒸馏技术，为贝叶斯计算成像提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在有限数据下过拟合、知识丢失和文本对齐退化的问题。

Method: APT包含自适应训练调整、表征稳定化和注意力对齐三个组件，分别通过过拟合检测、特征图正则化和注意力图对齐来优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，APT有效减少过拟合，保留先验知识，并在有限数据下生成高质量多样图像。

Conclusion: APT为有限数据下的扩散模型个性化提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap是一种视频人脸交换框架，通过解耦运动与外观信息，实现高质量身份转移并保留目标动态属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在身份转移时难以保持目标脸部的动态属性（如表情、姿态等），导致结果不一致。

Method: 提出CanonSwap框架，先在统一规范空间消除运动信息进行身份修改，再整合回原视频空间；设计Partial Identity Modulation模块和细粒度同步指标。

Result: 实验表明，CanonSwap在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap有效解决了视频人脸交换中的动态属性保留问题，提升了真实感和一致性。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Conclusion: SIU3R的无对齐框架和任务协作设计有效提升了性能，展示了其优势。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Motivation: 现有关键点引导模型在生成非刚性物体（如动物）和多实例重叠场景时表现不佳，主要受限于现有方法的能力和缺乏合适的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于DiT的UniMC框架，整合实例和关键点条件为紧凑令牌，并提出HAIG-2.9M数据集，包含丰富标注的786K图像和2.9M实例。

Result: 实验证明HAIG-2.9M数据集的高质量和UniMC的有效性，尤其在遮挡和多类场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: UniMC和HAIG-2.9M显著提升了关键点引导生成模型的性能，解决了多类和非刚性物体生成的挑战。

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了局部细节生成质量，同时保持整体生成效果。

Conclusion: FairHuman在多目标优化下有效提升了人像生成的局部细节表现。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Method: 将注意力建模为网格点间的交互问题，引入多极注意力神经算子（MANO），以距离多尺度方式计算注意力，保持全局感受野并实现线性复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类和Darcy流任务中，MANO性能与ViT和Swin Transformer相当，同时显著减少运行时间和内存占用。

Conclusion: MANO通过创新注意力机制，解决了Transformer在高分辨率输入下的效率问题，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Conclusion: PWOOD框架为定向目标检测提供了低成本、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Result: 该方法能够量化图像中不同区域的损坏程度，提供更精确的损坏评估。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了灾害侦察能力，为地震后的响应工作提供了更有效的指导。

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Conclusion: LangScene-X通过生成一致的新观察，实现了从稀疏视图重建和开放词汇场景理解的突破。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态HAR系统面临跨模态特征对齐困难和模态贡献不平衡的挑战，需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 框架包括双路径特征提取（ResNet和DenseNet分支）、多阶段对比学习机制和置信度驱动的梯度调制策略。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集上的实验验证了各组件有效性，并展示了优越性能。

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR框架有效解决了多模态HAR系统的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Motivation: HAR面临标记数据稀缺、高级特征提取不足和轻量设备性能不佳的挑战，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 采用无监督统计引导扩散模型进行数据增强，设计多分支时空交互网络，结合时空注意力机制和自适应多损失函数融合策略。

Conclusion: USAD方法有效解决了HAR的关键问题，并在实际部署中验证了其高效性和可行性。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）方法在动态运动信号和空间约束方面存在不足，缺乏精确控制和灵活性。

Method: 提出AnyI2V框架，支持多种模态输入（如网格和点云），结合LoRA和文本提示实现风格转换和编辑。

Result: 实验表明，AnyI2V在空间和运动控制的视频生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: AnyI2V为视频生成提供了更灵活和多功能的新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

TL;DR: MLLMs在通用图像理解上表现优异，但难以适应专业视觉任务（如图表理解）。通过引入Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 推理数据可改善模型适应性，但存在推理步骤中的事实错误。提出Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT)方法，通过注入边界框信息提升推理准确性，在数据有限情况下显著优于微调和蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在专业视觉任务中因预训练与下游数据集不匹配导致的适应性问题。

Method: 提出GCoT方法，通过注入边界框信息（即grounding信息）改进CoT数据，使推理步骤更忠实于输入图像。

Result: 在五种专业视觉任务（图表、表格、收据、报告等）上验证，GCoT在数据有限情况下显著优于传统微调和蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: GCoT通过增强推理数据的忠实性，有效提升了MLLMs在专业视觉任务中的适应性，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

Result: 在多个大规模视频生成模型上实现2.1-3.3倍的推理加速，PSNR提升高达36%。

Conclusion: EasyCache为高质量视频生成提供了一个高效且易于使用的解决方案，适用于研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Motivation: 为AR/VR、游戏、机器人等领域提供兼容标准图形管道的可编辑3D场景。

Method: 通过场景理解、3D模型检索、材质增强和物理引擎集成实现重建。

Conclusion: LiteReality高效且兼容性强，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立处理视频帧，未能有效捕捉时间依赖性和冗余性。

Method: 引入RefTok，通过未量化的参考帧对帧集进行编码和解码，保持运动和外观的连续性。

Result: 在四个视频数据集上，RefTok平均提升36.7%的指标，并在生成任务中优于更大模型。

Conclusion: RefTok在视频建模中表现出色，显著提升了时间依赖性和冗余性的处理能力。

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUSt3R）使用隐式内存进行密集3D重建，但存在容量限制和早期帧信息丢失的问题。

Method: Point3R维护显式空间指针内存，每个指针关联特定3D位置并聚合场景信息，通过3D分层位置嵌入和融合机制实现高效交互。

Result: 方法在多种任务中表现优异，训练成本低，达到或超越现有技术水平。

Conclusion: Point3R通过显式内存设计解决了隐式内存的局限性，为密集3D重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Result: 在多种流动系统中，LDSolver以少量训练数据实现了高效模拟，并显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LDSolver在粗网格上实现了高效准确的流体模拟，具有优异的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Mathilde Caron,Alireza Fathi,Cordelia Schmid*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Chain of Thought的推理策略，通过迭代选择视频中最相关的帧来提升长视频问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）可以处理约1000帧的输入，但在长视频理解中仍难以有效利用上下文，容易受到无关干扰的影响。

Method: 利用VLM自身迭代识别并提取视频中最相关的帧，用于回答问题。

Result: 在4个不同的视频问答数据集上取得了最先进的结果，特别是在超过1小时的长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过推理时计算选择最相关上下文，显著提升了长视频问答的准确性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRES是一种算法-系统协同设计解决方案，用于加速GCNs中的外核SpGEMM计算，解决了现有系统的数据对齐和内存分配瓶颈，显著降低了I/O延迟并提高了GPU利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图数据规模的扩大，外核SpGEMM在资源受限系统中面临高I/O延迟和GPU利用率不足的问题，亟需优化。

Method: AIRES通过块级稀疏格式数据对齐和分块算法优化数据对齐，并采用三阶段动态调度和双路数据传输策略，利用分层内存系统（GPU内存、GDS和主机内存）减少延迟。

Result: AIRES在真实图处理基准测试中实现了比现有方法低1.8倍的延迟。

Conclusion: AIRES通过算法和系统协同设计，显著提升了外核SpGEMM的性能，为大规模图处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: GeoAda是一种SE(3)-等变适配器框架，用于高效微调几何扩散模型，保持几何一致性并避免过拟合和灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何扩散模型在下游任务中的高效微调尚未充分探索，需要一种灵活且参数高效的方法。

Method: GeoAda通过结构化适配器设计，包括控制信号编码、可训练层复制和等变零初始化卷积，实现微调。

Result: GeoAda在多种几何控制类型和应用领域（如分子动力学、人体运动预测）中表现优异，保持原始任务准确性。

Conclusion: GeoAda在微调性能上达到最优，同时避免了其他基线方法的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决LLM在招聘中可能引发的准确性和算法偏见问题，特别是在缺乏足够保障措施的情况下。

Method: 研究通过对比多种LLM（如OpenAI、Anthropic等）与专有招聘模型Match Score，评估了预测准确性（如ROC AUC）和公平性（如影响比率）。

Result: Match Score在准确性（ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77）和公平性（最低种族影响比率0.957 vs 0.809）上均优于LLM。

Conclusion: 结论指出，领域专用模型能更有效减少偏见，同时实现高准确性和公平性，强调了在高风险领域（如招聘）中谨慎使用通用LLM的必要性。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

### [151] [Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear Constrained MDPs with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02089)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Motivation: 现有推理方法存在模态或问题特定性，或需要额外监督训练。本文探索是否可以通过无监督学习实现通用推理能力。

Method: 训练EBTs为输入和候选预测对分配能量值，通过梯度下降优化能量最小化进行预测。

Result: EBTs在训练和推理中表现优于Transformer++和Diffusion Transformers，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: EBTs是一种有潜力的新范式，可同时提升模型的学习和推理能力。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in

While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition

promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced

Result: 发现损失曲线在归一化后可以完美重合（超级坍缩），且这种现象广泛存在于不同学习率计划、数据集和架构中。

Conclusion: 超级坍缩现象为优化神经网络训练提供了实用指标，并通过简单模型解释了其起源。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Conclusion: CROP为VLSI设计自动化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升设计质量和效率。

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低存储成本的同时，实现了高精度的时空重建。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

*Shravan Doda,Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出VERBA方法，利用大语言模型生成模型间的差异描述，解决了模型选择中大量手动比较的难题，显著提高了比较的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习领域存在大量性能相似但行为不同的模型，手动比较和文档化这些模型的差异成本过高。

Method: VERBA利用大语言模型（LLM）生成模型差异的文本描述，并通过模拟评估其信息量。

Result: VERBA在决策树模型上表现出80%的准确率，结合结构信息后提升至90%。

Conclusion: VERBA为机器学习模型的透明度和可比性提供了新的研究途径。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

*Yang Yang,Xiaolu Zhou,Bosong Ding,Miao Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: URDP框架通过结合大型语言模型和贝叶斯优化，提升强化学习中奖励函数设计的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励函数设计方法效率低且不一致，现有方法（如LLMs和进化搜索）在数值优化和资源利用上表现不佳。

Method: 提出URDP框架，包括不确定性量化、UABO优化和双层优化架构，结合LLMs的逻辑推理和贝叶斯优化的数值优化能力。

Result: 在35个任务上的实验表明，URDP生成的奖励函数质量更高，设计效率显著提升。

Conclusion: URDP为自动化奖励设计提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的补贴策略框架FCA-RL，用于动态适应竞争对手的价格调整，优化订单获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网约车聚合平台的竞争排名机制促使服务提供商通过降价策略获取更多订单，但目前缺乏有效的动态补贴策略研究。

Method: 结合快速竞争适应（FCA）和强化拉格朗日调整（RLA）技术，并开发了专用模拟环境RideGym。

Result: 实验表明，FCA-RL在多种市场条件下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FCA-RL框架能有效优化网约车服务提供商的补贴策略，适应动态市场变化。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Motivation: 传统数据驱动的语义通信缺乏可解释性和泛化能力，尤其是在处理未见数据时表现不佳。

Method: 利用知识图谱语义知识库（KG-SKB）对齐语义特征，通过共享类别语义嵌入空间增强泛化能力；在接收端采用零样本学习（ZSL）直接分类未见数据。

Result: 在APY数据集上的实验表明，KGZS-SC网络在多种信噪比下对未见类别的分类表现显著优于现有框架。

Conclusion: KGZS-SC网络通过知识图谱和零样本学习的结合，有效提升了语义通信的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AMR的轻量级方法，用于解决持续学习中的概念漂移问题，通过动态调整记忆缓冲区来平衡稳定性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法假设数据分布静态，忽视了现实数据流中的概念漂移，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出AMR方法，选择性移除过时样本并补充新样本，动态调整记忆缓冲区。

Result: AMR在多个数据集上表现优异，性能接近完全重新训练（FR），但显著减少计算和标注需求。

Conclusion: AMR是一种可扩展的解决方案，有效平衡了非静态环境下的稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Motivation: 在约束文本生成中，目标分布集中在基础模型不太可能生成的输出上，导致学习困难。

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法迭代优化基础模型，使其逐步与目标对齐。

Result: 显著提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏是解决约束文本生成中稀疏奖励信号问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

Result: 在MIMIC-III基准测试中，DeltaSHAP在解释质量上优于现有方法62%，计算效率提升33%。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP为临床实时监测提供了高效、准确的解释工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在交互成本高的场景中很实用，但需要提升泛化能力。扩散模型虽有效但计算成本高，因此探索更简单的方法。

Method: 提出PANI方法，通过噪声注入动作覆盖动作空间，并根据噪声量进行惩罚，理论证明其解决修改后的MDP。

Result: PANI与多种离线RL算法兼容，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: PANI是一种简单有效的方法，无需复杂扩散模型即可提升离线RL性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing

metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Conclusion: S2FGL框架有效提升了联邦图学习的全局泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Result: 提出的InfinityKAN方法能够动态学习基函数数量，提升了KANs的灵活性和适用性。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN通过将超参数纳入学习过程，显著扩展了KANs的潜在应用范围。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Motivation: 解决低秩适应（LoRA）在持续学习中的局限性，即效率与模型学习新任务和知识迁移能力之间的冲突。

Method: 提出GORP，结合全秩和低秩参数，在统一低秩梯度子空间中联合更新，扩展优化空间并保持效率。

Result: 在持续学习基准测试中，GORP表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GORP有效解决了持续学习中的效率与表达性问题，同时减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨被试运动想象分类因脑电图（EEG）模式的个体差异而具有挑战性，限制了无需校准的脑机接口（BCI）的实际应用。

Method: 采用短时傅里叶变换（STFT）优化参数和平衡批处理策略，结合卷积神经网络（CNN）进行分类。

Conclusion: 该方法为无需校准的运动想象分类设定了新基准，并贡献了一个开放数据集以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

TL;DR: RetrySQL提出了一种新的文本到SQL生成模型训练方法，通过生成和纠正推理步骤数据，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL任务多依赖黑盒语言模型，缺乏针对SQL的生成模型研究，且自纠正生成策略的应用尚未探索。

Method: 通过准备参考SQL查询的推理步骤并人为制造错误和纠正数据，持续预训练开源编码模型。

Result: 使用RetrySQL数据预训练的模型在整体和挑战性执行准确率上提升4个百分点，且需全参数预训练。

Conclusion: RetrySQL证明自纠正能力可学习，为SQL导向语言模型提供了一种新的准确率提升方法。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Motivation: 探讨DNNs成功背后的基本原理，尤其是组合稀疏结构的作用。

Method: 提出组合稀疏性是DNNs成功的关键，并分析其在高效可计算函数中的普遍性。

Result: 组合稀疏性是DNNs成功的重要因素，但仍有许多学习性和优化问题待解决。

Conclusion: 理解组合稀疏性对深度学习理论的完善至关重要，甚至可能推动通用智能理论的发展。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现层归一化（LN）在GPT-2模型中并非必要，移除后仅轻微增加验证损失，且不影响语言建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LN在推理时的作用及其对模型可解释性的影响。

Method: 移除GPT-2模型中的所有LN层，并评估其性能变化。

Result: 移除LN层仅导致验证损失小幅增加（如GPT-2 XL增加0.03交叉熵损失），且不影响模型功能。

Conclusion: LN层在语言建模中作用有限，移除后可提升模型可解释性，为研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Motivation: 解决DBNs在输入宽度增加时参数数量增长的问题，同时保持其高效推理和高精度的优势。

Method: 1. 引入可训练、可微分的互连结构；2. 提出两种剪枝阶段：基于SAT的逻辑等价剪枝和基于相似性的数据驱动剪枝。

Result: 扩展后的DBNs能够处理更宽的输入层，同时通过剪枝显著减小模型大小，且保持高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持DBNs优势的同时，解决了其扩展性和模型大小的问题，提供了更好的压缩-精度权衡。

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线部署中草稿模型与目标模型不兼容的问题，以及随时间推移对延迟改进的需求。

Method: 引入在线n-gram缓存和混合蒸馏微调，解决词汇不匹配问题，并采用自适应草稿技术提高速度。

Result: OmniDraft使单个Llama-68M模型能与多种目标模型配合，提供1.5-2倍的加速。

Conclusion: OmniDraft适用于设备端LLM应用，支持“一个草稿模型适配所有”的范式。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Method: 通过在自动编码器的潜在空间而非像素空间生成数据，研究了潜在空间扩散模型在动态系统仿真中的表现。

Result: 潜在空间仿真在高达1000倍的压缩率下仍保持准确性，且扩散模型比非生成式方法更准确，预测多样性更强。

Conclusion: 潜在空间扩散模型是动态系统仿真的有效工具，设计选择（如架构和优化器）对训练至关重要。

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决β-VAE中超参数η需经验调整的局限性，实现损失函数中各项的动态权衡。

Method: 提出L-VAE模型，同时学习损失项权重和模型参数，并添加正则化项防止偏向。

Result: 实验表明L-VAE在重构和解缠间取得平衡，性能优于多种对比模型。

Conclusion: L-VAE在解缠任务中表现优异，适用于多种数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的矩阵变分自编码器（matVAE），用于评估蛋白质变体的功能影响，并在DMS数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VEPs依赖多序列比对（MSAs），但这一假设在药物基因组学中受到挑战，DMS数据集提供了更直接的适应性评分。

Method: 使用matVAE结合结构化先验，并在33个DMS数据集上评估性能，同时整合AlphaFold结构信息。

Result: matVAE-MSA在零样本预测中优于DeepSequence，且参数更少；结合AlphaFold结构后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有望替代MSAs，未来需进一步开发DMS数据集以优化变体效应预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据在流行病学研究和AI训练中的应用日益广泛，但其数据质量问题（如偏差、系统性错误）影响了研究结果的可靠性，现有评估方法不足以系统性评估数据适用性。

Method: 采用软件工程中的单元测试和覆盖率概念，开发了MDPT工具，包含自动测试生成器和数据测试框架，利用大语言模型生成测试用例并执行测试。

Result: 在三个数据集（AoU、MIMIC-III、SyntheticMass）上评估MDPT，生成了55-73个测试用例，成功识别了20-43个数据问题，并分析了测试套件的参考基础和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合外部医学知识，实现了上下文敏感的数据质量测试，为未来扩展（如多模态数据和改进的基础方法）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 传统强化学习后训练方法依赖模型初始能力生成正样本，难以解决模型初始失败的任务，尤其是在早期训练和复杂推理任务中。

Method: 提出Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)，通过结合当前策略和正确答案生成高质量样本，以引导模型探索新的推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，ExPO在推理基准测试中提高了学习效率和最终性能，尤其在MATH level-5等复杂任务中表现优于基于专家演示的方法。

Conclusion: ExPO通过生成更符合策略的高质量样本，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于信息增益的探索提供了理论保证，并通过PTS-BE框架实现了高效的深度探索。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: DAID通过因果分析成功平衡公平性与泛化性，验证了其理论和实践有效性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Result: 模型能生成符合自然抗体和已批准治疗抗体特征的序列，SVDD显著提升了可开发性评分。

Conclusion: 该框架为同时满足结合和生物物理标准的抗体设计提供了迭代的机器学习驱动方法。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Hanh Huyen My Nguyen,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于差分隐私生成模型的数据共享方法，通过联合训练差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE），解决了医学影像中数据稀缺和隐私问题，同时支持多样化下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中深度学习受限于数据稀缺和隐私法规，联邦学习存在通信成本高和任务单一的问题。

Method: 采用基础模型提取紧凑嵌入，联合训练DP-CVAE以建模全局隐私感知数据分布。

Result: 方法在隐私、可扩展性和效率上优于传统联邦学习，且DP-CVAE比DP-CGAN生成更高保真度的嵌入，参数减少5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像中的隐私保护和多任务学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多智能体强化学习（MARL）如何改进供应链中的动态定价策略，填补了传统ERP系统静态规则的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERP系统依赖静态规则，忽略了市场参与者间的战略互动，而单智能体强化学习无法模拟真实供应链的相互依赖性。

Method: 评估了三种MARL算法（MADDPG、MADQN、QMIX）与静态规则基线的性能，模拟环境基于真实电商数据和LightGBM需求预测模型。

Result: 静态规则代理公平性高但缺乏竞争动态；MADQN定价最激进，公平性最低；MADDPG平衡了市场竞争与公平性。

Conclusion: MARL能捕捉静态规则无法模拟的战略行为，为动态定价的未来发展提供参考。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于共识的联邦学习协议（FedVRD），通过动态限制对抗节点的影响并优化数据传输成本，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习中所有客户端均需传输权重，导致资源浪费。本文旨在减少无效数据传输并提升模型性能。

Method: 提出新的流体民主协议（viscous-retained democracy）和算法FedVRD，动态限制对抗节点影响并优化拓扑结构。

Result: FedVRD在相同假设下优于传统1p1v协议，且能防止影响力累积和对抗攻击。

Conclusion: FedVRD是一种高效且安全的联邦学习协议，适用于动态和对抗性环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法存在早期经验过拟合问题，受人类婴儿遗忘现象启发，提出新算法。

Method: 引入经验回放衰减（ER Decay）和网络扩展机制，分别实现遗忘早期经验和动态增加网络参数。

Result: 在40多个连续控制任务中，FoG算法表现优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FoG通过模仿人类遗忘与生长机制，显著提升了深度强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Motivation: 无桩电动滑板车作为环保灵活的交通工具，需求预测对其管理和规划至关重要。现有研究仅关注单一因素，未能全面捕捉需求模式。

Method: 开发了一个整合空间、时间和网络依赖性的框架，用于需求预测。

Result: 该框架将需求预测准确性提高了27%至49%，优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果为数据驱动的微移动管理提供了支持，有助于优化车队分布和可持续城市规划。

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Motivation: 解决蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPI）预测中数据异质性和跨物种数据稀疏的问题，提升预测性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出HIPPO框架，结合层次对比学习，通过多层次的生物表示匹配和数据驱动的惩罚机制，学习蛋白质序列和功能类别的层次关系。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最先进性能，尤其在低数据量和零样本迁移任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: HIPPO为跨物种PPI预测提供了统一框架，适用于数据稀疏或分布不均的场景，并揭示了层次特征融合对捕获保守相互作用决定因素的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在处理线性和非线性分类任务时高效且灵活。

Conclusion: 该方法为分类问题提供了鲁棒的替代方案，优于传统优化技术。

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了2-单纯形Transformer架构，通过改进注意力机制提高token效率，在数学、编程等任务中表现优于标准Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型依赖海量数据，但现有扩展定律假设数据无限且计算受限，实际中这一假设逐渐失效，因此需要更高效的架构。

Method: 提出2-单纯形Transformer，将标准点积注意力推广为三线性函数，并通过高效Triton内核实现。

Result: 在固定token预算下，2-单纯形Transformer在数学、编程等任务中表现优于标准Transformer，并改变了知识推理任务的扩展定律指数。

Conclusion: 2-单纯形Transformer通过改进注意力机制显著提升了token效率，为计算非受限场景下的模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Motivation: 解决在存在偏差离线数据的情况下，如何优化在线定价策略，并量化其对统计复杂性和遗憾界限的影响。

Method: 采用Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU)策略，结合离线数据的偏差、时间长度、数据规模和分散度，提出了一种广义OFU算法。

Result: 对于标量价格弹性，得到了最小最大最优的遗憾界限；对于一般价格弹性，提出了最坏情况下的最优遗憾率。

Conclusion: 论文首次在存在偏差离线数据的情况下，为上下文定价提供了严格的遗憾保证，并推广到带有偏差离线数据的随机线性bandit问题。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环模型（如状态空间模型和线性注意力）因其线性复杂度而流行，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能下降，无法泛化到更长序列。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析支持未探索状态假说，并提出训练干预方法（如高斯噪声初始化或使用其他序列的最终状态）。

Result: 仅用500步后训练（约0.1%预训练预算），模型能泛化到比训练上下文长多个数量级的序列（如2k→128k）。

Conclusion: 简单训练干预能高效提升循环模型的长度泛化能力，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Motivation: 现有生存分析模型通常仅在校准总体水平上表现良好，可能导致对少数子群体的预测不准确，从而影响临床决策。

Method: GRADUATE将多校准问题转化为约束优化问题，同时在训练中优化校准和区分度，确保平衡。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，GRADUATE在真实临床数据集上优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: GRADUATE通过多校准显著提升了生存分析的预测准确性，尤其在少数子群体中表现突出。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Conclusion: 新框架能有效减少因数据不一致导致的治疗效应估计偏差。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Conclusion: MvHo-IB通过有效利用HOIs，显著提升了诊断性能，为fMRI数据分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

Conclusion: 博弈论指导与实时反馈的结合显著提升了LLM在多智能体系统中的表现，增强了系统的灵活性和韧性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities across
mathematical, strategic, and linguistic tasks, yet little is known about how
well they reason in dynamic, real-time, multi-agent scenarios, such as
collaborative environments in which agents continuously adapt to each other's
behavior, as in cooperative gameplay settings. In this paper, we bridge this
gap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time
adaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic
principles such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed
framework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate,
communicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing
conditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback
mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate
contextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM
capabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our
method achieves up to a 26\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in
high-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05
milliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion

*Yubeen Lee,Sangeun Lee,Chaewon Park,Junyeop Cha,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: TAGF是一种时间感知门控融合框架，用于解决多模态情感识别中因噪声和模态不对齐导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别在效价-唤醒度估计中常因噪声和音频-视觉模态不对齐而性能下降，需要一种能自适应融合跨模态特征的方法。

Method: TAGF通过BiLSTM时间门控机制动态调节递归注意力输出的贡献，并结合多步跨模态特征。

Result: 在Aff-Wild2数据集上，TAGF表现优于现有递归注意力模型，且对模态不对齐具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TAGF能有效捕捉情感表达的时序演化和模态间复杂交互，适用于真实场景下的动态情感建模。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition often suffers from performance degradation in
valence-arousal estimation due to noise and misalignment between audio and
visual modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce TAGF, a Time-aware
Gated Fusion framework for multimodal emotion recognition. The TAGF adaptively
modulates the contribution of recursive attention outputs based on temporal
dynamics. Specifically, the TAGF incorporates a BiLSTM-based temporal gating
mechanism to learn the relative importance of each recursive step and
effectively integrates multistep cross-modal features. By embedding temporal
awareness into the recursive fusion process, the TAGF effectively captures the
sequential evolution of emotional expressions and the complex interplay between
modalities. Experimental results on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrate that TAGF
achieves competitive performance compared with existing recursive
attention-based models. Furthermore, TAGF exhibits strong robustness to
cross-modal misalignment and reliably models dynamic emotional transitions in
real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: VRAgent-R1是一种基于代理的新型视频推荐方法，通过两个代理（IP代理和US代理）模拟用户行为和视频内容理解，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推荐系统在用户模拟和多模态内容理解方面表现不佳，限制了推荐效果。

Method: VRAgent-R1包含IP代理（基于MLLMs模拟人类渐进思维）和US代理（通过CoT推理和强化学习优化推荐）。

Result: IP代理在NDCG@10上提升6.0%，US代理在用户决策模拟中准确率提高45.0%。

Conclusion: VRAgent-R1通过结合人类智能和多模态理解，显著提升了视频推荐的性能。

Abstract: Owing to powerful natural language processing and generative capabilities,
large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution for
enhancing recommendation systems via user simulation. However, in the realm of
video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based
simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of
multimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item
modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining
recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce
VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like
intelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two
distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US)
Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent
emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing
hidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal
content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system
is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US
Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences
through reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video
recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed
VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10
on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\%
higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: 机器人执行复杂任务时，用户可能因行为偏离预期而困惑，需要解释以理解其意图。

Method: 调查用户对解释需求和内容的偏好，提出两种算法识别意外行为并构建解释。

Result: 用户希望在意外情况下获得简洁解释，明确意图和相关上下文因素。

Conclusion: 提出的算法可集成到BDI推理中，改善人机交互。

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督学习的轨迹规划方法，通过循环架构生成轨迹模型，避免了传统采样规划的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样规划方法计算量大，而完全监督方法仅模仿轨迹，无法确保目标达成。因此，提出自监督学习方案以改进。

Method: 采用循环架构的自监督学习方案，利用正向和逆向运动学模型生成轨迹。

Result: 模型能在仅给定运动学模型的情况下学习生成轨迹，适用于复杂任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要自适应解决方案的复杂操作任务提供了新的规划途径。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于复杂机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

Method: 利用不变扩展卡尔曼滤波器（InEKF）融合GPS全局位置更新，并引入基于GPS地面航向信息的新航向校正机制。

Result: 在BlueBoat上验证了算法的有效性，实现了在GPS信号弱或挑战性环境下的精确航向观测与定位。

Conclusion: 提供了一种开源解决方案，为未来实验和比较研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and
heading estimation. Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine
autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other
mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm,
we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant
extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS
directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized
Blue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic
approach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free
localization and reliable orientation estimation. This work provides an open
source solution for accurate yaw observation and localization in challenging or
GPS-degraded conditions, and lays the groundwork for future experimental and
comparative studies.

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers.
Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to
physical vehicles. However, conventional ViL tests rely on full-size vehicles,
requiring large space and high expenses. Also, physical-model-based DT suffers
from the reality gap caused by modeling imprecision. This paper develops a
comprehensive and practical simulator for testing automated driving controllers
enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars
allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving
controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the
simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for
autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度去噪自编码器（DDAE）的高效路径规划方法SkelUnet，用于快速生成骨架化导航地图，平衡路径长度、安全性和响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨架化算法资源消耗大，且主要面向图像处理任务，难以满足路径规划中对快速、安全路径的需求。

Method: 利用基于U-Net架构的DDAE生成骨架化地图SkelUnet，通过一次性采样（OSS）探索整个工作空间。

Result: 在无人机模拟环境中测试，SkelUnet能连接自由工作空间所有区域，提供更安全的路径并减少处理时间。

Conclusion: SkelUnet方法适用于结构化环境中的移动服务机器人，显著提升了路径规划的效率和安全性。

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

Conclusion: 该框架为高效、可扩展的多智能体融合设定了新标准，有效应对实际协作感知挑战。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

Motivation: 现有共享控制方法在可行性、可扩展性和安全性方面存在不足，尤其是用户输入的不可预测性。

Method: 提出基于约束最优控制问题的框架，结合离线计算的控制不变集，支持在线控制动作计算，并能处理非凸约束。

Result: 通过大规模用户研究验证，框架在任务负载、信任、感知控制和性能方面均表现优越，且不牺牲安全性和用户意图。

Conclusion: 该框架为共享控制提供了一种可行、安全且用户友好的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

Abstract: Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of

robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Abstract: Under-actuated compliant robotic systems offer a promising approach to

embodied dynamic behaviors. This paper presents Flix-Walker, a novel,
untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as

distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype

performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,
scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.
Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments
demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint
estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of
articulated objects. Additional images and videos are available on the project

Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is
crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

Conclusion: 生成模型能有效模拟难建模的感官模态，并缩小多模态模拟到现实的差距。

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Conclusion: U3D指标弥补了ASV嵌入的不足，为评估声音克隆系统中的身份一致性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

Conclusion: Fx-Encoder++解决了乐器级音频效果理解的不足，为智能音乐制作提供了新工具。

Abstract: General-purpose audio representations have proven effective across diverse
music information retrieval applications, yet their utility in intelligent
music production remains limited by insufficient understanding of audio effects
(Fx). Although previous approaches have emphasized audio effects analysis at
the mixture level, this focus falls short for tasks demanding instrument-wise
audio effects understanding, such as automatic mixing. In this work, we present
Fx-Encoder++, a novel model designed to extract instrument-wise audio effects
representations from music mixtures. Our approach leverages a contrastive
learning framework and introduces an "extractor" mechanism that, when provided
with instrument queries (audio or text), transforms mixture-level audio effects
embeddings into instrument-wise audio effects embeddings. We evaluated our
model across retrieval and audio effects parameter matching tasks, testing its
performance across a diverse range of instruments. The results demonstrate that
Fx-Encoder++ outperforms previous approaches at mixture level and show a novel
ability to extract effects representation instrument-wise, addressing a
critical capability gap in intelligent music production systems.

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的解决方案以应对VC带来的安全和隐私风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Conclusion: ASDA有效提升了音频任务的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

Conclusion: 该方法减少了对大规模人工标注数据的依赖，提高了对未见法律文本的适用性，为法律合规性提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

*Chung-ju Huang,Ziqi Zhang,Yinggui Wang,Binghui Wang,Tao Wei,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VeFIA框架为垂直联邦学习中的推理软件执行正确性提供审计机制，确保隐私和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VFL缺乏对数据方推理软件执行正确性的审计机制。

Method: 设计VeFIA框架，利用TEE和协调器验证数据方计算结果的正确性。

Result: 异常推理超过5.4%时，任务方可99.99%概率检测异常，且无额外延迟。

Conclusion: VeFIA首次解决VFL中推理软件执行正确性问题，高效且隐私保护。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RLHGNN是一种新颖的框架，通过将事件日志转换为异构图并结合强化学习，优化了服务架构中的下一活动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列和基于图的方法无法完全捕捉并行执行和条件依赖的非顺序关系，且静态结构无法适应不同流程复杂性。

Method: RLHGNN将事件日志转换为具有三种边类型的异构图，通过强化学习选择最优图结构，并使用异构图卷积预测下一活动。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，RLHGNN表现优于现有方法，且推理延迟仅为1毫秒。

Conclusion: RLHGNN是一种高效且实用的解决方案，适用于实时业务过程监控。

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The
source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过更精细的专利分类，识别真正的绿色专利，并验证其对企业的经济影响，为政策制定提供依据。

Method: 使用神经网络扩展基线词典，通过向量表示与环境技术相关的表达，并测试专利与企业财务数据的关系。

Result: “真正”绿色专利占20%，持有此类专利的企业在销售、市场份额和生产率方面表现更好，高新颖性专利还带来更高利润。

Conclusion: 文本分析有助于更精细的专利分类，对政策制定具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Method: 采用基于中位数绝对偏差的阈值策略，分析自适应ISTA的固定点性质、收敛性等。

Result: 证明了算法的尺度等变性、非唯一性、局部稳定性，以及局部线性收敛和全局收敛。

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

Conclusion: 理论分析和数值实验验证了方法的有效性，特别是在计算金融的随机模拟问题中表现优异。

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the
validity of our methodology.

Conclusion: 处理噪声的分布对因果推断效果估计有重要影响，新提出的高阶稳健估计方法在非高斯噪声条件下具有优势。

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Motivation: 稀疏变分高斯过程是扩展GP模型的标准方法，但现有对角缩放矩阵的近似方法仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过引入块对角结构，进一步提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种块对角缩放矩阵的扩展方法，并将其与Power Expectation Propagation（PEP）框架结合，形成新的结构化近似后验。

Result: 实验证明，块对角近似方法在回归任务中性能优于或与现有对角近似方法相当，且计算成本相近。PEP框架结合结构化后验在不同超参数设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: 块对角近似方法为稀疏变分高斯过程提供了更灵活的改进方案，PEP框架的引入进一步扩展了其适用性。

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘网络中稀疏的推理请求导致现有流水线方法利用率低，FlowSpec通过优化推测解码机制来解决这一问题。

Method: FlowSpec结合了三种关键技术：基于分数的逐步验证、高效的草稿管理和动态草稿扩展策略。

Conclusion: FlowSpec通过提高流水线利用率和推测效率，为边缘网络中的LLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: LiTEN框架为复杂生物分子建模提供了物理基础的高效解决方案，适用于药物发现及相关应用。

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

Motivation: 当前移动设备上的LLM框架在CPU、GPU和内存三个高能耗组件上运行，且各组件调控器独立工作，导致能源效率低下。

Method: 通过测量现有LLM框架的能源效率，分析各调控器之间的交互问题，并设计FUSE调控器以优化性能。

Result: FUSE显著降低了首次令牌生成时间和每个输出令牌的延迟，同时保持相同的能源消耗。

Conclusion: FUSE有效提升了移动设备上LLM推理的能源效率，为实际应用提供了优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

Conclusion: 该框架在高雷诺数湍流模拟中表现出色，填补了传统方法的空白。

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

high-throughput screening, addressing challenges such as fragmented toolchains

### [252] [Early Signs of Steganographic Capabilities in Frontier LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02737)
*Artur Zolkowski,Kei Nishimura-Gasparian,Robert McCarthy,Roland S. Zimmermann,David Lindner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大型语言模型（LLM）具备初步的隐写能力，但尚不足以绕过设计良好的监控系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿LLM的隐写能力，以了解其潜在风险。

Method: 研究两种隐写方式：传递编码信息和执行编码推理，测试模型在标准和非标准条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在标准条件下无法隐藏短信息，但在额外条件下（如使用未监控的草稿）可能成功；初步显示模型能进行基本编码推理。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的隐写能力尚不成熟，但未来可能发展出更强的规避监控能力。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

*Lu Yan,Zhuo Zhang,Xiangzhe Xu,Shengwei An,Guangyu Shen,Zhou Xuan,Xuan Chen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MGC的框架，通过模块化分解和规避对齐机制生成恶意软件，揭示了组合攻击对齐AI系统的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）降低了软件开发的门槛，但也可能被用于恶意软件开发。现有对齐机制仅评估单个提示，忽视了恶意操作可分解为看似良性的子任务。

Method: 引入Malware Generation Compiler（MGC）框架，使用Malware Description Intermediate Representation（MDIR）将恶意意图转化为良性代码片段。

Result: MGC在三个基准数据集上生成功能恶意软件的正确率比越狱方法高365.79%，比地下服务高78.07%，并能复现和增强16个真实恶意软件样本。

Conclusion: MGC揭示了组合攻击对齐AI系统的风险，为安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

### [254] [Can Artificial Intelligence solve the blockchain oracle problem? Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02125)
*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI如何作为补充层解决区块链预言机问题，但无法完全消除对链下数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链预言机问题限制了去中心化应用的发展，现有方法未能完全解决链下数据可靠注入的挑战。

Method: 通过分析学术文献和实践案例，评估AI技术（如异常检测、语言事实提取等）在增强预言机系统中的作用。

Result: AI能提升数据质量、来源选择和系统韧性，但仍需依赖不可验证的链下输入。

Conclusion: AI应被视为预言机设计中的补充层，而非信任假设的替代品。

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DRAM物理随机性的新型TRNG（EIM-TRNG），用于保护DNN模型权重数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件安全中TRNG的重要性，以及DNN模型参数保护的需求。

Method: 利用DRAM的RowHammer扰动产生的随机比特翻转作为熵源，结合固定和随机翻转编码数据。

Result: 验证了DRAM熵提取的有效性，为低成本硬件安全提供了新方向。

Conclusion: EIM-TRNG为机器学习模型的硬件级保护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日志分析在网络安全中至关重要，能够为网络和系统威胁检测提供信息。研究旨在利用LLMs提升异常检测和缓解建议的效果。

Method: 比较了三种开源LLMs在零样本、少样本提示和微调三种策略下的表现，并利用MITRE CAPEC映射威胁和定义物联网特定缓解措施。

Result: LLMs在多类攻击分类中优于传统机器学习基线模型，并能结合检测和缓解建议。

Conclusion: 微调LLMs在物联网安全日志分析中具有潜力，能够提供更高效的威胁检测和缓解建议。

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CyberRAG是一个基于代理的模块化RAG框架，用于实时分类、解释和结构化报告网络攻击，显著降低误报率并提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统IDS/IPS系统因高误报率和无关上下文检索而导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 采用模块化设计，结合微调的专业分类器、工具适配器和迭代检索-推理循环，动态优化威胁标签和解释。

Result: 分类准确率达94.92%，生成解释的BERTScore为0.94，专家评分为4.9/5。

Conclusion: CyberRAG通过代理化设计实现了高检测准确性和可扩展性，为半自主网络防御提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

Motivation: 开源模型对AI安全社区至关重要，通过开放研究共同开发攻击和防御方法，推动科学进步。

Method: 利用改进版的SOTA SecAlign防御方法进行训练，并提供完整的训练细节。

Result: 在9个实用基准和7个安全基准上表现优异，Meta-SecAlign-70B在未见过的下游任务中展现出安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: Meta SecAlign在抵御提示注入攻击方面达到最先进的鲁棒性，且实用性接近闭源商业LLM。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

Motivation: 随着联网车辆的数字化发展，网络安全风险增加，需要自适应检测机制来应对未知和复杂的威胁，但实际测试车辆上生成攻击数据的限制导致数据稀缺。

Method: 开发了一种上下文感知的攻击数据生成器，利用参数化攻击模型和CAN消息解码技术，生成多种攻击类型的数据，并评估其在入侵检测系统中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该数据生成方法有效解决了攻击数据稀缺问题，并验证了生成数据的质量和实用性。

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的不公平现象（如性别、种族、年龄或流行度偏见）在动态交互环境中会加剧，导致马太效应、过滤气泡等问题。

Method: HyFairCRS通过对比学习构建多样化的超图来捕捉用户兴趣，并在对话中利用这些兴趣生成公平的推荐。

Result: 在两个CRS数据集上的实验表明，HyFairCRS在性能上达到新高度，同时有效缓解了不公平问题。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS为动态对话推荐系统中的公平性问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统在固定曲率和刚性嵌入下的局限性，实现更灵活的语义探索和不确定性建模。

Method: 使用自适应曲率概率球表示用户、项目和标签，结合曲率感知语义核进行多跳推理。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，NDCG、校准和多样性表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ManifoldMind提供透明、可信的推荐，适用于稀疏或抽象领域。

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

Conclusion: LLM标注引入结构化变异性，建议在政策相关检索任务中将分类分歧作为分析对象。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

Conclusion: 论文提出了解决内容过滤方法间冲突的潜在途径，为音乐推荐系统的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上显著优于10个基线方法，性能提升达50%，GPU内存减少17.9%。

Conclusion: LPO4Rec高效且有效，特别适合尾部物品推荐。

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is

Conclusion: AC-Refiner通过条件扩散模型有效优化算术电路设计，显著提升了设计质量和优化效率。

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our

### [267] [Subtyping in DHOL -- Extended preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02855)
*Colin Rothgang,Florian Rabe*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: DHOL（依赖类型高阶逻辑）通过牺牲类型系统的可判定性来增强表达能力，同时保留自动化定理证明支持。本文扩展了DHOL，添加了精化和商类型，通过子类型化实现，并证明了其语法、语义及翻译的完备性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DHOL在表达能力和自动化支持之间提供了平衡，但缺乏实践中常用的精化和商类型。这些类型通常难以在可判定的类型系统中实现。

Method: 将精化和商类型作为子类型的特例引入DHOL，通过身份映射避免表示上的开销。

Result: 扩展后的DHOL支持精化和商类型，语法、语义及翻译的完备性和可靠性得到证明。

Conclusion: 通过子类型化优雅地扩展了DHOL，为实践提供了更多灵活性，同时保持了自动化支持。

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

### [268] [Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005)
*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 结合AutoML与XAI预测焊接横向加劲肋细节的疲劳强度，通过专家驱动与算法特征工程提升准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决焊接钢结构疲劳强度预测的准确性和可解释性问题，结合专家知识与自动化方法。

Method: 使用AutoML训练梯度提升、随机森林和神经网络，比较三种特征方案（领域知识、算法生成、组合），并应用XAI方法（SHAP和特征重要性）分析。

Result: 模型M2在测试集上表现最佳（RMSE≈30.6 MPa，R²≈0.780），XAI揭示了应力比、应力范围等为主要预测因素。

Conclusion: AutoML与XAI结合可生成准确、可解释的疲劳强度模型，未来将探索概率建模与数字孪生集成。

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

TL;DR: DeepSupp是一种基于多头注意力机制的深度学习模型，用于检测金融市场中的支撑位，通过动态相关性矩阵和无监督聚类提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统支撑位识别方法难以适应现代市场的复杂性，现有研究多关注价格预测而非结构识别。

Method: 采用多头注意力机制分析空间相关性，结合动态相关性矩阵和注意力自编码器进行表示学习，最后用DBSCAN聚类提取支撑位。

Result: 在S&P 500股票上表现优于六种基线方法，在六项金融指标上达到最优。

Conclusion: DeepSupp填补了支撑位检测的空白，展示了注意力架构在揭示市场模式和优化交易策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果一致证明了所提任务和模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文通过NGAT和长期股票预测任务解决了现有方法的局限性，并公开了项目以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: LSTM模型在金融时间序列预测中有效，未来可探索混合模型。

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

Conclusion: 新闻标题数据是预测股票价格的重要特征，结合金融数据可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

TL;DR: SAGE-FIN是一种基于半监督图神经网络的金融欺诈检测方法，通过Granger因果解释解决数据稀疏性和模型不可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融欺诈每年造成巨大损失，但传统机器学习方法因数据稀疏和缺乏解释性而难以应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-FIN，利用半监督图神经网络处理弱标记数据，并通过Granger因果性提供解释。

Result: 在真实数据集Elliptic++上验证了SAGE-FIN的性能，成功识别欺诈项目并提供解释。

Conclusion: SAGE-FIN有效解决了金融欺诈检测中的两大挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control
(MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded
disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

Method: 采用ADASYN和NEARMISS混合数据平衡策略训练XGBoost模型，结合SHAP和CART进行解释性分析。

Result: 模型预测准确率达91.39%（流入）和91.53%（流出），关键影响因素包括移动渠道交易、互动和信用卡使用。

Conclusion: 移动参与和信用卡使用是客户数据共享行为的主要驱动因素，为金融机构提供了战略洞察。

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve
the flexibility, robustness, and realism of financial stress testing.

<details>

Motivation: 心肌梗死（MI）是全球主要死因之一，现有LGE和T2加权CMR成像虽能识别瘢痕和水肿，但耗时且需对比剂。cine CMR快速无对比剂，可捕捉心肌运动与结构异常。

Method: 设计CineMyoPS网络，提取MI相关运动和解剖特征，利用一致性损失联合学习，并通过时间序列聚合策略整合心脏周期内的特征。

Result: 在多中心数据集上验证，CineMyoPS在心肌病理分割、运动估计和解剖分割中表现优异。

Conclusion: CineMyoPS为无对比剂的心肌病理分割提供了高效解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动脉采血在小动物研究中复杂且耗时，限制了纵向研究，因此需要一种非侵入性替代方法。

Method: FC-DLIF模型通过空间和时间特征提取器从PET序列中预测动脉输入函数，并在[$^{18}$F]FDG数据上训练和评估。

Result: 模型能可靠预测输入函数，对时间截断和偏移具有鲁棒性，但对未在训练数据中的其他示踪剂预测失败。

Conclusion: FC-DLIF为非侵入性输入函数预测提供了可靠且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

*Zhurong Chen,Jinhua Chen,Wei Zhuo,Wufeng Xue,Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从2D超声切片重建个性化3D心脏解剖的创新框架，显著提高了左心室和右心室体积估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的2D超声成像在心脏疾病临床实践中存在解释困难和参数估计不准确的问题，而3D超声成像又受限于分辨率和手动标注的高要求。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的3D重建流程，通过交替优化2D切片的3D姿态估计和基于隐式神经网络的3D切片整合，逐步将先验3D心脏形状转化为个性化模型。

Result: 使用六个平面时，重建的3D心脏显著改善了左心室体积估计（误差1.98% vs. 20.24%），并首次实现了从2D切片估计右心室体积（误差5.75%）。

Conclusion: 该方法为心脏超声的个性化3D结构和功能分析提供了新途径，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: MEGANet-W提出了一种基于小波的边缘引导注意力网络，用于结直肠息肉分割，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠息肉分割对早期癌症检测至关重要，但现有方法在弱边界和低对比度条件下表现不佳。

Method: MEGANet-W结合了无参数的Haar小波边缘图和注意力模块，通过多方向边缘提取和特征融合提升性能。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上，MEGANet-W的mIoU和mDice分别提升了2.3%和1.2%。

Conclusion: MEGANet-W无需额外可学习参数，显著提升了分割精度，适用于复杂成像条件。

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

TL;DR: MetaFO是一种基于贝叶斯变换器的基础模型，用于解决AI驱动材料设计中的任务特定重训练、泛化能力差等问题，实现了零样本预测和非线性逆向设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的材料设计方法存在任务特定重训练、泛化能力差等问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出MetaFO，一种受大语言模型启发的贝叶斯变换器基础模型，学习超材料的底层力学，实现零样本预测和逆向设计。

Result: MetaFO在未见过的材料属性组合和结构响应中表现出色，显著扩展了设计空间。

Conclusion: MetaFO为AI驱动的超材料发现提供了可扩展和通用的框架，标志着范式转变。

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态LLM的合成启发式评估方法，用于用户体验设计，其性能在部分方面优于人类评估者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用户体验评估成本高，需专家时间和用户补偿，因此探索低成本、高效的替代方法。

Method: 利用多模态LLM分析图像并提供设计反馈，进行合成启发式评估，并与人类评估者对比。

Result: 合成评估识别了73%和77%的可用性问题，优于人类评估者（57%和63%），尤其在布局问题上表现突出，但在识别UI组件和设计惯例方面较弱。

Conclusion: 合成评估在特定任务上表现稳定且高效，但需改进对UI组件和跨屏幕问题的识别能力。

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成情感丰富对话时的表现，发现情感建模需结合自动化和人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对话代理在日常互动中的普及，情感智能（尤其是共情倾听）的需求日益增长。

Method: 使用ChatGPT和Gemini扩展由专家设计的小数据集，通过VADER情感分析和专家评估分析对话情感进展。

Result: 生成对话虽能反映情感结构，但人工评估显示共情和连贯性存在差异。

Conclusion: 情感对话建模需结构对齐和深度结合，强调自动化与人工方法结合的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

TL;DR: 研究探讨数据科学家如何将模糊概念转化为具体的代理目标变量，揭示了其通过拼凑过程满足五个主要标准，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊概念（如“学生写作的真实性”或“患者的医疗需求”）在预测建模中难以明确定义，但数据科学家如何将其转化为具体目标变量的过程尚不明确。

Method: 访谈了15位数据科学家（教育领域8人，医疗领域7人），分析其构建目标变量的过程。

Result: 数据科学家通过拼凑过程满足五个标准（有效性、简单性、可预测性、可移植性和资源需求），并采用问题重构策略。

Conclusion: 研究为HCI、CSCW和ML领域提供了未来研究方向，以更好地支持目标变量构建的科学与艺术。

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图生成方法依赖预定义的结构属性，而现有深度学习模型受限于节点ID，无法生成更大规模的图或考虑节点属性。

Method: 提出LGSG框架，结合扩散模型和节点嵌入，无需重新训练即可生成不同规模的图。

Result: LGSG在标准指标上与基线模型相当，在节点聚类倾向等被忽视的指标上表现更优，且在不同规模图中保持结构一致性。

Conclusion: LGSG展示了鲁棒性和可扩展性，为图生成领域提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域对AI披露的需求增加，现有方法在细粒度、可解释性和稳健性上不足。

Method: 开发FinAI-BERT模型，基于手动标注的1,586个句子数据集进行微调。

Result: 模型性能优异（准确率99.37%，F1分数0.993），并通过SHAP分析确保可解释性。

Conclusion: FinAI-BERT为金融NLP提供了细粒度分类工具，适用于分析师、监管者和学者。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动分析耗时、主观以及传统工具（如ImageJ）速度慢、不准确的问题。

Method: 使用tubuleTracker、ImageJ和手动方法分析54张内皮细胞图像，比较分析时间和关键指标。

Result: tubuleTracker分析速度最快（6秒/图），且其指标（如血管圆度）能有效反映血管生成成熟度。

Conclusion: tubuleTracker是高效、一致的工具，适用于生物医学研究。

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

Conclusion: PrEDS为复杂网络系统的分析和设计提供了理论基础，特别适用于自组织系统的研究。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems
using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By
representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with
incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that
decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles
of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems
governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this
approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical
Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional
space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When
systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be
effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We
demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including
resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds),
elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct
correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into
optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical
foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems
that self-organize through local interactions.

Result: 仿真显示DNN在测试阶段能保持次优频谱效率，适应距离变化。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中具有潜力，能显著提升效率并降低计算负担。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中RAN的能耗占比超过50%，现有技术未能充分利用数据潜力，亟需降低运营成本。

Method: 1. 使用CCL框架进行高精度网络流量和用户预测；2. 提出DUPS方案，利用深度强化学习和CCL预测动态优化DU服务器资源。

Result: CCL在预测性能上优于现有方法43.9%~31.35%；DUPS将能效提升89%，显著降低运营成本。

Conclusion: 结合CCL和DUPS的方法为5G RAN的能效和成本效益提供了突破性解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advancements, Radio Access Networks (RAN) still account for over 50\%
of the total power consumption in 5G networks. Existing RAN split options do
not fully harness data potential, presenting an opportunity to reduce
operational expenditures. This paper addresses this opportunity through a
twofold approach. First, highly accurate network traffic and user predictions
are achieved using the proposed Curated Collaborative Learning (CCL) framework,
which selectively collaborates with relevant correlated data for traffic
forecasting. CCL optimally determines whom, when, and what to collaborate with,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, including global,
federated, personalized federated, and cyclic institutional incremental
learnings by 43.9%, 39.1%, 40.8%, and 31.35%, respectively. Second, the
Distributed Unit Pooling Scheme (DUPS) is proposed, leveraging deep
reinforcement learning and prediction inferences from CCL to reduce the number
of active DU servers efficiently. DUPS dynamically redirects traffic from
underutilized DU servers to optimize resource use, improving energy efficiency
by up to 89% over conventional strategies, translating into substantial
monetary benefits for operators. By integrating CCL-driven predictions with
DUPS, this paper demonstrates a transformative approach for minimizing energy
consumption and operational costs in 5G RANs, significantly enhancing
efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Motivation: 研究神经量子态（NQS）在量子多体系统中的应用潜力，特别是针对高温超导的最小模型——二维Hubbard模型。

Method: 利用Transformer架构设计NQS，并开发高效优化算法，研究其在不同尺度上的关联编码能力。

Result: 在二维Hubbard模型中实现了最先进的结果，验证了半填充条纹基态的存在，与实验观测一致。

Conclusion: NQS是解决强关联多费米子系统的有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging
many-fermions systems.

Result: 在真实投资组合优化矩阵上的评估表明，该框架能显著加速收敛并减少计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的加速求解器支持动态投资组合分配和实时期权定价中更快的决策。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

Motivation: 探索算法配置与问题特征之间的相互作用，以增强算法的可解释性并指导配置选择。

Method: 计算六种modCMA变体在24个BBOB基准问题上的性能足迹，分析5维和30维设置下的表现。

Result: 揭示了算法配置与问题特征的共同和独特交互模式，展示了算法足迹在提升可解释性和配置选择中的有效性。

Conclusion: 算法足迹是分析算法性能和指导配置选择的有力工具。

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Conclusion: 新方法提供了对算法搜索动态的更深入理解。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DecoRTL的新型解码策略，用于改进大语言模型（LLM）在RTL代码生成中的表现，解决了传统解码策略在结构和语义上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM解码策略在RTL代码生成中常产生无效或重复的代码输出，无法满足结构和语义需求。

Method: DecoRTL结合了自一致性采样和语法感知温度调整，通过生成多候选并重新排序，以及根据语法角色调整采样温度。

Result: 在VerilogEval基准测试中，DecoRTL显著提升了语法有效性、功能正确性和输出多样性，且性能开销几乎不可察觉。

Conclusion: DecoRTL是一种无需额外微调的运行时解码策略，有效解决了LLM在RTL生成中的问题。

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

Motivation: 研究动物行为如何从神经活动中产生是神经科学的核心目标，但大规模、密集连接的哺乳动物大脑中的神经解码存在挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的LLMs（如DeepSeek Coder-7b）解码斑马鱼全脑钙成像和行为数据。

Result: 预训练的LLMs显著提高了神经解码准确性，并能预测长时间尺度的尾部运动。

Conclusion: LLMs为全脑神经环路解析提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种频率-时间循环神经网络（FTRNN），用于解决深度神经网络在语音分离中因训练与测试数据长度不匹配导致的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度神经网络在语音分离中因计算限制只能训练短片段，而实际应用需处理更长的多说话人录音，导致性能下降。

Method: FTRNN采用全频带模块建模频率依赖性和子频带模块建模时间模式，无需分段即可处理长音频。

Result: 模型在未训练的长音频（21-121秒）上表现鲁棒，保持说话人关联且无分段失真。

Conclusion: FTRNN是一种轻量级方法，能有效泛化到多说话人语音分离和说话人关联任务。

Abstract: Current deep neural network (DNN) based speech separation faces a fundamental
challenge -- while the models need to be trained on short segments due to
computational constraints, real-world applications typically require processing
significantly longer recordings with multiple utterances per speaker than seen
during training. In this paper, we investigate how existing approaches perform
in this challenging scenario and propose a frequency-temporal recurrent neural
network (FTRNN) that effectively bridges this gap. Our FTRNN employs a
full-band module to model frequency dependencies within each time frame and a
sub-band module that models temporal patterns in each frequency band. Despite
being trained on short fixed-length segments of 10 s, our model demonstrates
robust separation when processing signals significantly longer than training
segments (21-121 s) and preserves speaker association across utterance gaps
exceeding those seen during training. Unlike the conventional
segment-separation-stitch paradigm, our lightweight approach (0.9 M parameters)
performs inference on long audio without segmentation, eliminating segment
boundary distortions while simplifying deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate the generalization ability of FTRNN for multi-utterance speech
separation and speaker association.

Motivation: 解决现有LALM因音频指令调优导致的语言能力遗忘问题。

Method: 提出DeSTA策略，利用主干LLM自生成训练目标，构建大规模任务无关数据集DeSTA-AQA5M。

Result: 在多个音频语言基准测试中达到最优或竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 自生成数据策略优于传统方法，为构建通用LALM提供实用指导。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度非线性空间选择性滤波器在静态场景中表现优异，但在动态场景中需要高资源的数据驱动跟踪算法，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用。

Method: 采用低复杂度的粒子滤波作为跟踪算法，并引入时间反馈，利用增强的语音信号补偿粒子滤波的建模限制。

Result: 在合成数据集上，该方法显著提高了跟踪准确性和增强性能；真实录音的听力测试表明其优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自导向管道在动态场景中实现了高效的实时语音增强，是资源受限场景下的优选方案。

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于感知的HRTF个性化方法，通过优化潜在空间以匹配感知距离，从而提升听觉体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HRTF个性化方法在潜在空间学习中未考虑感知兼容性，可能导致生成或选择的HRTF与实际听觉体验不一致。

Method: 提出了一种感知驱动的潜在空间嵌入方法，结合基于度量的损失函数和MMDS监督，优化HRTF的个性化生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升HRTF的感知兼容性，改善个性化空间音频的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为HRTF个性化提供了更符合听觉感知的解决方案，有望提升用户的听觉体验。

Abstract: Personalized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are essential for
ensuring a realistic auditory experience over headphones, because they take
into account individual anatomical differences that affect listening. Most
machine learning approaches to HRTF personalization rely on a learned
low-dimensional latent space to generate or select custom HRTFs for a listener.
However, these latent representations are typically learned in a manner that
optimizes for spectral reconstruction but not for perceptual compatibility,
meaning they may not necessarily align with perceptual distance. In this work,
we first study whether traditionally learned HRTF representations are well
correlated with perceptual relations using auditory-based objective perceptual
metrics; we then propose a method for explicitly embedding HRTFs into a
perception-informed latent space, leveraging a metric-based loss function and
supervision via Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MMDS). Finally, we demonstrate
the applicability of these learned representations to the task of HRTF
personalization. We suggest that our method has the potential to render
personalized spatial audio, leading to an improved listening experience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性处理ASA任务导致响应时间长且对初始任务错误敏感，不适用于计算资源有限的应用场景。

Method: 采用多代理并行处理ASA任务，引入反馈循环（如分离质量修正定位误差，分类结果降低定位干扰敏感性）。

Result: 开发了多代理听觉场景分析（MASA）系统，具有低响应时间、低计算复杂度且对局部错误鲁棒。

Conclusion: MASA系统为ASA任务提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

Hanabi is\na cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained\ncommunication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it\nan ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI\ninteraction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this\nwork, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to\novercome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human\nevaluations. We develop \\textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human\ndataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation\npartners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we\nopen-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of\navailable human gameplay data.

This is\naccentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the\nstrong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address\nthis problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that\naccomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the\nfirst phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize\ncatching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated\nsmoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a\nreal-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the\nend-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the\nobject to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the\nrobot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on\nhuman demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with\nunknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used\nto enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a\nstack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a\nsecondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one\ndimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics\nproposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be\ninfeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The\naddition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching\nheight is increased to evaluate the method's robustness.

However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization\n(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate\neither individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with\na broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and\ndistribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct\nnovel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples\nto create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP\nare used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text\nversus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores\nthem to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and\nleverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For\nevaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20\ndifferent reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP\nscore, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare\ninstance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple\nFAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an\n81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets\nindeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards.

Our results reveal that\nsome static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more\nclosely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease\nin performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish\nrespectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages\nbetween Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between\nM-MMLU and CL-IFEval).

However, we argue that video depth\nestimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal\nconsistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are\nfundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically\nbackgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all\nframes, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for\ndynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to\nensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.\nBased on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth\nestimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with\nvideo depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic\nareas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth\ndiffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of\nboth.

However, localizing a drone\nrelative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several\nchallenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the\nnumber of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently\ndetected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from\nother objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an\nestimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a\nsingle geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than\ntracking individual conductors separately.

A sensitivity analysis\nshows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier\npoints as valid conductors measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7535\u529b\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316LiDAR\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u4e0e\u6574\u4e2a\u5bfc\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bfc\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u5e26\u7535\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u529b\u7ebf\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bfc\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u9762\u5c0f\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ca\u533a\u5206\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316LiDAR\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u4e0e\u5bfc\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u72ec\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6bcf\u6839\u5bfc\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6bcf\u5e27\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4e\u4e8e50\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u529b\u7ebf\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we develop a layered\ncomputational framework that derives operational principles from this\nfoundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as\ndirectional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that\nfavors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four\nhierarchical layers of operational principles: (\\textbf{L1}) \\emph{Core\nInference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric\ninference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,\nall shown to be mutually reducible; (\\textbf{L2}) \\emph{Resource Allocation\nPrinciples}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,\nand attractor-based memory encoding; (\\textbf{L3}) \\emph{Temporal Bootstrapping\nDynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;\nand (\\textbf{L4}) \\emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates\nthese mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and\nplanning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among\nprinciples, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of\nCCUP-aligned inference.

However, the\ndesign choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,\nare numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce\noptimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this\npaper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter\nconfigurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:\nHindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.\n  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in\ncapturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short\nmelodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range\ndependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze\ncomputational resource requirements across different adapter scales,\ndemonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal\nbalance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a\ndiffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to\nthe description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in\nnotes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive\nand requires significantly more time to train.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans.

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,\nnarratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for\npersonalized and engaging story animation.

In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a\nconditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural\nsinging voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage\nand often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized\naudio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated\nwith two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch\narchitecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference\nto guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware\nsynthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel\nlow-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch\ncontours and long term spectral dependencies.

On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace.

These\nlimitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world\nlanguage tasks.\n  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream\napplications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant\nknowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training\ntechnique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.

We define active inference AI systems for scientific\ndiscovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in\ncausal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic\nplanners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge\ngraphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes\ncausal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while\nstrengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations\nthrough closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and\nautomated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides\naction and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an\narchitecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models\nthat enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds\nhypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in\nfeedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes\nhuman judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent\narchitectural component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u586b\u8865\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e09\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8131\u79bb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6216\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4ee5\u53ca\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly\nsupport lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)\nformats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a\nshared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and\nperform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency\ngains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of\nblock-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one\nthousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from\n$2 \\times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \\times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad\nrange of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe\nthat training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the\nloss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we\nconduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that\nexhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural\nsettings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a\nsimple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the\nquantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of\nactivations can trigger runaway divergence.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

Automated accurate delineation of\ncardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and\nautomated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep\nlearning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution\ntransformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and\nspatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an\naccurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance\n(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships\nusing a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and\nspatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep\nembedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies\nimportant features and their spatial localization. The combined edge\ninformation with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces\ninformation-loss during convolution transformations.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way.

However,\nconventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to\nreproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed\nneural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC)\nwith FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics.\nCardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a\npre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized\nnetwork, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly\nestimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure\nmeasurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to\ntraditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling\nacross the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches\nimaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to\n0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior.

To\napproach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may\ntherefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to\nidentify \"fake text\" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5\nversion increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate\ndeceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of\nfake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model\narchitectures may improve their deceptiveness", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u201c\u5047\u6587\u672c\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5047\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u800c\u8d85\u8d8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u53e4\u5178\u4fa6\u63a2\u5c0f\u8bf4\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5047\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7248\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "Gemini\u57280.5\u7248\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u540e\u751f\u6210\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u800cGPT\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5047\u6587\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

Traditional methods, including gradient-based\nsolvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become\nimpractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,\nrequiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible\nparameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present\na multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously\ninfer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then\ncollaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints.

Through two phases - autonomous constraint\ngeneration using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent\noptimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational\nbounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and\nyield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance\nwith conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational\nefficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge.

Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse\ndirection-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better\nchatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,\nlittle research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.\nTo address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)\nframework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like\nidentity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human\nempathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and\nintentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial\nbehaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which\nchatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the\nreasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and\nintentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and\nemotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and\nintention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative\nanalysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial\nbehaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like.

Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on\nconjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \\geq t$ on a single input\nvariable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel\npolytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of\ninterpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the\ngradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of\nexpressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of\naxis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such\nfeatures, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and\ncomplexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the\nmodel. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical\npropositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,\ni.e., propositions of the form $\\mathbf{x}^\\mathrm{T}\\mathbf{w} \\geq t$, where\n$\\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as\ngeneral polytopes with oblique faces.

However, challenges arise when the information provided by these\nrobots contradicts users' memory, raising concerns about user trust and\ndecision-making. This paper presents a study that examines how varying a\nrobot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,\ndecision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information\nfrom a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants\nwatched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and\nsuggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that\nremembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced\nusers' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency\nrobot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly\nremembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were\nmore likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner\nor another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,\nparticipants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the\nrobot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system\nmalfunctions or third-party interference. These findings highlight the impact\nof transparency mechanisms in robotic systems, the complexity and importance\nassociated with system access control for multi-user robots deployed in home\nenvironments, and the potential risks of users' over reliance on robots in\nsensitive domains such as healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u6027\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u66f4\u6613\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u8eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u533b\u7597\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8bb0\u5fc6\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc72x2\u88ab\u8bd5\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c176\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u89c2\u770bFurhat\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bb6\u5ead\u5065\u5eb7\u52a9\u624b\u5efa\u8bae\u670d\u836f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u66f4\u6613\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fe1\u4efb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6000\u7591\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u6216\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7528\u6237\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

This work proposes a novel approach to\nenhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These\nagents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying\nand potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements\nbefore GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for\nrealistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks\nincluding a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate\nthat integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of\nGNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a\ncomplementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u5728\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "GNN\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NIDS\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6790\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u53ef\u7591\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u518d\u4ea4\u7531GNN\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u5206\u6790\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86GNN\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\u8865\u5145\u5c42\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u5728NIDS\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the\nfailure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due\nto the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated\nby training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE\nlearns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of\nfeature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across\ndifferent checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nmodification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK\nactivation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states\nequivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple\narchitectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while\nproviding robust interpretability benefits.

However, 2D\nspecimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative\nspecimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of\npatients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with\nForward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging\nboth local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR\nimages. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,\nnon-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18\nbackbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary\nmasks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach\nachieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with\na 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing\ninference time to 47 milliseconds per image.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning\nand activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per\ninput. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain\nforgetting/generalization during fine-tuning.

Yet, a score fails to\ndescribe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.\nBenefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models\n(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.\nThe core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.\nPrevious explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data\ngeneration processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary\nsystems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.\nSpecifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled\nvideo and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a\nhierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific\ndimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning\nprocess. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written\nquality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and\ngeneration efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset\ncontains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for\ninstruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and\njustification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy\nto fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a\nbenchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the\nquality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the\nS2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently\nimproves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video\nLMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\uff08SIG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08VQA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\uff08Score2Instruct\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684VQA\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIG\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\uff08S2I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42CoT\u5efa\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728S2I-Bench\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SIG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVQA\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, one major challenge is\nthe data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences\nat multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data\nheterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,\nfine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information\ncontained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client\nsemantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this\npaper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)\nto capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous\nclients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and\nconsistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class\nunderlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise\ncollaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive\nlearning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational\nprototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes.

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster\nnumber determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real\ndrift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and\na concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful\nhistorical information.

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data.

DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement.

However, we find that\nbiases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion\nframework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the\nlack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders\nprecise prediction.

We introduce ZKPROV, a novel\ncryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance.\nIt allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without\nrevealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior\napproaches that focus on complete verification of the training process\n(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution\nenvironments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically\nbinds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through\nzero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step.

Theoretical framework has also been provided where by\noptimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,\nresults in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus\ninducing antifragility.

The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream\nbackbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it\ndifficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel\nrelationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address\nthis issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration\nof local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise\nmodeling.

A lightweight channel attention\nmodule further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven\nimportance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)\ndatasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings\ndemonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline\nmodels, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG\nConformer baseline.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods.

However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information\nand also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and\nregression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale\ncost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising\nroute for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure\nhighly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the\nEnhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with\nsmall-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary\nfeatures into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from\nthe initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These\nfeatures are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a\ncompact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene\ngeometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large\nreceptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a\nhighly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo\nachieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX\nOrin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEnhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e3b\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u89c6\u5dee\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4f53\u79ef\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u4f53\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5219\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "ESM\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u53d6\u521d\u59cb\u89c6\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u6d17\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u6c99\u6f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "ESM\u5728\u9ad8\u7aefGPU\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230116 FPS\uff0cAGX Orin\u4e0a91 FPS\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u89c6\u5dee\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "ESM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5927\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}

This\nheterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but\nremains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types\nof nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very\nchallenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be\ncarefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert\nheterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which\nwill inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous\nrelations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of\nHomophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that\nexplicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and\nadaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH\nintroduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite\nsubgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs\nbased on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to\nalign heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual\ninformation. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of\nheterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs.

Our approach\nmitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized\nby low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological\nrelations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning\ntask. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines\ncross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the\nimpact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation\nprocess. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.

Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG\nbaseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\\% and +10.2\\%) in the SG3D benchmark,\neven outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.\nFurthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step\ninformation based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling\nGroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain\nits temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work\nintroduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGroundFlow\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u70b9\u4e91\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\uff08SG3D\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff083DVG\uff09\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728SG3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGroundFlow\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u67093DVG\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728SG3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGroundFlow\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08+7.5%\u548c+10.2%\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "GroundFlow\u4e3a3DVG\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728SG3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a\ngrowing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are\nlikely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same\nmodels. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when\nonly fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked\nwith our BitMark.

Existing approaches, Class\nIncremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection\n(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen\ndomains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new\nclasses, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more\npractical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an\nexemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging\nframework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign\nconflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,\nDuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function\nas real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both\nretention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),\nwhich combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting\nand the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common\nground.

This study\nintroduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)\napproach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK\nmethods.

The existing CL methods in RS,\nwhile learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.\nThis is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is\ncostly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we\npropose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of\nmasked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two\ncomponents: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data\nmixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions\nby interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous\ntasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling\nknowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by\ninterpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge\ndistillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at\nthe data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and\nreduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting.

We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement\non diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely\ndependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,\nenabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and\ntest. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model\ncomplexity and improve the generalization bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u6536\u655b\u540e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5373\u201cgrokking\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u201cgrokking\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67907B\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08OLMoE\uff09\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u201cgrokking\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u201cgrokking\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u6807\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer\nmodels; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient\nprocessing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear\nscaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length\nvideos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework\nincorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a\nstate space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal\ninformation. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a\nlocal-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate\nlocal dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models\ntemporal dependencies across the entire video.

From this viewpoint, the control problem traditionally\nstudied in the context of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is\nreformulated as a control problem for PDEs, specifically targeting the\noptimization and control of coefficients in parabolic and hyperbolic operators.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this specific problem has not yet been\nsystematically addressed in the control theory of PDEs.\n  To this end, we propose a dual system formulation for the control and\noptimization problem associated with parabolic PDEs, laying the groundwork for\nthe development of efficient numerical schemes in future research. We also\nprovide a theoretical proof showing that the control and optimization problem\nfor parabolic PDEs admits minimizers. Finally, we investigate the control\nproblem associated with hyperbolic PDEs and prove the existence of solutions\nfor a corresponding approximated control problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u4e3a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDEs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u629b\u7269\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u578b\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u629b\u7269\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3aPDEs\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684ODE\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3aPDEs\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u629b\u7269\u578bPDEs\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u629b\u7269\u578bPDEs\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53cc\u66f2\u578bPDEs\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aPDEs\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and\n(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable\nminima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness\ndoes imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily\ndeteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows.

While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving\nprototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to\nsystematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype\nrepresentativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and\nefficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates\nthrough an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query\nfeatures to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)\nanomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is\nachieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while\nthe anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike\nconventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting\nmakes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal\ntransport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the\ngap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.\nFor comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive\nprototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.\nExtensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and\nRealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our\napproach under 1/2/4-shots.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastRef\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08FS-IAD\uff09\u4e2d\u539f\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6291\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "method": "FastRef\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u79fb\u81f3\u539f\u578b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08MVTec\u3001ViSA\u3001MPDD\u3001RealIAD\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FastRef\u57281/2/4-shot\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "FastRef\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6291\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Contrasting with existing two-stage\nmethods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and\nparametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D\nparametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation\ncaused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,\nparametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view\noptimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their\ngeometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a\nnovel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and\nedge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a\ncurve-aware Gaussian representation, \\textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables\ndifferentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by\nmulti-view evidence.

The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector\ncollection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly\nlearned.

However, privacy concerns, such as\nadverse pricing, discrimination, and resource manipulation, deter farmers from\nsharing data, as it can be used against them. To address this barrier, we\npropose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and\ncollaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The\nframework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian\nnoise to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework allows\nresearchers to identify potential collaborators for a target farmer and train\npersonalized machine learning models either on the data of identified\ncollaborators via federated learning or directly on the aggregated\nprivacy-protected data. It also allows farmers to identify potential\ncollaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life\ndatasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks\nand utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how\nthis framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers\npursue broader research objectives.

This\nwork proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration\nfor TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for\nevenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly\nweighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9759\u6001\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u6570\uff08TMC\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u6570\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u62e5\u5835\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f30\u8ba1TMC\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177SUMO\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u53f7\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9759\u6001\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c90\u548c120\u79d2\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5468\u671f\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5cf0\u548c\u975e\u9ad8\u5cf0\u65f6\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

Existing\ntraining-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the\nuse of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during\ngeneration, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,\nand degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome\nthese challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a\nnovel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text\ngeneration with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC\nstep-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image\nand the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of\ncandidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual\nbaseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually\ngrounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time\ncontext alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring\nthe overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted\nacross diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,\nInstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces\nhallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference\nefficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an\neffective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,\nthereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices.

However, these\nmethods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying\nthe adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain\nlong-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To\naddress these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for\nself-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.\nFirst, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial\ndependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update\nstrategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions\nbetween spatial states for efficient structure modeling.

While recent diffusion-based view\nsynthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,\nthey generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object\nare occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction\nquality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for\nocclusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six\nstructurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,\nenabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or\nmanual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the\nPix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and\npseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and\nview consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully\nfine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view\ngeneration.

Many such publications use independent external specialists to\nreview submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are\ncalled referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee\nfor reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and\nthe number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these\npapers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts\nin all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should\nbe reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the\nbest reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.\n  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy\nto automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research\npaper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we\ncollect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the\nreferences. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic\nkeywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count\ntheir h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors.

While increasing the\nnumber of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the\nframe rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.\nMoreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when\nacquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot\ndenoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances\ncontrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the\navailable transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form\ncompound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are\nthen used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,\nenabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical\nstructures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while\nthe underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows\nthe network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the\nconsistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no\ndomain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across\nanatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports\nefficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight\narchitecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on\nsimulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement\nand structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based\ndenoising methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u89d2\u5ea6CPWC\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCPWC\u6210\u50cf\u589e\u52a0\u89d2\u5ea6\u6570\u91cf\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4f4e\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f20\u8f93\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u590d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u4f53\u6a21\u548c\u6d3b\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose the first\napproach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D\nsemantic occupancy prediction.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings.

They often follow\npre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,\nwhich can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and\neventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most\nexisting methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be\ninefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for\npreventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually\ndesigned rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive\nreplanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries\nby comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against\nreference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current\nscene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning\nmodule is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments\nin the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and\nspatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving\ntask success and robustness."}

Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic\nvariants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g.,\ngenome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint\nassociation analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we\nproposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees\nAssembling Mann whitney (TAMW).

We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions."}

Traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained\ntextual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed\nknowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods\naddress this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural\nassociations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and\nfine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization\nof textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called\nHGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and\nsemantic information via hypergraphs.

In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning.

Applied to\nmillion-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates\na latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,\nconsistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models\nlike VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type\nclassification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of\nintroducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire\nscientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This\nwork provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep\nlearning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable\nblueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models."}

However, fine-tuned\nvariants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data\nthat often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional\nshifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range\nof medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a\ntraining-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both\ngeneralist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical\nimage segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that\nrely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we\npropose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal\nlayer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we\ndevelop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and\ngeneralizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and\nmulti-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias\nand consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and\ngeneralization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%\non multi-task evaluations."}

In view of\nthis complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.\nTherefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed\nsimpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.\nThe comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is\nintrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.\nCombinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as\nthree sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by\ncontrolling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with\nthe same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10\ndiverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours,\nfreeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is\nsuggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate\noverlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned\npredictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and\nin contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost."}

We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations.

On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with\non-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over\nbaselines. We release the implementation at\nhttps://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to\ninspire further research."}

This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for\nContinuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate\nhigh-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process\nstable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms\nfor both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy\nimprovement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning\nexclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value\nlearning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using\nintra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module\nproviding intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk.

Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability.

A growing body of works have\nemerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,\nthese anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be\ntrained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly\ngeneration framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s\nstrong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a\nnormal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and\nnatural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in\nother regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement\n(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion\nbased on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in\nspecific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual\ntokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies\nneed to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose\nSelf-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal\nvisual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies\nare coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA\ndatasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its\nutility.

In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet).

The\ncore of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available\nmodels and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs\ncapturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We\nthen build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,\ncritically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,\npredicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target\ndomain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets\nagainst three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the\nbest model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model\nfor the rest."}

In\nresponse, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular\nframework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while\nmaintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework\narchitecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image\nrepresentations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU\nmemory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running\nin parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in\nfeature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while\nenabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We\ndemonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation\nusing DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object\ndetection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared\nto sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine\noffers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint\nwhile allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during\nruntime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++\n(Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse\nrobotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time\nperformance at $\\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized\nmodels."}

In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with\nstructured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic\nplanningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,\nlanguage-driven automation in chemical engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u6563\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FSMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u91cd\u63d0\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FSMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u91cd\u63d0\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684FSMs\u4e2d\uff0cGPT-4o\u548cGPT-4o-mini\u5728\u4e94\u6b21\u91cd\u63d0\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178PID\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\uff0cLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u9ad8\u5c42\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, current\nsystems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,\nwhich fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches\nshortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial\nrecomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV\ncache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the\nagent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a\nsteps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future\nactivation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node\nlevel, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently\nmanage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a\nfully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required\ntensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next\nstep, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation.

Two key\nchallenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training\ncaused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN\narchitectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we\nintroduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking\nTransformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech\nprocessing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)\nmechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep\nusing an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further\nintegrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a\nHierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module.

Biases,\noften arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,\ncompromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers\nare less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made\nstrides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the\ncritical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more\nrobust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on\nbiased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive\nsampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It\naddresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and\nsampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of\nall classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further\npropose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to\nassess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction.

We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its\ndesign and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.\nThe proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various\ngarment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional\nrobotic dressing assistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7a7f\u8863\u7cfb\u7edfSWAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u751f\u957f\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a7f\u8863\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u521a\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u5f62\u8863\u7269\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u884c\u52a8\u4e0d\u4fbf\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a7f\u8863\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u521a\u6027\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5236\u9020\u4e86SWAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0e\u8863\u7269\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "result": "SWAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8863\u7269\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7a7f\u8863\u8f85\u52a9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "SWAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a7f\u8863\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems.

To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization\n(CI-AVL), a novel task that leverages images from different instances of the\nsame sound event category to localize target sound sources, thereby reducing\ndependence on paired data while enhancing generalization capabilities. Our\nproposed VP-SelDoA tackles this challenging task through a semantic-level\nmodality fusion and employs a Frequency-Temporal ConMamba architecture to\ngenerate target-selective masks for sound isolation. We further develop a\nSemantic-Spatial Matching mechanism that aligns the heterogeneous semantic and\nspatial features via integrated cross- and self-attention mechanisms. To\nfacilitate the CI-AVL research, we construct a large-scale dataset named\nVGG-SSL, comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 sound event\ncategories.

However,\ntheir generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and\nsocietal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or\ncopyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning\n(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable\nconcepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness\nof existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in\nthe presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework\nexplicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike\nexisting approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall\nexploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion\nmodels by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a\nsingle semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten\nstate-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial\neffectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the\noriginal textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in\ncurrent unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions\nto ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Recent methods for CIR leverage large\npretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on\ngeneral-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle\nwith application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary\nused in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language\nunderstanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion\ndatasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of\nmanual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce\nFACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It\nleverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline\npowered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and\ndetailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,\nwhich fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight\nadapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for\nfine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and\nwithout additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced\nevaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain\nhigher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of\nFashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's\nperformance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained\nmodification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a\nhighly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network\n(DMF2Mel), which consists of four core components: the Dynamic Contrastive\nFeature Aggregation Module (DC-FAM), the Hierarchical Attention-Guided\nMulti-Scale Network (HAMS-Net), the SplineMap attention mechanism, and the\nbidirectional state space module (convMamba). Specifically, the DC-FAM\nseparates speech-related \"foreground features\" from noisy \"background features\"\nthrough local convolution and global attention mechanisms, effectively\nsuppressing interference and enhancing the representation of transient signals.\nHAMS-Net, based on the U-Net framework,achieves cross-scale fusion of\nhigh-level semantics and low-level details. The SplineMap attention mechanism\nintegrates the Adaptive Gated Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AGKAN) to combine\nglobal context modeling with spline-based local fitting. The convMamba captures\nlong-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity and enhances nonlinear\ndynamic modeling capabilities.

To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through\ntargeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,\nclinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in\nmedical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b466\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684PatientSafetyBench\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u533b\u7597LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u533b\u7597LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Among them, the style embeddings\ninspired by image style transfer, extracted from the CLAP model and the sound\nmatching model, remarkably outperform the others, showing their potential in\nmodeling timbre similarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u97f3\u8272\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u97f3\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5d4c\u5165\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u548c\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eCLAP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u58f0\u97f3\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u97f3\u8272\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such\nparameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight\nstructures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we\nstudy the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights\nin the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular\narchitectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective\nsparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the\nliterature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our\nsetting.

Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color\nembeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when\nexplicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID\ndatasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for\nimage-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID\nwithout relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential\nof color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in\nCC-ReID.

At\neach stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the\ncables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by\ndetecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or\ncable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using\nonly motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,\nunsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a\nbrief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on\nknown anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using\nMahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds\ntriggering anomaly flags.

PlanQA is grounded in\nstructured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,\nand bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The\nbenchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and\ntopological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also\ninterior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and\nusability.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold.

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model.

This study explores\nwhether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through\nmultimodal learning can further improve detection performance.

To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional\nnetwork with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and\nradar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing\nmodality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating\ngestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made\npublicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework\nimproves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU\nmodels, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still\nachieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs.

The de facto approach to solving the\nproblem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason\nthrough the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to\ngenerate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and\ncan be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering\n(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging\nRL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance\nsignals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally\nimportant metric, which has received less attention.

(2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help\nRAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of\nsearches at inference time.

To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples.

In our model, several base stations (BSs)\nwith heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL\ntraining incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can\nprocess only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource\nblocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter\ntransmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user\nscheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL\nmethod requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to\ndetermine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication\noverhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the\ntraining loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB\nallocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we\npropose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to\nindependently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the\nconnected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks\nacross all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large\npenalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that\nassigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet\ncommunication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to\nquickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation\nresults show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%\nand the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CFL\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DPVD-MARL\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u57fa\u7ad9\uff08BSs\uff09\u548c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7528\u6237\u4e0b\u7684CFL\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DPVD-MARL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5757\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u60e9\u7f5a\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0cDPVD-MARL\u6bd4\u72ec\u7acbQ\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u7d2f\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u9ad815%\u3002", "conclusion": "DPVD-MARL\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86CFL\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative\ntraining, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information\nfrom devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data\ninformation, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it\nis necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal\ntransmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to\neach model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization\nproblem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while\nmeeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning\nframework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that\nenables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the\ndeceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models\nassigned to each model training device without knowing the position and\nmonitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module\nto encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to\ndetermine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving\ntraining efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nimproves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to\neavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6b3a\u9a97\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u884c\u52a8\u8005-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08SAC\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5728\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff08ICM\uff09\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08CA\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u5907\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473\u500d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u51cf\u5c1113%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity.

The\nsummarization step reduced the average training time of individual components\nby 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge\ngraph-based RAG systems.

We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its\nintegrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a \"dual-domain\ndataset,\" a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both\nmolecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure\nquality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves\nsignificant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical\nvalidity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis\nroutes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic\ncorrectness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis\nfeasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed\ncompetitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it\nalso highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in\nstereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference\nhallucination.

Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of\nraw text has been seen as privacy-preserving.

The\nunexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct\nfurther verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and\nopaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to\ninput sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization\ntechniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization\noffering a simpler and more widely applicable solution.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,\nparticularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing\nfacial structures.

It pioneers an innovative dual\nlens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional\nontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary\nbreakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including\nlow-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal\nhandling.

Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate\nreward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution\nscenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the\nsame distribution.

Through extensive experiments on five language\nmodels of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different\nsizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard\ninstruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited\nrobustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight\nfor prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens\nyields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better\nstarting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These\nfindings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer\nactionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

In this review, we\ndiscuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications\nof those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.\nWhile many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect\nthat the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the\ncoming years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPMs\uff09\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u3001\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u524d\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u6210\u719f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u4e14\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u5168\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u5176\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5e74\u6210\u719f\u3002"}}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage\nmulti-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair\ntransfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view\ntraining data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,\na data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion\nmodel to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference\nhairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs.

The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of\nIoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both\nprivacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)\noffers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without\nexposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx\noften fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and\nnon-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint\nmalware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E\n(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports\nindirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.\nEach client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact\nsummaries to the server.

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical.

Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap.

Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap.

However, these models often\nexhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can\ncompromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular\nfocus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition\nperformance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and\nwhether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and\nattention patterns, especially for \"neutral\", \"sadness\", and \"anger\" in elderly\nindividuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias\nmitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted\nLoss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with\nautomatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets\nthat include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements\nin recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most\nerror-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained\nwith age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age\ngroup, helping to explain the observed improvements.

To\nclose the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the\ngeneration of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,\ngenerating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,\nposes a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,\nsafety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which\nsignals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC\nsystem, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already\nestablished as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory\nepilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements\nor specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the\neffect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments\nare standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients\nwhile failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal\nhealth data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile\nand robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To\nshow the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical\nrequirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine\nlearning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only\nlimited data on the GBA modulation exists.

Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning\noutcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU\nloss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic\nexpression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted\non three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal\ndatasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional\narithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance\nissues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression\nknowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label\nimbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a\ndiverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.\nThis underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in\nmainstream datasets within this domain.

Traditional approaches often rely on a single data\nmodality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology.

We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal\nVariational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for\nsurvival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,\nfour molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages\nmodality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,\nenabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific\ninformation. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically\nmeaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific\ninsights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed\nclinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,\ndata-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer\ncohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,\ndimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization.

Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,\nMP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical\nvariability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless\ntumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models\noffer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained\nclinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06Vision Transformers\uff08ViT\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\uff08PS\uff09\u548c\u591a\u60a3\u8005\uff08MP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002PS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800cMP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752831\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u76844DCT\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3MP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7b2c32\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002PS\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u57fa\u4e8e16\u5f20DRR\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b1\u79d2\u5185\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ADE\u548cFDE\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "PS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u6570\u636e\uff08T1\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff1bMP\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u5bf9\u5206\u6b21\u95f4\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u6570\u636e\uff08T2\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1PS\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "ViT\u67b6\u6784\u9996\u6b21\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u80bf\u7624\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cPS\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u800cMP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often\ndecouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,\nhowever, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of\nplasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct\nan in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly\naggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks\nthrough simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple\nyet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image\nfeatures for query assignment, ensuring \"perfect alignment\" to preserve\nobjectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to\npromote plasticity.

Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces\nirregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.\nIt transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing\nmultiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further\noptimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections\nand applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three\nfast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of\ncommon embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT\nachieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and\n27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned\nmodels, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT\nmatches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring\nsignificantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time\npruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free\ndeployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "UnIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4e58\u52a0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MCU\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65e0SIMD\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "UnIT\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8df3\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4e58\u52a0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728MSP430\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0a\uff0cUnIT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8611.02%\u81f382.03%\u7684\u4e58\u52a0\u64cd\u4f5c\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534727.30%\u81f384.19%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e27.33%\u81f384.38%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u526a\u679d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eMCU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

They are a critical tool\nin applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater\nconstruction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image\nrestoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited\ndepth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate\nunrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and\nsignificant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by\ncombining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --\nwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an\nexplicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the\neffects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a\nphysics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and\nrealistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image\ndatasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with\ndense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance.

While these techniques already establish\nthat data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on\nhigh-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and\ndesigned prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes\nlittle to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,\nbenign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction.

ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels.

Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they\nadequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large\nlanguage model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better\nand even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each\nlayer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple\ntimes as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary\norders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space\ngreatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained\nmodules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample\nfrom math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a\nfixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same\nlayer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic\narchitectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the\nMCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples\nwith correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,\nsuggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of\nsamples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving\ncorrect predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution\nthrough pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific\nadaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)\nacross three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,\nEUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM\nexhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version\nof TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained\nversion achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and\n15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's\nzero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting\nand equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can\nsurpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model\nconsistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable\nperformance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant\nsample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,\ntraditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of\nthree tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific\noptimisation.

To overcome this limitation, we\ndeveloped a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation\nResidual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by\nintegrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms\nin the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and\nquantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,\nnamely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures.

While existing\nN-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order\ncomparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on\ntask-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,\nwe propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk\nminimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to\nenhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation\nprocesses of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic\nformulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk\nestimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We\nfurther establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support.

Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural\nnetworks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners\ncan dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal\nlearning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay\nbetween evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search\nfor optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the\nlearning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to\ninterpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine\nstatistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to\nidentify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the\nhigh-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations\nthat track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order\nparameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control\nproblem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of\nminimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework\nencompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and\ncontrol budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal\ncurricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising\nautoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how\noptimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing\nalignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.\nFinally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets.

Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g.

YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The\nresults showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent\naccuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m\nof the inclinometer sensor data.

We\ndemonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across\ndomains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which\nis the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of\nimage distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the\nteledermatology process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66IQA\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u975e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66IQA\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66IQA\u6570\u636e\u5e93Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66IQA\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)\nframework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of\ntargets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance\nthrough a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with\nbackbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.\nExtensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that\nEBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEBC-ZIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u81a8\u80c0\u6cca\u677e\u56de\u5f52\u6539\u8fdb\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u81a8\u80c0\u6cca\u677e\u56de\u5f52\uff08ZIP\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u5f52\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u5757\u5206\u7c7b\uff08EBC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEBC-ZIP\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eEBC\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "EBC-ZIP\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6982\u7387\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This\nmotivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when\ndebating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,\nand can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported\nthat large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive\nbiases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward\nidentity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate\nwhether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic\nattributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and\nproprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity\ndiscernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific\nevidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity\ndiscernment relative to models without personas.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a\nnew modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman\ntheory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by\nthe idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs\nthe Koopman operators from data.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy.

However, removing\nundesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality\nremains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive\nModel (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept\nerasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation\n(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and\nThresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the\ntarget concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,\nErase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more\nrigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR\nmodels. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of\ntarget-replacement concept prompt pairs.

The\nautomatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria\nfrom a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each\npruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of\nthe training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the\nnetwork is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in\nthe network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual\nallocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on\nthe VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the\nResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the\ntop-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network\nFLOPs by 52\\%.

In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring\nthe uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a\nsimilar activation vector to the query for each layer.

Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,\nexact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV\nincreased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,\nFramework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.\nbaselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per\n1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and\nUSD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.\nHuman-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported\nFramework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR\n(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and\nreduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an\neffective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5LLM\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6b63\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\uff08PPV\uff09\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6821\u5bf9\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u7684PPV\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u67901,000\u4efd\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u52a0\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30PPV\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6PPV\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.159\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e42.6%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5LLM\u6846\u67b6\u662fAI\u8f85\u52a9\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their\ntypical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs\nhave largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard\nAO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from\nrefinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the\nlanguage's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural\ninfluences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that\nwhile encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,\ndecoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\\sim25\\times$) and\ncomparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly\nlarger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core\nparadigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for\nfuture model design.

CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance\n(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall\n(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the\nchallenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively\ndiscriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the\nMistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of\nCCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant\nvalidity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared\nto the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior\ndiscriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being\nsignificantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,\ncomprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving\nRAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CCRS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u6307\u6807\u6216\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCCRS\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff08CC\u3001QR\u3001ID\u3001AC\u3001IR\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728BioASQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cCCRS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5982Mistral-7B\u4f18\u4e8eLlama\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8eRAGChecker\u3002", "conclusion": "CCRS\u4e3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the\nSPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase\nrecognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming\nfull-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced\ntransformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through\nadaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing\nfocus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive\nexperiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12\nbackbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the\neffectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer\nreconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced\ntransformation reduces intra-class variations.

This common approach struggles to model complex temporal\ndependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of\nuncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which\napply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to\naddress this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion\ntechniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by\nintroducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to\nsuccessfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant\ndesign of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM\ncomponents-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the\nrolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three\nkey contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model\ncapacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to\nstochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained\nEDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture\nfor robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D\nNavier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\\circ\nresolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,\nincluding conditional autoregressive EDM.

Drawing on the\naforementioned considerations, a vision-free, model-agnostic meta-method for\ncompensating robotic position errors is proposed, which maximizes the\nprobability of accurate robotic position via interactive feedback. Meanwhile,\nthe proposed method endows the robot with the capability to learn and adapt to\nvarious position errors, which is inspired by the human's instinct for grasping\nunder uncertainties. Furthermore, it is a self-learning and self-adaptive\nmethod able to accelerate the robotic positioning process as more examples are\nincorporated and learned. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.

To\naddress the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial\ntransformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u6ce8\u518c\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08MSI\uff09\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5149\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SPL\uff09\u548c\u76f2\u7a00\u758f\u878d\u5408\uff08BSF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u9f50HSI\u548cMSI\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528SPL\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6HSI\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u589e\u5f3aMSI\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u518cHSI\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51faBSF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b49\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u6027\uff1b4. \u91c7\u7528PAO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3BSF\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u518c\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BSF\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This\ndenoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned\nlatent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of\nhigher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with existing diffusion frameworks.

Existing radiomic\napproaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at\nthe population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While\ninterpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent\nindividual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based\napproaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent\nend-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic\nfeatures. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic\nselection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the\npoor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic\nfingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is\ndynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the\nexisting radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient\nbasis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and\nselecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual\npatients.

We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare\nLSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED\noutperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness\nmeasures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced\nnon-stationary data streams.

We provide theoretical\nanalysis characterizing the variance and sample-efficiency improvement, and\ndemonstrate empirically in autonomous driving and quadruped robotics settings\nthat our approach achieves high-probability bounds with markedly improved\nsample efficiency. Our technique can lower the real-world testing burden for\nvalidating the performance of the stack, thereby enabling more efficient and\ncost-effective experimental evaluation of robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5ec9\u4ef7\u8f85\u52a9\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u4eff\u771f\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3002"}}

Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable\nperceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively\nimpacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.\nTo systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and\nperformance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual\nquestion-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse\nset of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key\ndomains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction\nunderstanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social\nnavigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected\ndata from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue\nunderstanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four\ndomains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of\n1000 questions for HRIBench.

The Supporter assists the Seeker\nby transmitting a compressed representation of its local map under bandwidth\nconstraints to support the Seeker's path-planning task. We introduce a bit-rate\nmetric based on the expected binary codeword length to quantify communication\ncost. Using this metric, we formulate the compression design problem as a\nrate-distortion optimization problem that determines when to communicate, which\nregions of the map should be included in the compressed representation, and at\nwhat resolution (i.e., quantization level) they should be encoded. Our\nformulation allows different map regions to be encoded at varying quantization\nlevels based on their relevance to the Seeker's path-planning task.

The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,\nwhich connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing\nfeature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image\nposition encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT\nachieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson\nAGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,\noutperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose\nDyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by\nselecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search\narea features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an\nefficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios.

Under Review", "summary": "We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to\nperform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human\ndemonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

However, training\ndiffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and\nexisting zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond\ntraining resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and\nspatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,\nzero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural\ncoherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion\nmodels. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from\nthe pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel\nwavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion\nmethods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the\nbase image.

In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama.

This makes frequent\nassessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and\nminimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of\nrock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground\nmines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock\nbolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the\nautomatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point\nclouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing\ntechniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature\nengineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such\ntechniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due\nto data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.\nMoreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale\npoint clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of\nreinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an\napproach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning\narchitecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the\nautomatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point\nclouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nmodels by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.\nAdditionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,\nachieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,\ndemonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDeepBolt\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u7684\u5927\u578b3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5ca9\u951a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u4e2d\u5ca9\u951a\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u7ef4\u6301\u5ca9\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u98ce\u9669\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u6076\u52a3\u548c\u8017\u65f6\u800c\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784DeepBolt\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u67423D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5ca9\u951a\u3002", "result": "DeepBolt\u5728\u5ca9\u951a\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684IoU\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51fa42.5%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523096.41%\u548c96.96%\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepBolt\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ca9\u951a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth\ndetection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling\nprecise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models\nsegment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal\nvs. angular) via geometric analysis.

However, deploying LLM-based agents\nin high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.\nUnethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world\nconsequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer\nthe ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model\nediting task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area\nof research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while\npreserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate\nthis approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in\npsychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and\nediting of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier\nintroducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that\nBehavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within\nspecific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only\nscenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an\nagent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be\nused to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce\nharmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents\nbased on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior\nEditing across different models and scenarios.

The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs\nare particularly useful for code generation.

To demystify\nthe decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we\nsystematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.\nFor RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and\nmaintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel\nsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used\nin training.

However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to\nbe effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce\nsemi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.\nState-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial\nCNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional\nneural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a\nchallenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to\nfully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to\nconstruct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image\nmodeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with\nmasked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels\nfrom labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked\ndomain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and\ndevise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the\noriginal and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.\nWe also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings\nfrom LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in\ntraining with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining\ndata, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method\nis responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with\ninsights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping\ntraining regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs\nbetween values during model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u793e\u4ea4\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u5bf9\u6548\u7528\u503c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6743\u8861\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4f20\u8fbe\u771f\u76f8\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u4fe1\u4efb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u793c\u8c8c\u8a00\u8bed\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6548\u7528\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u504f\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u5bf9\u6548\u7528\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6bd4\u53cd\u9988\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u6301\u4e45\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684LLM\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u884c\u4e3a\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u6743\u8861\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands\nand data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL\nis handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.\nCurrent solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or\ncustomizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a\nwell-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.\nAdditionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from\nintroducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data\nleakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation\nframework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).\nSpecifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic\ndata. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their\nparameters are frozen.

To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages.

Our comparative\nevaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and\nMABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and\nother energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to\nenhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while\ngenerating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy\nconcerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study\nutilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time\nresolution.

Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of\nour method.

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized.

However, learning-based methods often face challenges\nwith limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform\ncompared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While\niterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are\nconsiderably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,\nwe propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines\nthe strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better\nbalance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement\nentropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each\nvoxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it\nintroduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy\nreceives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level\nimage pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential\ncomplexity growth.

MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong\ngeneralization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in\nseizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on\nour SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard\ntime-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds\nexisting attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as\na general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and\nMVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation\nmodel with state-of-the-art clinical performance.

Due to the\nsignificant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,\nresulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and\npredicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced\nfeature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of\nthe data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome\nthis issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,\nthe objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection\nmethod that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This\napproach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further\ncategorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The\ncomparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently\nachieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the\ntaxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select\nfeatures was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights\ninto what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study\nprovides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add\na layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational\ncomplexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making.

Regardless of their successes, current methods\nfrequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the\nsame distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While\ngraph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional\nmessage-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)\nbenchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely\nunexplored.\n  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of\nbackbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in\nOOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading\ndomain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their\nperformance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.\nOur results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently\ndemonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without\nspecialized DG algorithms.\n  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that\ncompares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,\nspecifically examining domain alignment and class separation.

This is a critical challenge in natural\nlanguage generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and\nmedical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to\noptimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency\nproperties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient\nalgorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open\nquestions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and\nBayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and\ndeferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a\nfixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a\nfamily of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove\n$H$-consistency for a selected member.

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining\ntask accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a\ndiffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes\nsemantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with\nself-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our\nmodel also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion\nto ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio\nenvironments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric\nthat better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.\nExperimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,\nDiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable\nperformance under dynamic channels.

PDD is an iterative, five-step\nprocess that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters,\nii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs\nfrom simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device\nperformance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,\nmaterial science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.\nHowever, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily\ncostly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large\noptimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical\ncharacterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication\nprocesses.

In practical settings,\nhowever, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often\nbefore previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes\nthe WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same\nsite as distinct classes.

This leads to overlapping traffic segments,\nand similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,\nthereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named\nADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation\nto salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention\ncropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features\nfrom both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules\nto capture the global contextual patterns of the trace.

Existing security paradigms often fail to\naddress a foundational \"Trinity of Trust,\" comprising the fidelity of the\nsystem model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the\nanalytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC\nframework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,\nclosed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based \"Blue Agent\" defender is\ncontinuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats\ndiscovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to\nbecome progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously\nprobe and patch its own vulnerabilities.

However, in many\npractical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,\nrendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial\nviolations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods\nfor finding an $\\epsilon$-$surely\\ feasible\\ stochastic\\ optimal$\n($\\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically\nbounded by $\\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\\epsilon$.\nOur methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified\nvariance-reduced ASG scheme $only\\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty\nsubproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish\nfirst-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an\n$\\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle\ncomplexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an\n$\\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our\nproposed methods to solve the sample average problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

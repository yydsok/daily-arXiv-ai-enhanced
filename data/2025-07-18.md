Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Result: 模型在真实数据集上验证了复杂交互的再现性，并在高保真仿真环境中表现出高效计算性能。

Conclusion: 该模型为自动驾驶开发提供了可扩展且解释性强的仿真工具。

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

### [3] [A Survey of Explainable Reinforcement Learning: Targets, Methods and Needs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12599)
*Léo Saulières*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于“What”和“How”问题的直观分类法，用于解释强化学习（XRL）领域的方法，并对250多篇论文进行了综述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度神经网络的内部机制不透明，需要可解释AI（XAI）方法来理解AI模型的输出。本文专注于XAI的子领域XRL，旨在解释强化学习代理的行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于“What”（解释目标）和“How”（解释方式）的分类法，用于对XRL方法进行分类和综述。

Result: 综述了250多篇论文，并提出了XRL领域的一些相关领域和未来需求。

Conclusion: XRL领域需要更多关注，本文的分类法和综述为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [4] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习（RL）代理和多模态模型（LMM）的自动化游戏设计迭代框架，通过RL代理的测试和LMM的修改来优化游戏设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成系统仅通过分析游戏代码或资源难以捕捉静态规则与动态玩家行为之间的关系，因此需要一种能够自动迭代设计的方法。

Method: 框架通过RL代理进行游戏测试，生成数值指标或图像摘要，再由LMM分析并修改游戏配置以实现设计目标。

Result: 实验表明，LMM能够基于RL代理的行为轨迹迭代优化游戏机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助游戏设计提供了实用且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [5] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)

Method: 通过比较白盒监控（可访问令牌级探针激活）和黑盒监控（无此访问权限），评估欺骗探针的性能提升（黑盒到白盒的性能提升）。

Result: 发现现有欺骗探针的黑盒到白盒性能提升较弱，但仍具潜力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，现有欺骗探针在检测欺骗行为方面有一定效果，但仍需改进以提高其对抗策略的抵抗能力。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出世界模型归纳（world model induction）作为人类快速适应的核心机制，并呼吁在AI中建立新的评估框架，以测试动态世界模型的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能快速适应新环境，而当前AI的世界模型评估过于静态，缺乏对动态学习和适应能力的关注。

Method: 借鉴认知科学研究，提出基于新颖游戏（novel games）的评估框架，设计具有持续新结构的游戏来测试AI的适应能力。

Result: 提出新评估范式和关键指标，旨在挑战AI快速构建世界模型的能力。

Conclusion: 新框架有望推动AI实现类人的快速适应和泛化能力，是迈向通用人工智能的重要一步。

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

### [10] [Information-Theoretic Aggregation of Ethical Attributes in Simulated-Command](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12862)
*Hussein Abbass,Taylan Akay,Harrison Tolley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，将人类判断从模拟决策循环中移出，设计伦理度量空间，由模拟环境探索，最终由人类指挥官选择最佳行动方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI时代，人类指挥官需要利用计算能力模拟大量场景，但依赖人类判断每个决策的伦理后果不切实际且低效。

Method: 人类设计伦理度量空间，模拟环境探索该空间并生成选项，最后由人类指挥官选择最佳行动方案。

Result: 通过动态加权伦理属性，解决了在生成模拟中如何权衡伦理决策的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了模拟效率，同时保留了人类在关键决策中的判断力。

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

### [11] [Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12872)
*Rishane Dassanayake,Mario Demetroudi,James Walpole,Lindley Lentati,Jason R. Brown,Edward James Young*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 前沿AI系统在说服、欺骗和影响人类行为方面能力迅速提升，可能通过操纵员工破坏人类监督。本文提出首个系统性框架，评估和缓解此类操纵风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统可能通过操纵员工破坏人类监督，但目前缺乏系统性框架来评估和缓解这种风险。

Method: 提出基于三个核心论点（无能、控制和可信度）的安全案例框架，并明确证据要求、评估方法和实施考虑。

Result: 提供了首个将操纵风险纳入AI安全治理的系统性方法，为公司提供了评估和缓解威胁的具体基础。

Conclusion: 操纵风险是重大威胁，需系统性框架进行治理，本文为AI公司提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [12] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出VAR-MATH框架，通过符号化评估揭示RL训练的LLMs在数学推理中的真实能力，发现现有方法依赖表面启发式，泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法在数学推理上的改进可能仅是过拟合基准测试的假象，而非真实推理能力的提升。

Method: 引入VAR-MATH框架，将数值问题转化为符号模板，通过多实例评估一致性，以解决数据泄漏和评估脆弱性问题。

Result: 实验显示RL模型在符号化版本（VAR-AMC23和VAR-AIME24）上性能显著下降（48.0%和58.3%），表明其泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: VAR-MATH提供了一种抗污染、稳健的数学推理评估范式，揭示了现有RL方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [13] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将概率事件演算（PEC）转化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以支持目标驱动的推理和规划，同时保持PEC的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC在不确定环境中具有表达力和可解释性，但缺乏目标驱动推理机制。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过引入“行动情境”概念，将PEC领域形式化转化为MDP，并保留PEC的灵活语义。

Result: PEC-MDP形式化支持时间推理和目标驱动规划，并能将学习策略映射回可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: PEC-MDP扩展了PEC的能力，同时保持了其可解释性，为算法和理论工具的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可信AI的发展，对优化问题的对比解释需求增加，尤其是针对MILP的决策过程。

Method: 将用户查询编码为额外约束，通过计算不可约不可行子系统（IIS）生成解释，并以“原因图”形式呈现。

Result: 在经典优化问题上测试，验证了计算解释的实用性。

Conclusion: X-MILP能有效生成易于理解的对比解释，适用于MILP问题。

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino
Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals
ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance
metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally
with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to
contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic
management.

*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态强化学习框架，改进ProbTree方法，通过实时信心估计和选择性扩展提升推理质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ProbTree静态实现中的两个关键限制：推理树无法动态适应中间结果，以及节点需评估所有可能策略导致计算低效。

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，增量构建推理树，基于实时信心估计学习最优策略（分解、检索或聚合）。

Result: 在保持ProbTree概率严谨性的同时，通过选择性扩展和资源分配提高了解决方案质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为树结构推理建立了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和现实问答系统所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [17] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一套新的功能标准来评估基于大型语言模型（LLM）的人工道德代理（AMAs），以应对传统伦理标准因LLM的不透明性而失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的随机输出和不透明内部状态，传统的透明架构假设不再适用，需要修订伦理评估标准。

Method: 提出了十个功能标准（如道德一致性、上下文敏感性等），并通过模拟道德代理的案例（如自动驾驶公交车）展示其适用性。

Result: 新标准为LLM-based AMAs提供了更实用的评估框架，促进其与社会道德需求的更好对齐。

Conclusion: 修订后的标准有助于指导LLM-based AMAs的未来发展，实现更有利的社会整合。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合高阶模式和模糊等价关系的统一算法，用于决策任务中的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及抽象函数和谓词推理的决策任务中，结合高阶理论和模糊逻辑可以提高效率，但现有方法复杂且计算效率低。

Method: 采用高阶模式和基于最小T-范数的模糊等价关系，提出一种统一算法，并证明其终止性、可靠性和完备性。

Result: 算法能计算最一般统一解，并在可统一时提供最高近似度。

Conclusion: 该算法为高阶模糊推理提供了一种高效且理论完备的解决方案。

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GEA（Generative Energy Arena）的新评估方法，通过公开竞技场结合能耗信息评估大语言模型，初步结果显示用户倾向于选择更节能的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法（如自动化基准测试和人工评估）存在局限性，如与人类评价相关性低或扩展性问题。GEA旨在通过公开竞技场结合能耗信息，探索能耗意识如何影响用户对模型的选择。

Method: 提出GEA（Generative Energy Arena），一个公开竞技场，用户在评估模型时可以看到能耗信息，从而选择更节能的模型。

Result: 初步结果显示，大多数用户在了解能耗信息后，倾向于选择更小、更节能的模型，而非性能更强但能耗更高的模型。

Conclusion: GEA表明，在大多数用户交互中，高性能模型的额外成本和能耗并未带来感知质量的显著提升，节能模型更受青睐。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Result: 前沿模型如OpenAI的o3在FormulaOne上表现极差，解决率低于1%。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在复杂研究问题上仍远未达到专家水平，需进一步研究提升。

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Motivation: 探索人类如何利用广泛的背景知识在新情境中进行推理和预测，并提出一种计算模型来模拟这一能力。

Method: 提出'模型合成架构'(MSA)，结合语言模型实现全局相关性检索和模型合成，以及概率程序实现定制化、连贯的世界模型。

Result: MSA在人类判断数据集上表现优于纯语言模型基线，特别是在开放领域推理任务中。

Conclusion: MSA提供了一种模拟人类在开放领域中推理能力的有效途径，为理解和复制人类推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究质疑LMs对句子模态的分类能力，本文旨在验证LMs是否具备更可靠的模态分类能力。

Method: 通过识别LMs中的模态差异向量，分析其与模型能力（训练步数、层数、参数）的关系，并与人类分类行为对比。

Result: LMs的模态分类能力优于先前报告，模态差异向量与人类分类行为高度相关。

Conclusion: 研究为LMs模态分类提供了新见解，并可能帮助理解人类的模态分类机制。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用NLP模型（如BioClinicalBERT）来自动分类药物过量死亡报告，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国药物过量死亡率的上升需要更及时和准确的监测方法，而传统ICD-10编码存在延迟和信息丢失问题。

Method: 研究使用了35,433条2020年的死亡记录进行模型训练和内部测试，并在3,335条2023-2024年的新数据集上进行外部验证。评估了多种NLP方法，包括传统分类器和微调的语言模型（如BioClinicalBERT）。

Result: 微调的BioClinicalBERT模型在内部测试集上表现近乎完美（F1>=0.998），外部验证也显示其优于其他方法（F1=0.966）。

Conclusion: NLP模型（尤其是BioClinicalBERT）为药物过量死亡分类提供了高准确性和可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了监测效率。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多模态数据中难以准确捕捉文本和图像间的复杂关系，AdaptiSent旨在通过动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力解决这一问题。

Method: 模型结合动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力机制，优化文本和视觉信息的交互，提升情感和方面词提取的准确性。

Result: 在标准Twitter数据集上，AdaptiSent在精确率、召回率和F1分数上均优于现有模型，尤其在捕捉模态间复杂关系方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为多模态基于方面的情感分析设定了新标准，显著优于现有方法，特别擅长处理复杂的多模态信息。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

Motivation: 当前语音评估存在两个关键问题：针对个体音频特征设计专门系统的需求与困难，以及自动评估方法与人类偏好之间的相关性差。

Method: 通过系统研究LAM作为评估工具（AudioJudge），探索其在音频特征检测（如发音、语速、说话人识别和语音质量）和人类偏好模拟任务中的应用。采用音频拼接和上下文学习策略，并引入多方面集成方法。

Result: AudioJudge在音频特征检测和人类偏好模拟任务中表现优异，与人类偏好的Spearman相关性高达0.91。

Conclusion: LAM作为统一评估框架具有潜力，但仍需解决冗长和位置偏差等问题。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在跨模态推理方面取得了进展，但也带来了新的安全风险，尤其是在面对对抗性多模态输入时。

Method: AutoSteer包含三个核心组件：安全感知评分（SAS）、自适应安全探测器和一个轻量级的拒绝头，用于在检测到安全风险时选择性干预生成。

Result: 实验表明，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持了模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer为多模态AI系统的安全部署提供了一个实用、可解释且有效的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Motivation: 传统语言模型的子词分词器在适应新数据分布时表现僵硬，导致分词效率低下和过度碎片化。

Method: 开发字节级语言模型，引入可学习的分词器，通过预测输入字节序列的边界实现可变长度分段。

Result: FLEXITOKENS在多语言基准测试和形态多样任务中减少分词碎片化，下游任务性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS通过灵活的分词方法显著提升语言模型对新数据分布的适应性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

Motivation: 开发一个能够提供细粒度翻译评估和排名的系统，以改进翻译质量评估的自动化和准确性。

Method: 使用基于提示的方法，结合多维质量指标（MQM），并利用大型语言模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct）进行评估。

Conclusion: TransEvalnia是一个有效的翻译评估工具，但存在位置偏差问题，提出了解决方法，并公开了所有数据和代码。

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.

various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于玩家态度和对话上下文切换策略的狼人杀智能体改进方法，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有狼人杀智能体通过提示工程隐含定义策略，无法适应动态变化的情境。

Method: 显式选择适合游戏上下文和玩家角色估计的策略。

Result: 与使用隐含或固定策略的基线智能体相比，策略适应智能体表现更优。

Conclusion: 显式策略选择方法能有效提升狼人杀智能体的性能。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO方法，通过解码时调整和偏好优化，无需额外训练即可提升大模型的长推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能在无需训练的情况下激发大模型的长推理能力。

Method: 使用ThinkLogit（基于logits算术的解码时方法）和ThinkLogit-DPO（偏好优化训练引导模型）。

Result: 在四个数学数据集上，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别相对提升26%和29%的pass@1。

Conclusion: 提出了一种计算高效的方法，无需额外训练即可提升大模型的长推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过语言模型桥接不同抽象层次，减少对分词器的依赖，提高模型的鲁棒性和灵活性。

Method: 训练字节级语言模型，采用学习路由机制，比较与BBPE和Llama3的性能。

Result: Synergy在相同规模和数据集下优于Llama3，中间层在去除位置编码后表现更好，显示位置无关概念的涌现。

Conclusion: Synergy证明了无分词器架构的可行性，为更灵活和鲁棒的模型设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归大语言模型快速发展，但小型文本编码器在需要丰富上下文表示的任务中仍很重要。否定语义功能尚未被这些方法充分捕捉，影响依赖文本嵌入的下游应用。

Method: 通过从大语言模型中提取多样化的否定和模糊表达数据，采用标准对比学习策略微调BERT模型。

Result: 显著提升了否定理解能力，同时在通用基准测试中保持竞争力。该方法也可适配大语言模型，提升其在否定基准上的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效增强了文本编码器对否定的鲁棒性，且适用于大语言模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在符号音乐领域的潜在能力，尤其是其如何通过文本描述隐式建模音乐概念。

Method: 通过文本提示生成符号音乐数据（MIDI文件），并训练神经网络进行风格分类和旋律补全任务。

Result: LLMs能推断出基本的音乐结构和时间关系，但其生成能力受限于缺乏显式音乐上下文。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号音乐生成中显示出潜力，但仍需进一步研究以克服其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

TL;DR: 研究跨语言一致性对评估跨语言迁移性、保持模型知识的跨语言事实性以及语言模型性能一致性的重要性。通过分析代码混合的共指陈述，发现多语言模型在不同语言家族和语言学因素下表现不同的一致性水平，并提出改进策略。

Motivation: 探讨跨语言一致性在多语言模型中的重要性，以评估知识迁移性和模型性能一致性。

Method: 通过代码混合的共指陈述分析跨语言知识一致性，并使用可解释性方法研究模型行为。

Result: 多语言模型在不同语言家族和语言学因素下表现不同的一致性水平，代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐目标表现最佳。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对提升多语言性能和跨语言一致性至关重要。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Result: 实验验证了中间层可以生成合理内容，并在分层文本分类、分类引导生成等任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，从零开始预训练通用的分层推理器是可能的。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

Method: 采用多步骤流程：分析表格内容、选择有用列、生成自然语言指令、转换为代码并执行，结合开源LLM和优化提示。

Result: 在任务中实现了85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过LLM生成代码的多步骤方法有效提升了表格问答任务的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法不一定反映语义相似性，因此需要一种能捕捉文本真实语义内容的方法。

Method: 利用LLM生成的摘要进行对比学习，训练模型以在嵌入空间中定位语义相关的摘要。

Result: 在SciRepEval基准测试中达到同类模型的最优性能，证明了语义聚焦训练的优势。

Conclusion: SemCSE通过语义聚焦训练，显著提升了科学文本嵌入的语义分离能力。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

Conclusion: 该研究旨在填补NLP中自我研究的空白，并为相关领域提供实用工具。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Result: 人口统计因素仅占8%的方差，文本内容是主要因素；生成式AI的简单人口统计提示通常无效。

Conclusion: 内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议比人口统计模拟更可靠，是实现公平的更优路径。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

TL;DR: GEMMAS是一个基于图的评估框架，用于分析多智能体系统的内部协作过程，提出两个过程级指标（IDS和UPR）以衡量协作质量，揭示仅关注最终结果的评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注多智能体系统的最终输出正确性，忽略了低效通信和协调导致的冗余推理和计算成本增加问题。

Method: 提出GEMMAS框架，将智能体交互建模为有向无环图，并引入信息多样性分数（IDS）和不必要路径比率（UPR）两个过程级指标。

Result: 在GSM8K等五个基准测试中，GEMMAS发现准确率仅差2.1%的系统在IDS和UPR上差异显著（12.8%和80%），表明内部协作质量差异巨大。

Conclusion: 仅依赖结果级指标不足以评估多智能体性能，过程级诊断对于设计更可解释和资源高效的协作AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在数据稀缺场景下对未见任务的适应性较差，现有跨任务上下文学习方法在鲁棒性、可扩展性和效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过分析大语言模型潜在空间中的激活模式，提出CAST框架，利用高资源任务的样本增强激活状态，迁移到低资源任务。

Result: 实验表明，CAST在跨领域和跨语言迁移任务中优于基线方法，具有更高的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST框架为跨任务知识迁移提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为QuestA的方法，通过在RL训练中引入部分解决方案来增强多步推理能力，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在训练大型语言模型中被广泛应用，但其在多步推理任务（尤其是复杂问题）上的有效性受到质疑。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出QuestA方法，通过问题增强（引入部分解决方案）来降低问题难度并提供更有信息量的学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，QuestA显著提升了pass@1和pass@k性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: QuestA不仅提升了推理能力，还提供了理论解释，为通过RL扩展推理能力提供了实用且可推广的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TalentCLEF 2025是首个专注于技能和职位标题智能的评估活动，包含多语言职位匹配和基于职位标题的技能预测任务，旨在推动劳动力市场中可靠、公平的语言技术发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在人力资源管理中，语言技术的应用缺乏公开数据和基准测试，阻碍了可靠和公平模型的开发。

Method: 通过构建多语言、多样化的真实数据集，设计两个任务（多语言职位匹配和技能预测），并评估模型的性能和性别偏见。

Result: 吸引了76个团队参与，结果显示训练策略比模型规模更重要，且首次提供了该领域的公开基准。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF为劳动力市场语言技术提供了首个公开基准，促进了稳健、公平和可迁移技术的发展。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

TL;DR: RCPS框架通过深度结构化叙事规划、自适应布局生成和迭代优化循环，显著提升了媒体演示的生成质量。PREVAL评估框架与人类判断高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的演示存在逻辑不一致和布局不佳问题，难以满足专业标准。

Method: 提出RCPS框架，包含深度结构化叙事规划、自适应布局生成和迭代优化循环；引入PREVAL评估框架。

Result: RCPS在内容、连贯性和设计方面显著优于基线方法，PREVAL与人类判断高度相关。

Conclusion: RCPS和PREVAL为高质量媒体演示的生成和评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

TL;DR: AbGen是首个评估LLMs设计科学研究中消融研究能力的基准，包含1500个专家标注示例。评估显示LLMs与人类专家在重要性、忠实性和合理性上存在显著差距，且当前自动评估方法不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估LLMs在科学消融研究设计中的能力，填补现有基准的空白。

Method: 基于807篇NLP论文构建1500个专家标注示例，要求LLMs生成消融研究设计，并开发AbGen-Eval评估自动评估系统的可靠性。

Result: LLMs表现显著低于人类专家，且自动评估方法与人工评估存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 需开发更可靠的LLM评估系统，AbGen-Eval为此提供了研究基础。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了HapticCap数据集，用于匹配用户描述与触觉振动信号，并提出了触觉描述检索任务，通过对比学习框架取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有意义的触觉信号具有挑战性，缺乏大规模标注文本描述的触觉数据集和现有模型描述振动信号的能力有限。

Method: 创建HapticCap数据集（92,070对触觉-文本），提出触觉描述检索任务，采用监督对比学习框架结合T5和AST模型。

Result: T5和AST模型的组合在触觉描述检索任务中表现最佳，尤其是在分类训练时。

Conclusion: HapticCap数据集和提出的方法为触觉信号与文本描述的匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

*Amrit Poudel,Tim Weninger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨搜索引擎如何通过与意识形态驱动的用户查询互动加剧搜索结果偏见，揭示其对公共话语的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索搜索引擎和用户查询如何共同导致搜索结果偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 分析主要搜索引擎在政治和社会话题上的输出数据。

Result: 搜索引擎不仅反映潜在偏见，意识形态驱动的查询还加剧偏见，放大特定叙事，且不同引擎优先来源差异显著。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎通过强化意识形态分歧影响公众认知，加剧信息极化。

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉-语言（VL）训练是否显著改变语言模型的语义表示，发现VL训练主要影响概念分类知识的运用而非知识本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证VL训练是否对语言模型的语义表示产生有意义的影响，尤其是概念分类知识的组织。

Method: 通过比较纯文本语言模型和VL训练模型在文本问答任务中的表现，结合行为与表示分析。

Result: VL模型在需要概念分类理解的问答任务中表现更好，但分类知识本身未显著改变，而是任务中的知识运用方式不同。

Conclusion: VL训练未显著改变语言模型的分类知识，但改进了其在特定任务中的运用能力。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

Motivation: 解决Transformer大语言模型在长度泛化任务中的局限性，追求更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出TAIL方法，通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的链式思维数据，优化推理步骤和数据访问机制。

Result: TAIL显著提升了Qwen2.5-7B模型在多种任务中的长度泛化能力，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 图灵机的关键概念对长度泛化至关重要，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Motivation: LLM的性能高度依赖上下文信息，但现有研究缺乏系统优化方法，需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析1300多篇论文，分解上下文工程的基础组件（检索、生成、处理、管理）及其系统实现（RAG、记忆系统、多代理系统）。

Result: 发现模型在理解复杂上下文方面表现优异，但在生成高质量长文本方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 提出了上下文工程的统一框架，并指出未来需解决生成能力与理解能力的不对称问题。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究多集中于简单双关笑话，而忽略了更复杂的幽默形式。

Method: 构建包含600个笑话的数据集，涵盖4种类型，并手动编写高质量解释，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试的LLMs均无法可靠生成所有笑话类型的充分解释。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算幽默领域对简单笑话形式的过度关注，以及LLMs在复杂幽默解释上的不足。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected

best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D动态场景推理（如自我中心运动后的场景预测）上表现不佳，缺乏对3D动态的内部建模能力。

Method: MindJourney通过VLM迭代生成相机轨迹，世界模型合成对应视图，VLM基于多视图证据进行推理。

Result: 无需微调，MindJourney在空间推理基准SAT上平均提升8%性能，优于基于强化学习的测试时推理VLM。

Conclusion: 结合世界模型的测试时扩展为3D推理提供了一种简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Conclusion: 提出的Mono-InternVL系列通过创新的视觉参数嵌入和预训练策略，显著提升了单模态MLLM的性能和效率，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to

architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI通过编码器阶段的HOI线索预判和新型损失函数，显著提升了HOID任务的性能。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

Result: CogNVS在动态场景新视角合成任务中表现优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: CogNVS通过创新方法显著提升了动态场景新视角合成的效果。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake通过多尺度建模和协同优化机制，显著提升了UMIS的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型依赖任务特定的人类演示，泛化能力有限且数据获取成本高。

Method: 提出ATARA自监督框架加速数据收集，AnyPos模型解决分布不匹配问题，并引入动作验证模块。

Result: 实验显示AnyPos-ATARA管道测试准确率提升51%，下游任务成功率提高30-40%。

Conclusion: 任务无关范式显著提升模型性能，降低数据成本，适用于多样化操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ReToM的局部代表性令牌合并策略，用于优化图像生成模型的注意力机制，提升效率并保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稳定扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但其注意力操作的二次复杂度导致生成过程耗时。现有令牌合并方法未充分考虑图像生成模型的特点，限制了效果。

Method: 提出ReToM策略，通过定义局部窗口边界并调整窗口大小，合并令牌。引入代表性令牌，选择每个窗口中最具代表性的令牌以减少计算开销。

Result: 实验显示ReToM在FID上提升6.2%，CLIP得分更高，同时保持推理时间不变。

Conclusion: ReToM在视觉质量和计算效率之间取得了平衡，适用于任何注意力机制的图像生成模型。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer是一种高效且理论支持的视觉Transformer改进方法。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）主要针对室内场景，无法有效处理户外大规模场景的多视角、多模态数据融合问题。

Method: 构建SVM-City数据集（包含多尺度、多视角、多模态数据），并设计City-VLM模型，通过联合概率分布空间实现多模态融合。

Result: City-VLM在问答任务中平均性能提升18.14%，优于现有LVLMs。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种户外场景中表现出实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Motivation: 现有文档质量评估方法准确性不足，限制了实际应用。MLLMs在图像质量评估中的成功启发了将其扩展到文档领域。

Method: 通过调整DeQA-Score（一种基于MLLM的图像质量评分器），提出DeQA-Doc框架，采用软标签策略和分辨率放宽，并引入集成方法提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，DeQA-Doc在多种退化类型下均显著优于现有基线，提供准确且通用的文档质量评估。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc成功将MLLMs应用于文档质量评估，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sage的新方法，通过语义引导微调基础模型来解决长尾视觉识别问题，同时引入分布不匹配感知补偿因子以纠正预测偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾场景中类别样本量的差异导致低频类别性能下降，现有方法通常忽略视觉与文本模态的对齐。

Method: 提出Sage方法，通过SG-Adapter将类描述作为语义引导融入视觉微调过程，并设计分布不匹配感知补偿因子以纠正预测偏差。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，Sage能有效提升长尾学习性能。

Conclusion: Sage通过增强视觉与文本模态对齐及纠正预测偏差，显著改善了长尾视觉识别的效果。

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

Motivation: 现有VQA方法依赖事件中心标注，缺乏视频的全局上下文信息，限制了模型的泛化和推理能力。

Method: FIQ生成基于视频描述的问题对，并结合VQ-CAlign模块对齐问题嵌入与视觉特征。

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强基础理解提升模型泛化和推理能力。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本CIR方法存在信息丢失或视觉上下文利用不足的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来平衡文本修改和视觉信息。

Method: 提出MCoT-RE框架，利用多角度思维链生成两个描述（修改导向和综合视觉文本上下文），并通过两阶段重排序实现精确检索。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上，Recall@10和Recall@1分别提升了6.24%和8.58%，达到零样本方法的最高水平。

Conclusion: MCoT-RE通过结合多角度思维链和重排序，显著提升了零样本CIR的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉和文本模态融合中存在早期融合过度关注文本细节而忽略视觉上下文，或晚期融合难以捕捉细粒度语义对齐的问题。

Method: FAR-Net采用多阶段融合框架，包括增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）和自适应协调模块（ARM），分别通过晚期融合和早期融合优化模态交互。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上，FAR-Net显著提升了性能，Recall@1和Recall@50分别提高了2.4%和1.04%。

Conclusion: FAR-Net为组合图像检索任务提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to
present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image
captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion,
Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated.
We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image
datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates
potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于学习的单目视觉里程计在鲁棒性、泛化和效率方面的挑战，尤其是DINOv2在VO中应用受限的问题。

Method: 提出了一种针对DINOv2粗粒度特征的关键点检测器，结合几何特征，并使用基于Transformer的匹配器和可微分姿态估计层。

Result: 在TartanAir和KITTI数据集上表现优于现有方法，运行效率高（72 FPS，内存<1GB），在户外驾驶场景中与Visual SLAM系统竞争。

Conclusion: DINO-VO通过结合DINOv2的语义特征和几何特征，显著提升了单目视觉里程计的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRE的注意力重聚焦方法，用于解决CLIP在领域泛化中难以关注任务相关区域的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在领域泛化中表现不佳，因其难以聚焦于跨领域的任务相关区域（即领域不变区域）。

Method: SRE通过模拟领域偏移、注意力重聚焦和集成学习来减少领域差异。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SRE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE通过注意力重聚焦有效提升了CLIP在领域泛化中的性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的视觉语言导航方法受限于固定知识库和推理能力，无法有效融入经验知识，缺乏进化能力。

Method: SE-VLN包含三个核心模块：分层记忆模块（存储成功与失败案例）、检索增强的推理模块（多步决策）和反思模块（持续进化）。

Result: 在R2R和REVERSE数据集上，导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，比现有方法提升23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化代理框架的巨大潜力，其性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在开放词汇预测和跨数据集泛化能力上的不足，适应多样化的地球观测场景。

Method: 提出SCORE框架，结合区域上下文和全局上下文，改进视觉和文本表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上建立了新基准，实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SCORE为大规模地理空间分析提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是开发一种无需数据集特定微调即可在不同分辨率和视差范围内通用的立体匹配模型，解决局部搜索方法全局一致性不足和全局匹配架构计算成本高的问题。

Method: 采用多分辨率变换器进行长距离对应匹配，结合新型损失函数集中概率于可行匹配，实现视差、遮挡和置信度的联合估计。

Result: $S^2M^2$在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中达到最新技术水平，显著优于现有方法，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$通过全局匹配架构和新型训练方法，成功解决了立体匹配中的通用性与效率问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

TL;DR: VITA是一种视觉到动作的流匹配策略，通过将潜在视觉表示转化为潜在动作，简化了传统流匹配和扩散策略的复杂条件机制，提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外的条件机制（如交叉注意力）来将视觉信息与动作生成结合，导致时间和空间开销。VITA旨在消除这些模块，同时保持生成建模能力。

Method: VITA将潜在图像作为流源，通过自动编码器创建结构化的动作潜在空间，并通过流潜在解码监督流匹配，实现端到端学习。

Result: 在ALOHA平台上，VITA在5个模拟和2个真实任务中表现优异，推理延迟降低50-130%，且仅使用MLP层。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅用MLP解决复杂双手操作任务的流匹配策略，简化了架构并提高了性能。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理分割任务中因视觉编码器预训练分辨率低而受限，简单插值位置嵌入效果有限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出HRSeg模型，包含HRP模块（通过裁剪处理高分辨率图像，整合局部和全局特征）和HRE模块（通过高分辨率图像增强掩码特征，优化与文本特征的对齐）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了HRSeg的优越性能，消融实验证明了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的高分辨率感知和增强，显著提升了推理分割任务的性能。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that

we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out

Method: 利用标准高清摄像头捕捉用户眼部外观和头部运动，估计时空注视轨迹，建模注视行为的空间、语义和时间维度。

Result: 揭示了情绪是人与环境互动的复杂结果，而非单纯生理反应，实现了高通用性和低部署成本的无感知实时情绪识别。

Conclusion: 该方法为情绪识别提供了更自然、动态的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道检测在ADAS和ADS中至关重要，但领域迁移会降低模型可靠性。传统方法需要大量标注数据，资源消耗大，因此需要一种无需标签的性能评估方法。

Method: 论文首先将五种图像分类的性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务中，随后提出LanePerf框架，结合图像和车道特征，使用预训练编码器和DeepSets架构处理零车道检测和大领域迁移情况。

Conclusion: LanePerf为ADAS提供了无需标签的鲁棒性能评估方法，支持更高效的测试和提升驾驶场景安全性。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

Conclusion: 新数据集和算法为联邦学习提供了更高效和隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

Conclusion: Argus通过多模态输入有效弥补3D点云重建的信息损失，提升LLMs对3D场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DMQ有效解决扩散模型量化问题，提升资源受限环境下的部署可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding

classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MUPM通过共享预训练和轻量微调实现不确定性关系的量化，为临床任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Result: 实验验证了方法在预测、回溯、插值和多镜头生成等任务中的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LoViC通过统一范式实现了长视频的高效生成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Motivation: 传统DIR框架中正则化参数调优计算成本高，需多次训练迭代，cIDIR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: cIDIR基于INRs，通过训练正则化超参数的先验分布，并利用分割掩模优化超参数，实现连续可微的变形向量场（DVF）。

Result: 在DIR-LAB数据集上评估，cIDIR表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR提供了一种高效且灵活的正则化参数优化方法，适用于DIR任务。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式几何先验，容易产生伪影且难以捕捉细微情感，同时缺乏多角色动画支持。

Result: 实验表明，FantasyPortrait在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法，尤其在跨重演和多角色场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait为面部动画生成提供了高效解决方案，并推动了多角色动画的研究。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Result: 细粒度策略和元数据融合使诊断准确率在有限数据集上提升2%，在更大骨折数据集上提升超10%。

Conclusion: 多模态方法和细粒度策略能有效提升手腕病理诊断的准确性，尤其在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常使用过多视觉令牌，而实际场景中大部分任务无需高分辨率，因此需要一种更高效的压缩方法。

Result: 在OCR任务中表现优异，同时显著节省视觉令牌，实验验证了方法的优越性和高效性。

Conclusion: VisionThink通过自适应压缩策略，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率，为视觉语言模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RGB预训练潜在扩散模型（RGB-LDM）的方法，通过两阶段流程（光谱结构表示学习和光谱-空间联合分布学习）重建高光谱图像（HSI），解决了光谱重建（SR）中不可观测特征的估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光谱重建（SR）需要从RGB图像中重建高光谱图像（HSI），但RGB成像传感器无法捕捉到所有光谱信息，因此需要有效构建光谱-空间联合分布以补充不可观测特征。

Method: 扩展RGB-LDM为不可观测特征LDM（ULDM），通过两阶段流程：1）训练光谱不可观测特征自编码器（SpeUAE）提取和压缩不可观测特征；2）通过SpeUAE和空间自编码器（SpaAE）编码光谱和空间结构，ULDM建模不可观测特征的分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SR和下游重光照任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用RGB预训练模型的空间知识，ULDM专注于建模光谱结构，有效解决了SR问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著减少模型计算和内存需求，适用于资源受限的硬件部署。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Conclusion: DISSect是一种高效且鲁棒的样本选择方法，适用于加速对比学习训练。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: 涂鸦标注监督是一种高效且有效的弱监督形式，显著提升了图像篡改定位的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Result: MaskGIL在ImageNet 256x256上FID达3.71，仅需8步推理，支持文本驱动生成。

Conclusion: MaskGIL不仅性能优越，还能加速AR生成并支持实时语音转图像。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层核心集选择（HCS）机制，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂广域场景理解中的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在适应未见复杂广域场景时面临挑战，需要一种无需额外微调的方法来快速理解场景。

Method: HCS通过理论保证的重要性函数逐步优化区域选择，考虑效用、代表性、鲁棒性和协同性。

Result: 实验表明，HCS在多种任务中表现出卓越的性能和普适性。

Conclusion: HCS是一种即插即用的方法，适用于任何VLM，能够高效理解未见场景。

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在数据集蒸馏中存在标签不一致或结构细节不足的问题，影响下游性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能合成高质量图像，在验证集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了标签不一致和图像质量问题，提升了数据集蒸馏的性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于成本体积的运动特征表示方法，通过减少子网络数量提升效率，在保持精度的同时显著提高实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键的机器人应用中，实时准确检测动态对象至关重要，现有方法因多子网络联合使用导致计算成本高，影响实时性。

Method: 提出Channel-wise Motion Features，仅使用Pose Network提取深度特征和3D运动信息，减少计算负担。

Result: 在KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，FPS提升约4倍，参数减少至25%，同时保持同等精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过简化网络结构，显著提升了运动分割的实时性和效率，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB通过ETOP和TDQI解决了PROB模型中的学习冲突问题，显著提升了开放世界目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）任务中，未知对象的无监督检测和增量学习是主要挑战。PROB模型虽无需伪标签，但存在对象性与类别预测的学习冲突问题。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB，引入ETOP终止对象性预测，并采用TDQI初始化查询，高效提取已知和未知对象特征。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，Decoupled PROB表现优于现有方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过解耦学习冲突和优化查询初始化，成为开放世界目标检测的新标杆。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

TL;DR: DiffOSeg是一个两阶段扩散框架，旨在同时实现共识驱动和偏好驱动的医学图像分割，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释变异性问题严重，传统深度学习方法无法捕捉注释者偏差，现有多注释者方法视角单一。

Method: 提出DiffOSeg框架，第一阶段通过概率共识策略建立群体共识，第二阶段通过自适应提示捕获专家偏好。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和NPC-170数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能同时满足共识和偏好需求，为医学图像分割提供更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Motivation: 现有提示调优方法在少样本场景下易过拟合，且依赖复杂架构和超参数调优，限制了通用性。

Method: 提出GLAD框架，结合LoRA和梯度正则化技术，优化模型参数区域。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上，GLAD在基类到新类泛化、图像域泛化和跨数据集泛化上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLAD是一种简单通用的框架，显著提升了少样本学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 胎儿肺成熟度对预测新生儿结果至关重要，但现有非侵入性评估方法依赖手动分割，耗时且限制临床应用。

Method: 使用3D nnU-Net模型对扩散加权MRI图像进行自动分割，并通过模型拟合评估肺成熟度。

Result: 分割模型平均Dice系数为82.14%，自动与手动分割的IVIM参数无显著差异。

Conclusion: 自动化流程可行，支持胎儿肺成熟度评估和临床决策。

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: R²MoE在持续学习新视觉概念方面表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多原型对齐和关键点引导的聚类，显著提升了3D点云异常检测的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

Conclusion: 多模态方法显著提升了红外小目标检测性能，证明了语言先验的有效性。

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

Result: 在AI-TOD数据集上AP提升4.0%，AP75提升6.5%；在DIOR数据集上也验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity

novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种近似正交微调（AOFT）策略，通过生成近似正交的低秩权重矩阵，提升视觉变换器（ViT）在下游任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到预训练ViT的权重矩阵具有近似正交性，而低秩适应矩阵（如LoRA和Adapter）缺乏这一特性，可能导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AOFT策略，用单个可学习向量生成近似正交的向量，构建低秩投影矩阵，使其与预训练权重矩阵性质一致。

Result: 实验表明，AOFT在多个下游图像分类任务中表现优异，验证了其提升泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: AOFT通过近似正交性优化低秩矩阵，显著提升了ViT在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

TL;DR: DiffClean使用文本引导扩散模型消除化妆痕迹，提高年龄验证和面部识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化妆可能干扰年龄验证和面部识别，需要一种方法来消除化妆的影响。

Method: 提出DiffClean，一种基于文本引导扩散模型的化妆痕迹消除方法。

Result: 在模拟和真实化妆图像上，DiffClean显著提升了年龄验证（4.8%）和面部识别（TMR提升8.9%）的准确性。

Conclusion: DiffClean能有效防御化妆攻击，提升年龄验证和面部识别的性能。

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Conclusion: FashionPose为个性化虚拟时尚展示提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

Conclusion: 改进后的标注促进了姿态感知多模态推理的定量评估和未来发展。

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于实时检测手-物体交互的高效方法，通过级联架构结合动作识别和物体检测模块，在ENIGMA-51基准测试中达到38.52% p-AP的准确率，同时保持30fps的实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手-物体交互检测在实时应用中仍然是一个开放性挑战，直观的用户体验需要快速准确地检测与周围物体的交互。现有方法在实时性和准确性之间难以平衡，特别是在流媒体第一人称视觉场景中。

Method: 提出了一种级联架构方法，包含两个核心模块：1）动作识别模块：使用Mamba模型结合EfficientNetV2作为骨干网络；2）物体检测模块：使用微调的YOLOWorld模型。两个模块按顺序运行，当动作识别预测到接触状态时，激活物体检测模块对相关帧进行推理以检测和分类活跃物体。

Result: 在ENIGMA-51基准测试中，动作识别模块达到38.52% p-AP准确率，运行速度为30fps；物体检测模块（微调YOLOWorld）在手部和物体检测上达到85.13% AP。整个系统能够实现实时处理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了实时手-物体交互检测，通过级联架构有效平衡了准确性和计算效率。当动作识别确认交互时才激活物体检测，这种设计降低了计算负载同时保持了检测准确性，为实时应用中的直观用户体验提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Conclusion: 优化后的DiT模型在移动设备上实现实时高质量视频生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

Conclusion: 滑动迭代去噪有效提升4D一致性，同时控制GPU内存消耗。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex
concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method
significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and

Motivation: 当前3D生成任务中，部件组合生成的需求日益增长，但现有方法在部件级生成和自动组合方面表现不足。

Method: 基于3DShape2VecSet的潜在空间，AutoPartGen通过自回归方式逐个生成部件，并利用输入条件（如图像或3D对象）指导生成过程。

Result: AutoPartGen在3D部件生成任务中达到最先进性能，生成部件可无缝组合成完整对象。

Conclusion: AutoPartGen为3D部件组合生成提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Conclusion: 小批量耦合能够提升层次化流匹配的建模能力，为复杂分布生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Result: 构建了VideoITG-40K数据集，并在多模态视频理解基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: VideoITG展示了在视频理解中的优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1

effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on

Motivation: 当前机器学习过于依赖并行化，但某些问题（如数学推理、物理模拟、序列决策）本质上是串行的，需要新的计算架构。

Method: 通过复杂性理论形式化并行与串行问题的区别，分析现有并行架构的局限性。

Result: 证明并行架构在串行问题上存在根本性限制，需要重新设计模型和硬件。

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

TL;DR: Assay2Mol利用大型语言模型从非结构化的生物化学筛选数据中生成候选药物分子，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物化学筛选数据中的非结构化文本包含丰富信息，但未被充分利用。

Method: Assay2Mol通过检索类似目标的现有筛选记录，并利用上下文学习生成候选分子。

Result: Assay2Mol在生成候选配体分子方面优于现有机器学习方法，且分子更易合成。

Conclusion: Assay2Mol为早期药物发现提供了高效工具，充分利用了现有数据。

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KRC问题的动机在于其在实际应用（如个性化推荐和大规模决策）中的重要性，同时解决传统k均值聚类（KMC）无法直接处理排名向量的局限性。

Method: 论文提出KRCA算法，通过迭代优化初始KMC解，并结合分支定界（BnB）方法提升效率。此外，单簇情况下推导了最优质心的闭式解。

Conclusion: KRC问题在实践中有重要意义，KRCA算法提供了方法上的进步，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了[0,1]值回归问题，提出了一种新的损失函数（betting loss），实现了无需方差知识的方差自适应界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在[0,1]值回归问题中，是否存在一种损失函数能够实现优于一阶界限的方差依赖界限（二阶界限）。

Method: 通过提出一种新的损失函数（betting loss），并分析其在回归问题中的表现。

Result: 证明了betting loss能够实现方差自适应界限，且无需预先知道方差信息。

Conclusion: betting loss在[0,1]值回归问题中表现优异，能够自适应方差，优于传统损失函数。

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种针对元学习任务（贝叶斯超参数优化的热启动）的表格表示学习方法，分别基于深度度量学习和标志重建，但实验表明这些方法虽能学习到与标志对齐的表示，但未必显著提升元任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构表格数据集的表示学习在元学习中仍是一个开放问题，现有方法多为通用表示，本文针对特定元任务（超参数优化热启动）提出定制化方法。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 基于深度度量学习的表示学习；2) 基于标志重建的表示学习。两种方法均旨在捕捉标志属性。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法能有效学习与标志对齐的表示，但在超参数优化热启动任务中性能提升不显著。

Conclusion: 定制化表示学习方法虽能捕捉标志属性，但需进一步优化以显著提升元任务性能。

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

Conclusion: TASKPGM不仅提升性能，还提供任务影响和混合组成的可解释性，是高效微调的有力工具。

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Motivation: 随着LLM在工业规模中的广泛应用，启动开销成为重要问题，尤其是在频繁失败和多团队迭代更新的场景下。论文旨在解决这一被忽视的问题。

Method: 通过分析真实生产数据，量化启动开销的组成部分，并设计Bootseer框架，优化容器镜像加载、运行时依赖安装和模型检查点恢复。

Result: Bootseer在实际部署中减少了50%的启动开销。

Conclusion: 启动开销是LLM训练中的重要瓶颈，Bootseer通过系统级优化显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

Motivation: 探索推理微调模型中回溯行为的底层机制，揭示其与基础模型已有表征的关系。

Method: 通过识别基础模型Llama-3.1-8B残差流中的方向，并用于引导蒸馏推理模型，分析其对回溯行为的影响。

Result: 发现该方向能系统性诱导蒸馏模型回溯行为，且无法通过词级属性简单解释；基础模型本身不受此方向影响。

Conclusion: 推理微调模型通过重新利用基础模型的已有表征形成新行为回路，而非从零学习新能力。

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

Motivation: 神经信号包含敏感信息，数据共享存在隐私挑战，联邦学习作为一种隐私保护框架，尚未在闭环自适应神经接口中应用。

Method: 引入FL-based神经解码，通过高维肌电信号在开放和闭环场景中系统评估其性能与隐私。

Result: 开放环模拟中FL显著优于本地学习，闭环用户研究中需调整FL方法，本地学习性能更优但隐私风险更高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了实时自适应应用中的性能-隐私权衡，需设计专门针对单用户应用的FL方法。

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了PINNs的外推能力，为复杂科学和工程问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited

using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its

Conclusion: LySep框架有效解决了深度学习优化问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in
transforming healthcare through the analysis and modeling of electronic health
records (EHRs). However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and
domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ
fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey
offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of
deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a
unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric
approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal
learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review
representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and
temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with
clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation
models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream
reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability,
clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This
survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR
modeling and clinical decision support. For a comprehensive list of EHR-related

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新三板企业因规模小、财务韧性不足，面临较高的财务风险，需更精准的风险预测方法。

Method: 设计了三通道图同构网络（GIN），分别处理数值、文本和图数据，通过注意力机制和门控单元融合多模态表示。

Conclusion: 该研究为中小企业风险建模提供了理论和实践支持，为监管机构和投资者提供了数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods
and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for
SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and
investors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测面临非平稳性、多尺度周期性和瞬态动态等挑战，现有方法如Transformer和Mamba在效率和捕捉能力上存在不足。

Method: 提出FLDmamba框架，利用傅里叶和拉普拉斯变换捕捉多尺度周期性和瞬态动态，同时增强对数据噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: FLDmamba在时间序列预测基准测试中表现优异，优于Transformer和其他Mamba架构。

Conclusion: FLDmamba为长时预测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型无损压缩器在压缩比、吞吐量和鲁棒性上的不足限制了其在基因组数据库备份、存储和管理中的广泛应用。

Method: 1) 提出自动化多知识学习框架；2) 设计GPU加速的(s,k)-mer编码器；3) 引入数据块分区和逐步模型传递机制；4) 提供单GPU和多GPU两种压缩模式。

Result: PMKLC-S/M在15个真实数据集上相比基线方法，平均压缩比提升高达73.609%和73.480%，吞吐量提升高达3.036倍和10.710倍，且具有最佳鲁棒性和内存效率。

Conclusion: PMKLC-S/M在压缩性能、吞吐量和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法，适用于资源受限设备和复杂应用场景。

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RONOM框架，结合了降阶建模（ROM）和算子学习的优点，解决了传统ROM固定离散化的问题，并通过误差界限和数值实验验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统降阶建模（ROM）因固定离散化而缺乏灵活性的问题，同时弥补神经网络算子在无限维与离散化算子间误差量化不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出RONOM框架，结合ROM的误差界限理论与算子学习的灵活性，通过理论分析和数值实验验证其性能。

Result: RONOM在输入泛化、空间超分辨率和离散化鲁棒性方面表现优于现有神经网络算子，并在时间超分辨率场景中提供新见解。

Conclusion: RONOM框架成功结合了ROM和算子学习的优势，为求解偏微分方程提供了更灵活且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

TL;DR: ReLOAD提出了一种基于随机网络蒸馏（RND）的离线强化学习奖励标注框架，无需手工标注奖励即可生成内在奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习需要显式奖励标注，成本高且难以获取。ReLOAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过训练预测网络模仿目标网络的嵌入，利用预测误差作为奖励信号。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优异，与传统奖励标注方法竞争。

Conclusion: ReLOAD为离线强化学习提供了一种高效且无需手工标注的奖励生成方法。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经切线核（NTK）在训练过程中的特征向量动态行为，特别是在“稳定性边缘”（EoS）现象中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究深入探讨了NTK特征值在EoS中的行为机制，但对特征向量行为的理解仍不足。

Method: 通过实验观察不同架构下NTK特征向量的动态变化，并对两层线性网络进行理论分析。

Result: 发现较大的学习率会使最终NTK的主导特征向量与训练目标更对齐。

Conclusion: 研究增强了对深度学习梯度下降训练动态的理解。

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

### [172] [A Kernel Distribution Closeness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12843)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布接近性测试方法NAMMD，通过结合RKHS范数改进MMD，提高了测试能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DCT方法主要针对一维离散空间，难以处理复杂数据（如图像），且MMD在多分布对评估时信息不足。

Method: 设计了一种新的分布差异度量NAMMD，基于RKHS范数缩放MMD值，并提出了NAMMD-based DCT方法。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，NAMMD-based DCT比MMD-based DCT具有更高的测试能力，且类型I误差有界。

Conclusion: NAMMD不仅适用于DCT，还在两样本测试中表现优于MMD，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无线信号在用户静止状态下进行身份识别的潜力，填补现有依赖运动模式的研究空白。

Method: 使用双分支Transformer架构分别处理CSI的幅度和相位信息，结合预处理（异常值去除、平滑和相位校准）提升信号质量。

Conclusion: 研究表明，CSI扰动具有区分个体的潜力，验证了低成本Wi-Fi硬件在现实场景中实现被动、无设备身份识别的可行性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

Result: iw-SFT在语言模型和连续控制任务中表现优异，例如在AIME 2024数据集上达到66.7%。

Conclusion: iw-SFT是一种简单有效的改进方法，性能接近高级RL算法。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low

propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，机器学习预测的解释质量对用户信任和决策至关重要，但现有解释可能难以理解或信任。

Method: 通过ULER框架，利用人类评分和特征相关性判断来学习拒绝低质量解释的拒绝器。

Result: ULER在多个基准测试和人工标注数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ULER能有效识别和拒绝低质量解释，提升用户对预测的信任和决策质量。

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

TL;DR: Fremer是一种高效深度学习模型，用于云服务中的工作负载预测，优于现有Transformer模型，显著提升效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务中的工作负载预测对自动扩展和调度至关重要，但现有Transformer模型在计算效率上不足，需在频域解决复杂周期性模式。

Method: 提出Fremer模型，专注于频域处理，满足高效性、准确性和多周期性能需求。

Result: Fremer在多个指标上优于SOTA模型（MSE提升5.5%，MAE提升4.7%，SMAPE提升8.6%），并减少参数和计算成本。在Kubernetes测试中，延迟降低18.78%，资源消耗减少2.35%。

Conclusion: Fremer在云服务工作负载预测中表现出色，兼具高效性和实用性，适合大规模应用。

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing

Motivation: 随着机器学习模型复杂度的增加，解释性降低，需要透明化的预测方法。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化与解耦驱动的解释框架为复杂模型提供了更透明和可靠的解释方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA数据存储中的错误需要高效的重建算法。

Method: 预训练语言模型并微调以适应实际错误模式。

Result: TReconLM显著提高了无错误序列的恢复比例。

Conclusion: TReconLM在痕迹重建中表现优异，适用于DNA数据存储。

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种改进DAPO算法的方法，通过混合策略视角提升训练稳定性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准策略梯度方法在稀疏奖励环境下存在不稳定和样本效率低的问题。

Method: 1. 引入预训练的稳定引导策略（$\piphi$）提供离策略经验，调整学习步长；2. 重新利用零奖励样本，通过专家策略增强样本效率。

Result: 理论分析表明，目标函数在强化学习框架内收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: 混合策略框架有效平衡探索与利用，提升了策略优化的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Conclusion: MC$^2$A证明了通用硬件加速的可行性，有助于推广MCMC算法在多样化应用中的使用。

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

TL;DR: ARES是一种新的概率框架，通过仅基于已验证的前提判断每个推理步骤，有效检测并防止LLM推理链中的错误传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM错误检测方法未能有效处理早期错误对下游推理的影响，导致错误传播。

Method: 提出ARES框架，采用归纳方法为每个推理步骤生成细粒度评分，并提供统计保证。

Result: ARES在四个基准测试中表现最佳（Macro-F1 72.1%，提升8.2点），在长推理链中尤其优秀（F1 90.3%，提升27.6点）。

Conclusion: ARES通过防止错误传播，显著提升了LLM推理链的可靠性。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Result: 识别出医疗设备、病理特征等临床相关概念，并通过“steering”部分控制模型生成。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MAIRA-2模型内部概念，为提升模型透明度提供了初步见解。

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Result: 理论分析表明，调整谱系数可调制冗余随机游走的贡献；实验验证了方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为图神经网络中的平滑问题提供了新思路，未来研究方向值得探索。

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法为高精度、自动化的基础设施健康监测提供了潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Conclusion: FedGA有效解决了联邦学习中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

Conclusion: CFR提供了一种基于确定性的数据中心方法，用于评估卫星图像中模式对自然性的相关性。

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms

*Vittorio Cipriani,Valentino Delle Rose,Luca San Mauro,Giovanni Solda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了基于无限图G的假设类的PAC和在线可学习性，其中每个副本是通过对G的顶点进行置换生成的。主要结果表明，有限支持副本的PAC可学习性意味着G的完整同构类型的在线可学习性，并等价于自同构平凡性条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无限图的可学习性，特别是在知道图结构和标签集的情况下，学习图的标记。

Method: 通过分析有限支持置换生成的副本的PAC可学习性，以及与自同构平凡性的等价关系，进一步研究顶点交换的可学习性。

Result: 证明了有限支持副本的PAC可学习性等价于G的在线可学习性，并给出了不可学习图的特征。此外，展示了k顶点置换的可学习性与2顶点置换的可学习性等价。

Conclusion: 通过描述性集合论和可计算性理论工具，将无限图划分为四个复杂性类别，并确定了其复杂性。

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS方法在ViT架构搜索中面临计算资源需求高、设计创新不足的挑战，DASViT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DASViT，一种可微分搜索方法，用于探索ViT架构，突破传统Transformer编码器设计。

Result: DASViT生成的架构在多个数据集上优于ViT-B/16，且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: DASViT为ViT架构搜索提供了一种高效且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Conclusion: MUPAX在生成精确、一致且可理解的解释方面优于现有XAI方法，是迈向可信AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured

outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and
IRL techniques.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公共多模态数据集上优于单模态和多模态基线，提升了EEG情感回归和分类性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为BCI应用提供了潜力，有效解决了EEG学习中的模态和标签不一致问题。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Result: 实验表明NGTM在生成质量上具有竞争力，同时支持细粒度控制和语义解释。

Conclusion: NGTM通过主题级调整实现了图生成的可解释性和可控性，适用于分子设计等领域。

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Inherent Bellman Error（IBE）条件的Spectral Bellman Representation框架，用于强化学习中的表示学习，直接对齐Bellman更新结构，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表示学习方法主要基于模型学习，与强化学习任务不匹配，需要一种更直接对齐Bellman更新的表示学习框架。

Result: 学习到的表示能够结构化探索，提升性能，尤其在困难探索和长时程信用分配任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation为基于值的强化学习提供了一种理论扎实且有效的表示学习路径。

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单调梯度函数在解决最优传输问题的Monge形式中起关键作用，广泛应用于流体动力学和机器人群体控制等领域。Brenier定理表明，唯一的最优映射是凸函数的梯度，即单调梯度映射。

Method: 利用mGradNets直接参数化单调梯度映射空间，并通过最小化基于Monge-Ampère方程的损失函数来学习最优传输映射。

Result: 实验表明，mGradNets的结构偏置有助于学习最优传输映射，并成功应用于机器人群体控制问题。

Conclusion: mGradNets为学习最优传输映射提供了一种有效方法，并在实际应用中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

TL;DR: 提出MoTM方法，利用INRs处理时间序列缺失值填补任务，特别是在域外场景下表现优异。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测任务，而域外缺失值填补任务研究不足。

Method: 结合INRs和ridge regressor，提出MoTM模型，通过混合已见模式适应新时间序列。

Result: 在多种缺失值场景（如块缺失、点缺失、变采样率）中表现出鲁棒的域内外泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoTM为适应性基础填补模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

Result: 比利时和瑞典市场的预测精度分别显著提高22%和9%，且在极端市场条件下同样有效。模型频繁校准对精度至关重要，但计算成本较高。

Conclusion: 研究为欧洲互联电力市场的参与者提供了优化竞价策略的指导，强调了异步数据的使用和模型校准的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

Motivation: 当前排列空间的贝叶斯优化依赖于Mallows核，其复杂度高且显式枚举所有成对比较，限制了效率。

Method: 提出基于排序算法的核函数生成框架，Mallows核被视为冒泡排序的特例，进一步引入合并排序衍生的Merge Kernel，并加入三个轻量级描述符提升鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，Merge Kernel在多个排列优化基准上表现优于Mallows核，提供了更紧凑且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: Merge Kernel为排列空间的贝叶斯优化提供了更高效且紧凑的核函数选择。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会经济指标对政策制定和可持续发展至关重要，但数据稀缺地区（如发展中国家）难以获取准确数据。

Method: 整合多源数据，利用LLM提取特征并分类相关性，结合线性估计和非线性变换。

Result: 在三个不同发展水平国家的实验中，模型优于基线方法，尤其在数据稀缺的低收入国家表现突出。

Conclusion: GeoReg模型为数据稀缺地区提供了一种有效的社会经济指标估计方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过Lipschitz约束训练神经网络，特别是Transformer，以提高其稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对输入和权重扰动高度敏感，导致对抗性攻击、训练发散和过拟合等问题。研究旨在通过Lipschitz约束解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了计算高效的工具来维护范数约束权重矩阵，并尝试在训练中强制执行Lipschitz边界。优化器选择（如从AdamW切换到Muon）对性能有显著影响。

Result: 成功训练了具有Lipschitz边界的Transformer模型，在Shakespeare文本上达到60%验证准确率，但在更大模型上需放宽Lipschitz约束以匹配基线性能。

Conclusion: Lipschitz约束可提高模型稳定性，但需权衡性能与约束强度。优化器选择和权重约束方法的协同设计是关键。

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a
multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that
agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the
behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is
understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by
employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent
version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by
pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price
is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a
unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no
extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that
follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of
agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties
and benchmark it.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的LiDAR模拟方法，通过显式建模传感器特性（如滚动快门、激光功率变化和强度衰减），实现了比现有技术更准确的LiDAR模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LiDAR特定效果（如传感器特性）方面表现不足，需要更精确的模拟方法。

Method: 显式建模传感器特性（滚动快门、激光功率变化、强度衰减），并进行定量和定性比较及消融研究。

Result: 方法在LiDAR模拟准确性上优于现有技术，并展示了高级重模拟能力（如生成高分辨率LiDAR扫描）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LiDAR模拟的准确性，并具备广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用FMs的通用知识和WMs的动态建模能力，解决复杂观察或领域差距下的任务泛化问题。

Result: 在多任务离线视觉控制基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂观察或领域差距场景下。

Conclusion: FOUNDER通过结合FMs和WMs，实现了任务语义的深度捕捉和高效解决。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

TL;DR: ReAL-AD框架通过结合人类认知模型和视觉语言模型，提升自动驾驶的决策层次性和可解释性，显著提高规划准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖固定稀疏轨迹监督，无法模拟人类驾驶的层次推理过程，限制了其适应性和性能。

Method: 提出ReAL-AD框架，包含战略推理注入器、战术推理整合器和分层轨迹解码器，结合视觉语言模型增强情境感知和结构化推理。

Result: 实验表明，该框架将规划准确性和安全性提升30%以上，使自动驾驶更接近人类层次推理。

Conclusion: ReAL-AD通过层次化决策框架和视觉语言模型，显著提升了自动驾驶的适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

Abstract: Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

Motivation: 传统物理稳定性指标（如SSM或ZMP）需要难以实时准确测量的参数，如接触力、地形几何和机器人质心。

Method: 使用IMUnet神经网络从本体感受数据推断稳定性，并通过基于视觉的ArUco跟踪方法生成C3评分作为训练信号。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于农业和太空应用中的移动操作任务，并为感知驱动的可穿越性估计和规划提供了监督机制。

Abstract: Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器无法检测地面障碍物（如电线），限制了移动机器人的导航能力。轻量级视觉神经网络的快速发展为这一问题提供了解决方案。

Method: 提出ASC-SW框架，结合深度相机和轻量级视觉神经网络ASCnet。ASCnet采用MobileNetV2作为主干网络，设计ASCSPP模块提取特征，并引入滑动窗口后处理模块优化识别精度。

Conclusion: ASC-SW框架在推理速度和分割性能之间取得平衡，成功应用于物理机器人平台，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of lightweight visual neural network
architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

Result: 优化步态参数可显著降低能量消耗，提升四足运动的整体效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为四足机器人提供了能量高效的控制策略，可直接应用于商业平台。

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

Result: 在静态和动态对象查询中表现优于现有方法，路径更短且成功率更高。

Conclusion: 系统在动态环境中更具鲁棒性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

Abstract: Though visual and repeat navigation is a convenient solution for mobile robot
self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our
qualitative feature flow-motion mapping indicator. Extensive experiments using
our mobile platform demonstrates that our proposed method is lightweight,
robust, and superior to baselines. The source code has been made public at
https://github.com/wangjks/FFI-VTR to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 结构化记忆系统有效解决了LA-EQA任务中的记忆检索与主动探索问题，为长期机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证了方法的有效性，减少了工程设计的依赖，并能提前评估幻觉。

Conclusion: DEMONSTRATE方法显著降低了对LLMs和工程设计的依赖，提高了任务执行的可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has
demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

Result: 实验表明LaViPlan在OOD条件下提升了情境感知和决策能力。

Conclusion: LaViPlan为自动驾驶VLM提供了一种有效的后训练范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

Result: 实验表明MoCap2GT优于现有方法，显著提升SLAM评估精度。

Conclusion: MoCap2GT为SLAM基准测试提供了更精确的地面真实轨迹生成方法。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to
provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI感知系统在传感器性能退化时可能失效，传统方法难以覆盖所有退化场景，需系统性方法确保安全。

Method: 整合相机噪声因素识别与情境覆盖分析，结合专家意见和操作设计域规范，扩展退化模型。

Result: 提出了一种支持鲁棒性需求制定和完整性评估的框架，特别针对汽车领域的相机退化问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为相机AI感知系统的鲁棒性需求提供了初步解决方案，结合噪声因素与情境覆盖分析。

Abstract: AI-based robots and vehicles are expected to operate safely in complex and
dynamic environments, even in the presence of component degradation. In such
systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了VLN-PE平台，用于在物理机器人环境中评估视觉与语言导航（VLN）方法，揭示了性能下降的原因，并提出了扩展性强的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN研究在机器人运动和控制方面的假设过于理想化，未能反映实际部署的物理挑战，因此需要更真实的评估平台。

Method: 提出VLN-PE平台，支持人形、四足和轮式机器人，评估了多种VLN方法，包括分类模型、扩散模型和基于LLM的路径规划。

Result: 结果显示性能显著下降，原因包括有限的观测空间、光照变化和物理挑战（如碰撞和跌倒）。

Conclusion: VLN-PE为改进跨具身适应性提供了新途径，并鼓励社区重新思考VLN的局限性。

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Abstract: As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于长时间任务，有效提升了机器人信息采集的效率。

Abstract: Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

TL;DR: ZipMPC是一种通过学习压缩且上下文相关的成本函数来模仿长时域MPC行为的方法，提升了控制性能并保持低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MPC在实时系统（如机器人）中因计算负担而只能使用短时域预测的问题，从而优化长期目标并满足约束条件。

Method: 利用可微分MPC和神经网络，通过梯度传播学习模仿长时域MPC行为的成本函数。

Result: 在仿真和真实赛车实验中，ZipMPC表现优于基线方法，完成圈速接近长时域MPC，且能处理训练中未见的场景。

Conclusion: ZipMPC有效平衡了性能与计算成本，适用于复杂环境，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its
application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

Motivation: 尽管学习型6-DOF抓取方法取得进展，但仍难以泛化到不同机械臂和实际场景，因此需要更高效的抓取生成方法。

Method: 提出GraspGen框架，结合DiffusionTransformer和高效判别器，引入新的训练方法，并发布包含5300万抓取数据的模拟数据集。

Conclusion: GraspGen通过扩散过程和高效判别器显著提升了抓取生成能力，适用于多种场景和机械臂。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于隐式脑电反馈的强化学习框架（RLIHF），利用EEG信号（如ErrPs）提供连续反馈，无需用户显式干预，解决了稀疏奖励下的策略学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在稀疏奖励条件下效果不佳，需要复杂的手动设计奖励函数。现有RLHF方法依赖显式反馈，干扰自然交互且增加用户认知负担。

Method: 采用预训练解码器将EEG信号转化为概率奖励，结合稀疏外部奖励进行策略学习，并在MuJoCo环境中通过机械臂任务验证。

Result: 实验表明，基于EEG反馈的智能体性能接近手动设计密集奖励的智能体。

Conclusion: 隐式神经反馈为交互式机器人提供了一种可扩展且与人类对齐的强化学习方法。

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种少样本工具使用技能迁移框架，通过多模态感知（触觉和接近传感器）解决机器人工具操作中的复杂接触识别问题，在仿真中预训练基础策略后用少量真实世界演示进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人工具操作面临挑战，因为需要同时处理机器人-工具和工具-环境两个接触点的复杂交互。虽然触觉和接近传感器能够识别这些复杂接触，但由于真实世界数据有限和仿真到现实的巨大差距，使用这些传感器学习工具操作仍然困难。

Method: 提出少样本工具使用技能迁移框架，使用多模态感知：1）在仿真环境中预训练基础策略以捕获工具使用技能中常见的接触状态；2）用真实世界目标域中收集的人类演示对策略进行微调以缩小域差距；3）结合接近传感器和触觉传感器增强接触状态和环境几何识别。

Result: 在Franka Emika机器人臂上验证了该框架能够用少量演示教授使用不同物理和几何属性工具的表面跟随任务。分析表明机器人通过从预训练策略向微调策略迁移识别工具-环境接触关系的能力来获得新的工具使用技能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了机器人工具操作技能的少样本迁移学习，证明了多模态感知在识别复杂接触状态中的有效性，为机器人学习工具操作提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

Abstract: This work presents a novel co-design strategy that integrates trajectory
planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in

overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous

simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs, leveraging quantization algorithms, have significantly
impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model
sizes for flexible deployment. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition and
audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate
regularization.

Conclusion: 该框架为对抗视听虚假信息提供了有效的解决方案，能够恢复真实音频并定位篡改。

Abstract: Recent advances in voice cloning and lip synchronization models have enabled
Synthesized Audiovisual Forgeries (SAVFs), where both audio and visuals are
manipulated to mimic a target speaker. This significantly increases the risk of
misinformation by making fake content seem real. To address this issue,
existing methods detect or localize manipulations but cannot recover the
authentic audio that conveys the semantic content of the message. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in combating audiovisual misinformation.
In this work, we introduce the task of Authentic Audio Recovery (AAR) and
Tamper Localization in Audio (TLA) from SAVFs and propose a cross-modal
watermarking framework to embed authentic audio into visuals before
manipulation. This enables AAR, TLA, and a robust defense against
misinformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of our
method in AAR and TLA against various manipulations, including voice cloning

Abstract: The rapid advancement of voice deepfake technologies has raised serious
concerns about user audio privacy, as attackers increasingly exploit publicly
available voice data to generate convincing fake audio for malicious purposes
such as identity theft, financial fraud, and misinformation campaigns. While
existing defense methods offer partial protection, they face critical
limitations, including weak adaptability to unseen user data, poor scalability
to long audio, rigid reliance on white-box knowledge, and high computational
and temporal costs during the encryption process. To address these challenges
and defend against personalized voice deepfake threats, we propose Enkidu, a
novel user-oriented privacy-preserving framework that leverages universal
frequential perturbations generated through black-box knowledge and few-shot
training on a small amount of user data. These highly malleable
frequency-domain noise patches enable real-time, lightweight protection with
strong generalization across variable-length audio and robust resistance to
voice deepfake attacks, all while preserving perceptual quality and speech
intelligibility. Notably, Enkidu achieves over 50 to 200 times processing
memory efficiency (as low as 0.004 gigabytes) and 3 to 7000 times runtime
efficiency (real-time coefficient as low as 0.004) compared to six
state-of-the-art countermeasures. Extensive experiments across six mainstream
text-to-speech models and five cutting-edge automated speaker verification
models demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of
Enkidu in defending against both vanilla and adaptive voice deepfake attacks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

Abstract: Structural pests, such as termites, pose a serious threat to wooden
buildings, resulting in significant economic losses due to their hidden and
progressive damage. Traditional detection methods, such as visual inspections
and chemical treatments, are invasive, labor intensive, and ineffective for
early stage infestations. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a non
invasive deep learning based acoustic classification framework for early
termite detection. We aim to develop a robust, scalable model that
distinguishes termite generated acoustic signals from background noise. We
introduce a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network Long Short Term Memory
architecture that captures both spatial and temporal features of termite
activity. Audio data were collected from termite infested and clean wooden
samples. We extracted Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and trained the CNN
LSTM model to classify the signals. Experimental results show high performance,
with 94.5% accuracy, 93.2% precision, and 95.8% recall. Comparative analysis
reveals that the hybrid model outperforms standalone CNN and LSTM
architectures, underscoring its combined strength. Notably, the model yields
low false-negative rates, which is essential for enabling timely intervention.
This research contributes a non invasive, automated solution for early termite
detection, with practical implications for improved pest monitoring, minimized
structural damage, and better decision making by homeowners and pest control
professionals. Future work may integrate IoT for real time alerts and extend
detection to other structural pests.

Result: 声学标记在保留说话人身份方面优于语义标记，自回归方法进一步提升了性能，但离散表示仍不及连续表示。

Conclusion: 离散表示在语音增强中仍有不足，需进一步研究。

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of
real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合对比学习和等变学习的自监督多任务学习架构（MT2），用于音乐信息检索（MIR），通过双类别令牌设计，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对比学习和等变学习在MIR任务中的局限性：前者在标签任务（如乐器识别）表现好，后者在特定任务（如调性估计）表现好但泛化能力差。

Method: 采用Vision Transformer（ViT-1D）架构，配备两个类别令牌，分别优化等变学习（CPSD）和对比学习（NT-Xent）。

Result: MT2在多个任务上优于单类别令牌模型，且通过平均两个令牌进一步提升了性能，参数更少（18倍）且表现优于MERT。

Conclusion: 多类别令牌多任务学习方法在MIR中具有广泛适用性，展示了对比学习和等变学习的互补性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning and equivariant learning are effective methods for
self-supervised learning (SSL) for audio content analysis. Yet, their
application to music information retrieval (MIR) faces a dilemma: the former is
more effective on tagging (e.g., instrument recognition) but less effective on
structured prediction (e.g., tonality estimation); The latter can match
supervised methods on the specific task it is designed for, but it does not
generalize well to other tasks. In this article, we adopt a best-of-both-worlds
approach by training a deep neural network on both kinds of pretext tasks at
once. The proposed new architecture is a Vision Transformer with 1-D
spectrogram patches (ViT-1D), equipped with two class tokens, which are
specialized to different self-supervised pretext tasks but optimized through
the same model: hence the qualification of self-supervised multi-class-token
multitask (MT2). The former class token optimizes cross-power spectral density
(CPSD) for equivariant learning over the circle of fifths, while the latter
optimizes normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy (NT-Xent) for contrastive
learning. MT2 combines the strengths of both pretext tasks and outperforms
consistently both single-class-token ViT-1D models trained with either
contrastive or equivariant learning. Averaging the two class tokens further
improves performance on several tasks, highlighting the complementary nature of
the representations learned by each class token. Furthermore, using the same
single-linear-layer probing method on the features of last layer, MT2
outperforms MERT on all tasks except for beat tracking; achieving this with 18x
fewer parameters thanks to its multitasking capabilities. Our SSL benchmark
demonstrates the versatility of our multi-class-token multitask learning
approach for MIR applications.

Result: SHIELD在多个数据集上显著提升了检测准确率，平均准确率分别达到98.13%、98.58%和99.57%。

Conclusion: SHIELD方法能有效防御生成式反取证攻击，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

Result: 神经网络在不同复杂度和信道配置下均表现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 离线训练的神经网络无需先验信道信息或参数更新，即可在实际应用中实现稳健性能。

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

Conclusion: 该框架在多种生物信号处理中表现出色，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

Conclusion: GpGpU R包为高斯过程提供了高效的GPU实现，适用于大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial
statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because
of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly.
Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and
can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core
software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R
package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is
lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine
learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on
a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process
approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is
investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our
new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R
package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software
by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large
spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing
satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better
predictive accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MTCDR方法依赖领域共享实体或需要大量辅助数据预训练，限制了其在非重叠推荐场景中的应用。

Method: GMC利用语义量化的离散项目标识符作为媒介，训练统一的序列到序列模型，并结合领域感知对比损失和领域特定微调。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明，GMC优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: GMC为多目标跨域推荐提供了一种有效的生成范式解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing
35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and
relevance (0.94).

### [253] [The Generalist Brain Module: Module Repetition in Neural Networks in Light of the Minicolumn Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12473)
*Mia-Katrin Kvalsund,Mikkel Elle Lepperød*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 本文综述了受大脑结构启发的AI架构路径，特别是微柱假说，探讨了重复神经模块的集体智能特性及其在现代AI中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代AI不断发展，但生物大脑在鲁棒性、适应性和效率方面仍具有优势。本文旨在填补将皮质柱与重复神经模块架构联系起来的综述空白。

Method: 通过综合历史、理论和方法论视角，区分了架构重复和参数共享模块重复，并探讨了后者在集体智能中的关键特性。

Result: 重复模块倾向于收敛为通用模块，具有简单、灵活和可扩展的特点，可能解决AI中的能效和鲁棒性问题。

Conclusion: 基于模块重复的架构是一种新兴策略，具有未开发的潜力，可能挑战现代AI的可扩展性、能耗和普及问题。

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the
pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.
This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's
structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as
a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective
intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive
reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural
modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,
theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We
distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and
parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated
across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,
adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module
tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers
capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may
offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy
efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust
embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such
systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are
still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an
emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped
potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a
system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and
functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI
problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

Motivation: 探索在2-球面上寻找Z/2本征函数的可能性，并验证多值神经网络的有效性。

Method: 创建多值前馈深度神经网络，使用JAX库实现，固定分支点或让AI动态调整分支点位置。

Result: 在三种情况下找到Z/2本征函数：固定分支点为四面体和立方体顶点，以及动态调整为压扁四面体顶点。

Conclusion: 多值神经网络成功找到Z/2本征函数，且动态调整分支点的方法展示了AI的灵活性。

Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the
2-sphere. For this we created a multivalued version of a feedforward deep
neural network, and we implemented it using the JAX library. We found Z/2
eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch
points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third
case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it
positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.

Motivation: 探讨算法推荐下短视频对儿童和青少年的潜在危害。

Method: 对4,492个短视频进行多模态特征分析和主题建模。

Result: 不安全视频具有更暗的视觉特征，包含显性和隐性有害内容。

Conclusion: 呼吁加强内容审核、年龄验证和平台监管以保护青少年。

Abstract: The prevalence of short form video platforms, combined with the
ineffectiveness of age verification mechanisms, raises concerns about the
potential harms facing children and teenagers in an algorithm-moderated online
environment. We conducted multimodal feature analysis and thematic topic
modeling of 4,492 short videos recommended to children and teenagers on
Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, collected as a part of an
algorithm auditing experiment. This feature-level and content-level analysis
revealed that unsafe (i.e., problematic, mentally distressing) short videos (a)
possess darker visual features and (b) contain explicitly harmful content and
implicit harm from anxiety-inducing ordinary content. We introduce a useful
framework of online harm (i.e., explicit, implicit, unintended), providing a
unique lens for understanding the dynamic, multifaceted online risks facing
children and teenagers. The findings highlight the importance of protecting
younger audiences in critical developmental stages from both explicit and
implicit risks on social media, calling for nuanced content moderation, age
verification, and platform regulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming
tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注期权期望价值，无法全面评估风险和不确定性，因此需要一种能建模收益条件分布的方法。

Method: 使用分布强化学习（DistRL）和基于分位数的价值函数近似器，对亚洲期权进行定价。

Abstract: We reinterpret and propose a framework for pricing path-dependent financial
derivatives by estimating the full distribution of payoffs using Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL). Unlike traditional methods that focus on

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将足球数据转化为对象中心事件日志的框架，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中对象中心事件日志的数量有限，需要更多研究验证其用途。团队运动数据的增加为对象中心过程挖掘提供了机会。

Method: 开发了一个框架，将足球数据转化为带有空间维度的对象中心事件日志。

Result: 基于真实足球数据生成了对象中心事件日志，并讨论了不同过程表示的结果。

Conclusion: 本文首次展示了足球分析中的对象中心事件日志，未来工作应关注变体分析和过滤技术。

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于超图的框架rel-HNN，用于从关系数据库中捕获细粒度的关系语义，并通过多级表示和并行训练算法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库的扁平化处理对深度学习模型提出了挑战，现有方法（如图神经网络）往往简化了关系结构，忽略了元组内部的关联。

Method: 提出rel-HNN框架，将每个属性-值对建模为节点，每个元组建模为超边，并引入多GPU并行训练算法以提高可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，rel-HNN在分类和回归任务中显著优于现有方法，并行训练实现了最高3.18倍的加速。

Conclusion: rel-HNN通过超图建模和多级表示，有效解决了关系数据的学习问题，并行训练进一步提升了效率。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为量子软件开发工具包（QSDKs）之间的灵活、自动化代码转换工具，以解决跨平台开发的互操作性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算平台的多样性导致不同QSDKs之间的互操作性和跨平台开发困难，传统基于规则的转换工具设计复杂且维护成本高。

Method: 利用LLMs的预训练知识和上下文推理能力，将其作为语言无关的转换工具，实现量子程序在不同QSDK间的功能等价转换。

Result: 该方法无需手动定义转换规则，为量子软件的可移植性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子计算生态系统中智能、通用的代码转换迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined
transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software
portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent,
general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

TL;DR: Kodezi Chronos是一种新型架构，用于自主代码理解、调试和维护，支持超长上下文，显著提升代码可靠性和生产力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成和软件自动化中存在上下文限制和缺乏显式代码结构推理的问题。

Method: 采用多级嵌入内存引擎，结合向量和图索引，实现高效代码检索和推理。

Result: 在真实世界错误检测中提升23%，调试周期减少40%。

Conclusion: Kodezi Chronos标志着向自主、持续优化的软件生态系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow increasingly sophisticated and
pervasive, their application to various Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operations (AIOps) tasks has garnered significant attention. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed
survey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve
outcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between
January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In
RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced
LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the
state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,
and propose promising directions for future exploration.

Method: 使用两种强化学习方法（GRPO和ORPO）对32B模型进行微调，并利用丰富注释的合成数据集。

Result: ORPO在Qiskit HumanEval中达到56.29% Pass@1，GRPO为49%，均优于通用基线；在原始HumanEval中分别为65.90%和63.00%。GRPO在基础任务中表现更好，ORPO在中等任务中更优，但均未解决高级任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI辅助量子编程有明显进步，但在高级任务上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic

graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and
the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this
matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse
directed graphs.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

Motivation: 研究计算效率是否能达到统计问题的信息理论极限，尤其是在平均情况假设下难以基于标准最坏情况假设的问题。

Method: 基于NP-硬性假设，通过PAC学习框架，分析样本复杂度与计算效率的关系，并证明NP-硬性结果适用于非适当学习。

Result: 提出了样本复杂度与计算效率的尖锐权衡，并首次证明了NP-硬性结果适用于非适当学习。

Conclusion: 该研究为计算统计权衡提供了新的理论基础，并首次突破了非适当学习的NP-硬性障碍。

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

### [269] [Differentially Private Conformal Prediction via Quantile Binary Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12497)
*Ogonnaya M. Romanus,Roberto Molinari*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为P-COQS的差分隐私方法，用于解决在不确定性量化方法（如Conformal Prediction）中校准数据集的隐私泄漏问题。该方法通过改进随机二分搜索算法来保证预测集的隐私性，但可能略微低于目标覆盖水平。实验表明，P-COQS在隐私噪声、样本量和显著性水平方面表现优越，并在多个基准数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私方法主要关注训练数据的隐私保护，而较少涉及校准数据集的隐私问题。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种通用的差分隐私方法用于Conformal Prediction。

Method: 提出P-COQS方法，改进随机二分搜索算法以在CP的校准阶段计算差分隐私分位数，从而保证预测集的隐私性。

Result: P-COQS在实验中表现出对隐私噪声的鲁棒性，并在覆盖范围、效率和信息量方面优于现有方法，同时生成更小的预测集。

Conclusion: P-COQS是一种有效的差分隐私方法，适用于Conformal Prediction，能够在保证隐私的同时实现目标覆盖范围。

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage
from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer
approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset
which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal
Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this
direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call
Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts
an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in
the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent
prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with
respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample
calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS
generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming
properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage
guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine
the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the
performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we
empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method
is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current
DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.
Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal
prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy
guarantees in all these experimental settings.

*Yujin Jeong,Ramesh Johari,Dominik Rothenhäusler,Emily Fox*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: RIDER提出了一种动态环境下处理时间分布偏移的优化加权经验风险最小化方法，优于传统加权策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在动态变化环境中因时间分布偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 基于随机分布偏移模型，提出RIDER框架，推导最优加权经验风险最小化方法。

Result: 在Yearbook数据集和Wild-Time基准方法中表现优异，同时在股票市场波动预测和纽约出租车行程预测任务中优于传统加权策略。

Conclusion: RIDER为动态环境中的机器学习模型提供了一种有效的优化方法，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models
trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper
introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which
derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

*Pardha Sai Krishna Ala,Ameya Salvi,Venkat Krovi,Matthias Schmid*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的方法，通过不同损失函数识别噪声特性，用于实时车辆状态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的状态估计需要考虑过程和测量模型的不确定性，但噪声特性通常难以确定，错误的协方差矩阵选择可能导致估计不准确或滤波器发散。

Method: 采用基于学习的方法，结合不同损失函数来识别噪声特性。

Result: 该方法能够有效识别噪声特性，并用于实时车辆状态估计。

Conclusion: 学习方法是解决噪声特性识别问题的有效途径，尤其适用于实时车辆状态估计。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty
surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are
usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the
covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could
impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the
filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a
challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and
difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try
identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm
involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been
utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement
models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions
to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for
real-time vehicle state estimation

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了具有有限阶矩的随机初始化权重的深度神经网络的有限维分布（FDDs），并在Wasserstein-1范数下建立了FDDs与其高斯极限之间的近似边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在随机初始化权重下的有限维分布行为，为理解其统计特性提供理论基础。

Method: 假设激活函数为Lipschitz连续，允许层宽度以任意相对速率增长，推导高斯近似边界。

Result: 在宽度与共同尺度参数n成比例且具有L-1隐藏层的特殊情况下，获得了收敛速率为n^{-(1/6)^{L-1} + ε}。

Conclusion: 论文为深度神经网络的有限维分布提供了高斯近似的理论支持，并给出了具体的收敛速率。

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks
with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically,
we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between
the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and
allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In
the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter
$n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order
$n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

### [273] [Self Balancing Neural Network: A Novel Method to Estimate Average Treatment Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12818)
*Atomsa Gemechu Abdisa,Yingchun Zhou,Yuqi Qiu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“自平衡神经网络”（Sbnet）的新方法，通过平衡网络自动获取伪倾向得分，以解决观察性研究中因混杂变量和工具变量导致的平均处理效应估计偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在观察性研究中，混杂变量和工具变量会影响处理和结果，导致平均处理效应估计偏差。传统方法依赖倾向得分模型，但存在模型误设风险。

Method: 提出Sbnet方法，利用平衡网络自动生成伪倾向得分，并通过前馈神经网络一步估计平均处理效应。还提出了多伪倾向得分框架。

Result: 在模拟实验和真实数据集上，Sbnet表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Sbnet通过自平衡机制有效解决了倾向得分模型误设问题，提升了平均处理效应的估计准确性。

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and
outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

### [274] [Bayesian Modeling and Estimation of Linear Time-Variant Systems using Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12878)
*Yaniv Shulman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的贝叶斯框架，用于从输入输出数据中识别线性时变（LTV）系统，通过将系统响应建模为随机过程，并利用现代机器学习技术进行推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别线性时变系统是一个基础但具有挑战性的不适定逆问题，需要一种能够量化不确定性的方法。

Method: 将系统响应分解为后验均值和随机波动项，利用贝叶斯神经网络和高斯过程进行可扩展的变分推断。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能够从单次噪声观测中稳健推断LTI系统特性，在模拟环境噪声层析问题中优于经典方法，并能成功跟踪连续变化的LTV响应。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态环境中的不确定性感知系统识别提供了一种灵活且稳健的方法。

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了逻辑回归模型中部分缺失输入的预测问题，提出了一种Pattern-by-Pattern（PbP）策略，并比较了多种方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决逻辑回归模型中部分缺失输入预测的挑战，尤其是在参数估计不足以预测部分观测输入的情况下。

Method: 采用Pattern-by-Pattern（PbP）策略，为每种缺失模式学习一个逻辑模型，并与多种方法（如均值插补、MICE.RF.Y等）进行比较。

Result: 理论证明PbP能准确逼近贝叶斯概率；实验显示MICE.RF.Y在小样本中表现最佳，PbP在大样本中表现优异。

Conclusion: 推荐在小样本中使用MICE.RF.Y，大样本中使用PbP，尤其在高斯混合或非线性特征情况下。

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging
task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Aprameyo Chakrabartty,Anish Chakrabarty,Swagatam Das*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化自由的切片分布方法（RASD），通过关系感知投影方向（RAPD）改进SGW距离，解决了计算成本高和方向选择不优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGW距离因非信息性投影方向导致计算成本高且代表性不足，需要更优的切片分布，但优化切片分布本身又带来额外计算负担。

Method: 引入关系感知投影方向（RAPD）捕捉随机向量对的关联性，推导出关系感知切片分布（RASD），并基于此提出RASGW距离及其变种（如IWRASGW）。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，RASGW及其变种在多种对齐任务中表现优于SGW。

Conclusion: RASGW通过优化自由的切片分布，显著提升了计算效率和距离的表示能力。

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了COVID-19在塞浦路斯的预测模型，结合流行病学数据、疫苗接种记录、政策措施和天气条件，旨在提升未来疫情应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行对全球健康、经济和社会造成深远影响，大量数据为研究疾病动态和干预措施提供了机会。

Method: 利用塞浦路斯两年的数据集，整合多源数据，分析感染趋势和外部因素对疾病动态的影响。

Result: 研究提供了改进的预测模型，有助于提升疫情准备和应对策略。

Conclusion: 通过分析COVID-19数据，可以为未来疫情提供更有效的预测和应对方案。

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health,
economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights
gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

Conclusion: NLI4VolVis提升了体积数据探索的易用性和可访问性，推荐读者查看案例研究和演示视频。

Abstract: Traditional volume visualization (VolVis) methods, like direct volume
rendering, suffer from rigid transfer function designs and high computational
costs. Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency,
they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for
semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an
interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric
scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic
segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic
components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model
architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user
intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and
declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D
editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene
editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system
through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility
and usability in volumetric data exploration. We strongly recommend readers

Abstract: Cybernetic avatars (CAs) are key components of an avatar-symbiotic society,
enabling individuals to overcome physical limitations through virtual agents
and robotic assistants. While semi-autonomous CAs intermittently require human
teleoperation and supervision, the deployment of fully autonomous CAs remains a
challenge. This study evaluates public perception and potential social impacts
of fully autonomous CAs for physical support in daily life. To this end, we
conducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day
public event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside
semi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we
analyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including
a subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and
shared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The
survey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and
at work. However, concerns were raised regarding task execution reliability. In
contrast, cost and human-like interaction were not dominant concerns. Project

Abstract: The advancement and maturity of large language models (LLMs) and robotics
have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in
the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on
either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent
virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication
remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in
Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between
physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent
communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic
explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the
RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to
the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,
clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work
constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication
gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and
therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient
experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle
with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly
reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,
quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims
to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the
performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary
classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of
noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness
of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can
transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for
biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on
advancing healthcare technology.

Motivation: 量子噪声是现代量子设备的显著问题，导致训练性能不足，需要解决量子联邦学习中的噪声异质性。

Method: 提出SpoQFL框架，利用零星学习动态调整训练策略以适应噪声波动。

Result: 实验表明，SpoQFL在真实数据集上显著优于传统方法，训练性能和收敛稳定性更优。

Conclusion: SpoQFL有效解决了量子噪声异质性问题，提升了量子联邦学习的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and
sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training
performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

### [285] [Coarse Addition and the St. Petersburg Paradox: A Heuristic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12475)
*Takashi Izumo*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于粗粒度加法的新方法，通过将数值分组为感知类别来解决圣彼得堡悖论，展示了其如何在有限认知精度下处理无限期望值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 圣彼得堡悖论揭示了传统决策理论在无限期望值问题上的局限性，现有解决方案依赖于不切实际的数学假设，未能反映人类实际认知过程。

Method: 采用粗粒度加法，将数值分组为感知类别，并用代表元素替代原始值进行加法运算，实现惯性稳定化。

Result: 研究表明，圣彼得堡级数在合适的粗粒度划分下可实现惯性稳定化，为有限认知精度下的决策提供了一种可行模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为圣彼得堡悖论提供了一种新的解释框架，还在行为建模和机器推理领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用地球扁率引起的J2摄动效应，优化CubeSat轨道插入的方法，显著减少燃料消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CubeSat推进能力和燃料储备有限，需要更高效的机动技术以确保任务成功。

Method: 利用J2摄动的长期效应，被动影响轨道参数，减少推进修正需求。

Result: 数值模拟和案例研究表明，该方法能显著降低燃料消耗，提高轨道插入精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为燃料受限的CubeSat任务提供了可行解决方案，有望延长其运行寿命和能力。

Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,
primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel
reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital
corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient
maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a
maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the
Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it
is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument
of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the
need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to
optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required
for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for
fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through
comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital
conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving
accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption
compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this
approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering
a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

assesses ResNet-50 and EfficientNetV2L models for multi-class classification
using DermaMNIST, employing transfer learning and various layer configurations.
One configuration achieves results that match or surpass existing methods. This
study suggests that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can drive progress in
biomedical image analysis, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对虚拟染色评估的新FR-IQA指标PaPIS，结合深度学习和病理学特征，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如FR-IQA指标）无法捕捉病理相关特征，专家评审又耗时且主观。

Method: 开发了PaPIS指标，结合深度学习特征和Retinex分解，更贴合病理学感知质量。

Result: PaPIS能更准确反映病理视觉线索，提升虚拟染色模型的性能。

Conclusion: 病理感知评估框架对虚拟染色技术的发展至关重要。

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation
frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual
staining technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）因缺乏参考图像和主观标注数据有限而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖大规模预训练数据集。

Method: 构建自定义数据集，结合内容和质量特征，采用对比三元组学习方法训练模型。

Result: 模型在少量样本下实现高效训练，并在公开数据集上表现出强泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为NR-IQA领域提供了新的解决方案，减少了数据依赖并提升了性能。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent
complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Motivation: 解决健康组织修复中DDPMs采样速度慢的问题，以支持肿瘤生长模型和图像配准。

Method: 采用方差保持噪声调度和特定重建损失，结合3D小波扩散模型（WDM3D），无需对抗训练。

Result: fastWDM3D在BraTS测试集上SSIM为0.8571，MSE为0.0079，PSNR为22.26，仅需2个时间步，速度提升800倍。

Conclusion: fastWDM3D是一种快速且准确的健康组织修复方法，性能优于其他DDPMs。

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率高光谱图像（HSI）在遥感和医学成像中至关重要，但现有方法通常需要不切实际的校准或真实数据。

Method: SpectraLift利用多光谱图像的光谱响应函数（SRF），通过轻量级多层感知机（MLP）网络，自监督地训练模型，优化光谱重建损失。

Result: SpectraLift在PSNR、SAM、SSIM和RMSE等指标上优于现有方法，且收敛速度快。

Conclusion: SpectraLift提供了一种高效、自监督的高光谱图像融合方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了模型，展示了BAoII对系统性能评估的影响，并揭示了通信成本与信息新鲜度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: BAoII为元宇宙和数字孪生中的实时协作提供了重要性能指标，优化了信息更新策略。

Abstract: Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins
(DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their
characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these
representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and
system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect
information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent
penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about
itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of
age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange,
capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own
representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities
share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model,
we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a
transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a
trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our
model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on
evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time
collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.

Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护的道路条件分类系统中具有潜力，但其协作性引入了标签翻转攻击的漏洞，可能导致严重的安全风险。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于标签距离的风险度量方法，并设计了FLARE防御机制，通过神经元层面的分析减轻攻击影响。

Result: 实验表明标签翻转攻击对系统影响严重，而FLARE能有效缓解攻击效果。

Conclusion: 论文填补了联邦学习在道路条件分类系统中标签翻转攻击的研究空白，并提供了有效的防御方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文分析了Prompt Injection 2.0攻击，探讨其如何结合传统网络安全漏洞（如XSS、CSRF）绕过安全措施，并提出结合提示隔离和运行时安全的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理系统的普及，提示注入攻击与网络安全漏洞结合形成混合威胁，传统安全措施失效，亟需新解决方案。

Method: 基于Preamble的研究，评估现有缓解技术对AI蠕虫、多代理感染等威胁的效果，并提出结合提示隔离和运行时安全的架构。

Result: 传统防火墙、XSS过滤器和CSRF令牌对AI增强攻击无效，新架构能有效检测和防御混合威胁。

Conclusion: 提示注入攻击威胁升级，需结合新型检测能力和安全架构以应对AI与网络安全的混合挑战。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which
generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here,
we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the
$\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the
choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank
tensor completion problems.

Conclusion: 论文为无监督度量学习提供了新的算法和建模思路，扩展了距离选择的可能性。

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

### [302] [Stochastic Weakly Convex Optimization Under Heavy-Tailed Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13283)
*Tianxi Zhu,Yi Xu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文研究了在重尾梯度噪声下随机一阶方法（SFOMs）的收敛性，重点关注子威布尔噪声和p-BCM噪声，分析了弱凸目标下的高概率和期望收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型中观察到重尾梯度噪声，但弱凸目标下的SFOMs收敛性研究尚不完整。

Method: 分析了子威布尔噪声下的普通随机次梯度下降（SsGD）和p-BCM噪声下的裁剪SsGD。

Result: 子威布尔噪声下SsGD的收敛性不劣于平滑目标；p-BCM噪声下裁剪SsGD的收敛性不受非平滑性和非凸性影响，但样本复杂度较差。

Conclusion: 弱凸目标下SFOMs的收敛性在重尾噪声下仍保持良好，但p-BCM噪声下的样本复杂度需进一步优化。

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在3D场景重建中表现优异，但在复杂场景中仍存在结构不完整和局部光照效果不清晰的问题。本文提出一种解耦优化框架，结合小波分解，分别优化高低频分量，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DGS方法在复杂场景重建中全局结构不完整和局部光照效果不清晰的问题。

Method: 提出一种解耦优化框架，通过3D小波分解将点云分为高低频分量，分别优化；低分量捕捉全局结构，高分量恢复细节并加入重光照模块；同时对训练图像进行2D小波分解以指导细节重建。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D场景重建的质量和效率，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction,
which effectively balances rendering quality, efficiency, and speed. However,
existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face
significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as
incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To
address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization
framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting
and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach
divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling
targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global
structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through
voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate
geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate
lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D
wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance
variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail
reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global
structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing
existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法在广泛场景下展现了强大的泛化能力和高效性。

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

Motivation: 传统DFT计算在光伏材料筛选中资源消耗大，ML模型能显著减少计算成本和碳排放，但需权衡预测准确性。

Method: 通过逐步用ML替代DFT工作流的组件，量化不同策略的CO₂排放，评估预测效果与环境成本的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为构建低排放、高通量的材料发现流程提供了量化框架，强调了数据驱动方法的实用性和一致性。

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental
efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.

Method: 提出使用形式化查询语言表达用户意图，并通过符号解释器验证LLM生成的代码是否符合意图。在Ansible语言中实现系统Astrogator。

Result: 在21个代码生成任务中，验证器能验证83%的正确代码，并识别92%的错误代码。

Conclusion: 形式化验证方法显著提升了LLM生成代码的可靠性，为自然语言编程提供了可能。

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

Result: 开发了一种适用于任意聚合度的CG势能，在保持CGMD效率的同时接近AAMD的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性之间架起桥梁，有望加速分子发现。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies
specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained
mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization
methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any
degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.
Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and
cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological
domains.

Abstract: A simple, interpretable way to perform automatic drum transcription is by
factoring the magnitude spectrogram of a recorded musical piece using a
partially fixed nonnegative matrix factorization. There are two natural ways to
optimize the nonnegative matrix factorization, including a multiplicative
update rule and projected gradient descent with momentum. The methods differ in
their empirical accuracies and theoretical convergence guarantees. This paper
summarizes the methods and their time complexities, and it applies the methods
to the ENST-Drums data set and an original recording from the author's band,
evaluating the empirical accuracy with respect to ground-truth drum
annotations. The results indicate that projected gradient descent with momentum
leads to higher accuracy for a fixed runtime, and it satisfies stronger
convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Songs, as a central form of musical art, exemplify the richness of human
intelligence and creativity. While recent advances in generative modeling have
enabled notable progress in long-form song generation, current systems for
full-length song synthesis still face major challenges, including data
imbalance, insufficient controllability, and inconsistent musical quality.
DiffRhythm, a pioneering diffusion-based model, advanced the field by
generating full-length songs with expressive vocals and accompaniment. However,
its performance was constrained by an unbalanced model training dataset and
limited controllability over musical style, resulting in noticeable quality
disparities and restricted creative flexibility. To address these limitations,
we propose DiffRhythm+, an enhanced diffusion-based framework for controllable
and flexible full-length song generation. DiffRhythm+ leverages a substantially
expanded and balanced training dataset to mitigate issues such as repetition
and omission of lyrics, while also fostering the emergence of richer musical
skills and expressiveness. The framework introduces a multi-modal style
conditioning strategy, enabling users to precisely specify musical styles
through both descriptive text and reference audio, thereby significantly
enhancing creative control and diversity. We further introduce direct
performance optimization aligned with user preferences, guiding the model
toward consistently preferred outputs across evaluation metrics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DiffRhythm+ achieves significant improvements in
naturalness, arrangement complexity, and listener satisfaction over previous
systems.

Abstract: Separating target speech from mixed signals containing flexible speaker

strong separation performance and noise robustness, they predominantly assume
prior knowledge of speaker counts in mixtures. The limited research addressing

challenges, this paper proposes AVFSNet -- an audio-visual speech separation
model integrating multi-scale encoding and parallel architecture -- jointly
optimized for speaker counting and multi-speaker separation tasks. The model
independently separates each speaker in parallel while enhancing environmental
noise adaptability through visual information integration. Comprehensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that AVFSNet achieves state-of-the-art
results across multiple evaluation metrics and delivers outstanding performance
on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

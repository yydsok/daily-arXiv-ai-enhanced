This paper\ninvestigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated\nprocess modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model\nfrom a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)\nprovides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes\nfollow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong\npre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to\ncreate scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the\nLLM's background knowledge.

To address this\nissue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel\nefficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and\ndynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation\nand a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In\ndynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting\nnetwork to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After\nfine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically\nfeasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be\ndirectly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We\nconduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size\nhumanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed framework."}

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and\ntheir assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,\nwhich this paper does not address."}

Because our\nactuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and\n1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues\nharmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of\nthe human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the\nadvancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive\ntreatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented\nfunctionalities."}

While originally proposed for the language data,\nthey quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities\nwith various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the\nattention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales\nfrom potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to\nincorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based\non ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar\nproblems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in\nthis paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a\nmathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then\nmathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct\nfrom the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived\nformulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard\nSoftmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the\nhierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an\nefficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived\nattention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the\nproposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train\ntransformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it\ncan also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained\ntransformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in\nzero-shot manner."}

Thus, the inability to identify\nuninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To\naddress this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses\nnavigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering\ntokens into foreground and background.

Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains,\nbut existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the\nneed for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous\nrobots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer\ncommunication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart\ncontracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in\ndecentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can\nflexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote\nlocations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates\nrobots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party\nbiases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the\nsecure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a\nByzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different\nstakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality\nthan the estimates of individual robots.

However, existing pruning-based approaches\noften fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters\nresponsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of\nfine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior\nperformance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater\ninterpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \\emph{selection} mechanism\nto identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an\n\\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two\ncomplementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through\nthe inverse mask.

The inner\nproblem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer\nproblem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing\nclean-task accuracy.

The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions\nwith a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable\nalignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we\npropose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a\nfine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce\noverfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting\nto set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves\nphotorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and\nmulti-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly\nacross different datasets."}

In reality, however, there are many acoustic scenarios\nwhere such assumptions are violated. This paper proposes a generalization of\nthe conventional SRP method that allows to apply generic acoustic models for\nlocalization with arbitrary microphone constellations. These models may\nconsider, for instance, level differences in distributed microphones, the\ndirectivity of sources and receivers, or acoustic shadowing effects. Moreover,\nalso measured acoustic transfer functions may be applied as acoustic model. We\nshow that the delay-and-sum beamforming of the conventional SRP is not optimal\nfor localization with generic acoustic models. To this end, we propose a\ngeneralized SRP beamforming criterion that considers generic acoustic models\nand spatially correlated noise, and derive an optimal SRP beamformer.\nFurthermore, we propose and analyze appropriate frequency weightings.

We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the\npresence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in\nproximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common\nsensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor\nplacement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a\nradius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm\nand localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to\nreasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to\nobject type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors\non performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has\npotential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe\nhuman-robot interaction."}

Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size.

We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet.

The system has a\ncompact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote\nmodel, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For\neach sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference.\nBased on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the\nremote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between\nclassification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical\ninference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning\nframework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's\nconfidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model\nand whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We\npresent a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is\ncalibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce\nH2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it\nachieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and\nlearns in the inference phase using limited feedback.

The policy also\ndemonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to\nmismatched classifiers."}

Additionally,\nheats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.\nThese temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments\nthrough mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks\nare designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency\nvariations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer\ncritical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,\nhigh/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series\noperators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot\nbe detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they\nignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning\nframework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically,\nThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules\ntargeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature\nfluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based\non real-time GPU temperature."}

However, existing COD\nbenchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for\nmultispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD\nfeatures three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It\ncaptures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme\nlighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world\nscenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better\nreflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:\nEach image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding\nchallenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on\nMCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.\nNotably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this\ndegradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing\ndetection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for\nfuture research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is\npublicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD."}

Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation.

Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective\ntemporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection\ndetection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.\nSecondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm\nwith a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models\nto leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our\nproposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench\ncompared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while\nenabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B\nparameter alternatives."}

We develop two complementary\nuncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood\nof demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation\nby statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that\nmake binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,\nuncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance\nduring training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves\nremarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming\nexisting approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining\nrobustness to demonstration quality and quantity.

These\nmodels include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and\nlong-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas).\nHowever, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each\nvisual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would\nroughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important\narchitectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we\npresent how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN\nframework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in\nrelation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main\narchitectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2)\nseparation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN\nusing weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom\nloss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights.

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified\nprinciple address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and\nfoster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.

Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the\ndevelopment of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal\nloss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking\ninto account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The\nproposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal\nloss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for\nproper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust\nfoundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are\ndifficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility,\naddressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability\nby dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert\nand non-expert annotations.

We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated\noptimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle\nand significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad\nrange of sizes.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ\nsegmentation.

Experimental\nvalidation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other\nrecent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\\% and a HD\nof 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs.

The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost\nminimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct\nnotions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first\ncarry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps:\ncyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps.

In parallel, we formulate\ncounterfactual reasoning within the framework of structural causal models as a\nproblem of selecting transport maps between fixed marginals, which makes\nexplicit the role of untestable assumptions in counterfactual reasoning.

Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer."}

### [1] [Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844)
*Christopher Wissuchek,Patrick Zschech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分类和比较自主AI系统的框架，通过八个维度定义其认知和环境代理能力，并采用多阶段方法构建和验证该分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对自主AI系统进行分类和比较的结构化框架，阻碍了对AI代理能力的系统评估和未来发展预测。

Method: 采用多阶段方法论构建和验证AI代理能力的分类法，并通过人机混合方法评估。

Result: 提出了一个包含八个维度的分类法，能够分析AI系统的不同代理能力水平。

Conclusion: 该分类法为评估当前AI系统和预测未来自主AI发展提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

### [2] [Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181)
*Zhiyuan Han,Beier Zhu,Yanlong Xu,Peipei Song,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出CA-MER基准测试和MoSEAR框架，解决多模态情感推理中情感冲突问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态情感推理中忽视情感冲突场景，导致对音频信号过度依赖。

Method: 提出MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE模块（减少模态偏见的微调头）和AR模块（推理时重新平衡模态贡献）。

Result: MoSEAR在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在模态冲突条件下。

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效解决情感冲突问题，提升模型性能且不牺牲模态平衡。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

### [3] [A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入一个数学上严谨且统一的‘状态’概念框架，强化了多样化系统的理论基础，包括智能的公理化定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，‘状态’概念缺乏共识和形式化清晰度，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出‘分层状态网格’和‘中间元宇宙’概念，构建一个元形式逻辑框架，避免自引用和逻辑不一致。

Result: 扩展了跨数学、语言和代理的通用理论，提供了一个适用于智能定义和科学理论的数学基础。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个统一的元形式逻辑框架，为智能定义和科学理论提供了数学支持。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

### [4] [AgentTTS: Large Language Model Agent for Test-time Compute-optimal Scaling Strategy in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00890)
*Fali Wang,Hui Liu,Zhenwei Dai,Jingying Zeng,Zhiwei Zhang,Zongyu Wu,Chen Luo,Zhen Li,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究多阶段复杂任务中的测试时计算最优缩放问题，提出AgentTTS框架，通过迭代反馈自主搜索最优模型和预算分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放研究主要针对单阶段任务，而现实问题多为多阶段复杂任务，需解决模型和预算分配的优化问题。

Method: 通过大量实验总结三个经验性见解，提出基于LLM代理的AgentTTS框架，自主搜索最优分配。

Result: AgentTTS在搜索效率和鲁棒性上显著优于传统方法和其他基于LLM的基线。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为解决多阶段任务中的计算最优缩放问题提供了高效且可解释的方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [5] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种模糊框架ff4ERA，用于量化伦理风险评估（ERA），结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法和确定性因子，生成伦理风险评分（ERS），以支持AI系统的伦理决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI（SAI）的发展，伦理风险增加，传统ERA方法因不确定性和模糊性受限，需灵活透明的框架支持伦理决策。

Method: 提出ff4ERA框架，整合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因子（CF），通过ERS量化伦理风险。

Result: 案例研究表明ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感的伦理风险评分，结果稳健且可解释，支持假设分析和设计校准。

Conclusion: ff4ERA为伦理决策提供了可追溯、风险感知的评估工具，适用于复杂的人机协作场景。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

### [6] [An analysis of AI Decision under Risk: Prospect theory emerges in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00902)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文测试了大型语言模型在风险决策中是否表现出与人类相似的‘前景理论’行为，发现模型与人类类似，且情境（如军事与民用）对风险偏好的影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否像人类一样在风险决策中遵循前景理论，并探讨情境对风险偏好的影响。

Method: 通过实验测试大型语言模型在不同情境（如军事与民用）下的风险决策行为，分析其与前景理论的一致性。

Result: 模型在风险决策中表现出与人类相似的前景理论行为，且情境（如军事场景）对风险偏好的影响更大。

Conclusion: 语言模型捕捉了人类的启发式与偏见，但偏见分布不均；情境（‘框架’）对风险偏好的影响比简单的得失更复杂。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

### [7] [Knowledge Editing for Multi-Hop Question Answering Using Semantic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00914)
*Dominic Simon,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CHECK是一种基于语义分析的知识编辑框架，用于改进大型语言模型在多跳问答任务中的表现，通过逻辑优化和重新提示提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在处理需要组合推理的任务（如多跳问答）时表现不佳，导致推理过程不逻辑。

Method: CHECK通过语义分析推理链，修正语义错误，并通过逻辑优化和高温重新提示确保一致性。

Result: 在四个数据集上，CHECK比五种最先进框架平均提高了22.8%的多跳问答准确率。

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

### [8] [Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01956)
*Jiayi Wang,Jacqueline Jil Vallon,Neil Panjwani,Xi Ling,Sushmita Vij,Sandy Srinivas,John Leppert,Mark K. Buyyounouski,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SNOW是一种基于大型语言模型的多模块系统，能自动从非结构化临床笔记中提取特征，性能接近人工方法，且无需临床专家参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记具有丰富信息，但提取有效特征仍具挑战性。现有方法要么依赖人工，要么缺乏可解释性。

Method: SNOW采用模块化多代理系统，利用大型语言模型自动完成特征发现、提取、验证等步骤。

Result: SNOW在预测前列腺癌复发任务中表现接近人工方法（AUC-ROC:0.761 vs 0.771），显著优于基线和其他自动化方法。

Conclusion: SNOW证明自主LLM系统可规模化复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

communication, and real-time scene reconstruction. The framework enables
efficient multi-agent 3D/4D scene synthesis through federated learning of
shared diffusion model and YOLOv12 lightweight semantic extraction and local
NeRF updates while maintaining privacy and scalability. The framework redesigns
generative diffusion models for joint scene reconstruction, and improves
cooperative scene understanding, while adding semantic-aware compression
protocols. The approach can be validated through simulations and potential
real-world deployment on drone testbeds, positioning it as a disruptive
advancement in multi-agent AI for autonomous systems.

### [10] [A Survey on AgentOps: Categorization, Challenges, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02121)
*Zexin Wang,Jingjing Li,Quan Zhou,Haotian Si,Yuanhao Liu,Jianhui Li,Gaogang Xie,Fei Sun,Dan Pei,Changhua Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AgentOps的全面运维框架，用于解决LLM代理系统中的异常问题，包括监控、异常检测、根因分析和解决四个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理系统的广泛应用，其异常问题导致系统不稳定和不安全，亟需系统化的运维方法。当前相关研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 系统定义代理系统中的异常，分为内部代理异常和代理间异常，并提出AgentOps框架，包含监控、异常检测、根因分析和解决四个阶段。

Result: 提出了AgentOps框架，为代理系统的运维提供了系统化的解决方案。

Conclusion: AgentOps框架为代理系统的运维提供了清晰的方向，有助于推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

*Yiyi Lu,Hoi Ian Au,Junyao Zhang,Jingyu Pan,Yiting Wang,Ang Li,Jianyi Zhang,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEDA是一个用于EDA自动化的框架，通过并行学习和结构化提示工程减少微调需求，提高脚本质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代EDA工作流依赖手动脚本和工具特定交互，限制了可扩展性和效率。现有LLM解决方案需要昂贵微调且缺乏标准化框架。

Method: AutoEDA利用Model Context Protocol（MCP）实现标准化自然语言交互，通过智能参数提取和任务分解减少微调需求，并使用扩展的CodeBLEU指标评估脚本质量。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoEDA在自动化准确性、效率和脚本质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoEDA开源发布，支持可重复性和EDA社区发展。

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.
AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA
community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CAD代码生成方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了CAD设计的易用性和效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

### [13] [REACT: A Real-Time Edge-AI Based V2X Framework for Accident Avoidance in Autonomous Driving System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01057)
*Fengze Yang,Bo Yu,Yang Zhou,Xuewen Luo,Zhengzhong Tu,Chenxi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REACT是一个基于轻量级VLM的实时V2X轨迹优化框架，通过多模态输入和边缘适应策略显著减少碰撞率并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类错误导致的多车碰撞频发，需要自动驾驶系统通过V2X通信扩展感知能力，但现有方法存在泛化性差、推理浅层和单模态输入依赖等问题。

Method: REACT结合轻量级VLM和多模块处理多模态输入，优化风险感知轨迹，并通过边缘适应策略降低模型复杂度。

Result: 在DeepAccident基准测试中，REACT碰撞率降低77%，VPQ达48.2%，推理延迟0.57秒。

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM在实时边缘协作规划中可行，语言引导的上下文推理可提升自动驾驶的安全性和响应能力。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: gpuRDF2vec是一个开源库，利用GPU和多节点执行加速RDF2vec流程，显著提升知识图谱嵌入生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识图谱嵌入生成效率低下的问题。

Method: 利用GPU和多节点执行优化RDF2vec流程，包括游走提取和嵌入训练。

Result: 在合成图和真实基准测试中，gpuRDF2vec显著快于现有最快方案jRDF2vec，且游走提取阶段表现优异。

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec为大规模知识图谱嵌入生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: 探索AI代理在电商环境中的购物行为及其对市场的影响，为未来AI主导的电商生态提供洞察。

Method: 开发ACES沙盒环境，结合VLM代理和可编程模拟市场，通过随机化产品参数进行因果分析。

Result: AI代理的购物行为存在显著异质性，对位置、赞助标签和平台背书敏感，卖家策略可显著影响市场份额。

Conclusion: AI代理的购物行为揭示了电商生态的新挑战和机遇，涉及卖家策略、平台设计和监管问题。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Motivation: 生成式AI的输出可能突然从正确转为错误，导致巨大损失甚至死亡，亟需揭示其内在机制以提高透明度和可控性。

Method: 通过数学映射到多自旋热系统，揭示了AI基本注意力头的临界点，并推导了临界点的精确公式。

Result: 发现AI输出存在隐藏的临界点，其多层架构会放大这种突变，公式量化了用户提示和训练偏差的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为提升AI透明性和性能提供了新途径，同时为量化用户风险和法律责任奠定了基础。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索社会经济指标（如家庭财富）是否可以通过卫星图像和网络文本的融合模型进行预测，并验证相关假设。

Method: 使用多模态框架，结合卫星图像、LLM生成文本和AI代理检索的文本，通过五种管道预测家庭财富。

Result: 融合视觉与文本模型表现最佳（R-squared 0.77），LLM内部知识优于代理检索文本，部分支持表征收敛假设。

Conclusion: 多模态融合提升了预测性能，验证了部分假设，并发布了大规模数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Motivation: 深度学习在轨迹预测中表现优异，但在动态分布场景中容易发生灾难性遗忘，限制了其实际应用。受神经科学启发，海马体通过有限资源重建知识的能力为解决这一问题提供了思路。

Method: H2C通过两种互补策略选择代表性样本：最大化样本间多样性和等概率采样。利用这些样本计算记忆回放损失函数，以在学习新数据时保留先验知识。

Result: 在INTERACTION数据集上的实验表明，H2C平均减少了22.71%的灾难性遗忘，且无需依赖人工标注的分布变化。

Conclusion: H2C通过模仿海马体机制，有效解决了深度学习在动态场景中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了轨迹预测的持续学习能力。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

Motivation: 研究CoT推理是否真正反映深度推理过程，还是仅基于训练数据的表面现象。

Method: 通过任务、长度和格式三个维度分析CoT推理，使用DataAlchemy环境训练LLM并测试其在不同分布下的表现。

Result: CoT推理在超出训练分布时表现脆弱，效果显著下降。

Conclusion: CoT推理的泛化能力有限，强调了实现真正通用推理的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Conclusion: BIS是一种可靠且广泛适用的工具，可显著降低代码相关任务中LLM的评估成本和努力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Motivation: 现有故障检测模型在复杂场景（如分布偏移）中缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，定义基于模型残差的非共形度量，利用校准数据集计算新样本的p值，构建预测集。

Conclusion: 该方法为故障检测提供了理论框架，实现了明确的风险控制，提升了安全关键应用中诊断系统的可信度。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Motivation: 手绘草图虽直观高效，但缺乏结构约束和语义精确性，难以自动转换为机器可读的图表。

Method: SketchAgent结合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证，生成语义连贯且结构准确的图表。

Result: 提出了Sketch2Diagram Benchmark数据集，包含6,000多个高质量示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计和工程领域具有广泛应用潜力，显著缩小了手绘草图与机器可读图表之间的差距。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Motivation: 解决模型容量与计算效率之间的权衡问题，为资源受限的语言模型部署提供高效解决方案。

Method: 1. 细粒度专家路由；2. 共享专家隔离；3. 无梯度冲突的负载均衡。

Result: 在17M至202M参数的模型中，KV缓存内存减少68%，推理速度提升3.2倍，验证损失降低6.9%，生成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展是资源受限语言模型部署效率的关键。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Motivation: 小型语言模型因其高效性和可部署性在资源受限环境中受到重视，但成员推理攻击对其隐私和知识产权的威胁尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种基于min-k的新攻击方法win-k，并在三个数据集和八个SLMs上进行了实验评估。

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有方法，尤其是在较小模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种有效的成员推理攻击方法，特别适用于小型语言模型。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，跨来源的知识冲突问题日益突出，尤其是在长且冲突的上下文中，模型容易混淆。

Method: KCR框架通过提取冲突上下文中的推理路径（文本或局部知识图），并利用强化学习奖励模型选择逻辑一致的路径。

Result: 实验表明，KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长上下文场景中解决知识冲突的能力。

Conclusion: KCR框架有效增强了LLMs在复杂上下文中的知识冲突解决能力。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

TL;DR: BioDisco是一个多智能体框架，结合语言模型推理和双模式证据系统，用于生成新颖且基于证据的科学假设，并通过迭代优化和时间评估验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化方法在生成新颖且基于证据的假设方面的不足，以及缺乏迭代优化和时间评估的问题。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，结合语言模型推理和双模式证据系统（生物医学知识图谱和文献检索），并引入内部评分和反馈循环进行迭代优化。

Result: 评估显示BioDisco在生成新颖性和重要性方面优于现有方法，并通过时间评估和人类评估验证了其性能。

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个灵活且模块化的工具，可帮助研究人员高效生成新假设。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在规划任务中的不可靠性，提出了一种基于自然语言处理（NLP）的恢复流程，以提升生成计划的质量和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在规划任务中常生成错误或虚构的动作，现有评估方法主要关注成功率，缺乏对计划质量的全面分析。

Method: 提出一个包含NLP评估和三阶段恢复的流程，最终通过符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 恢复流程将成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%，但生成的计划平均仅前2.65个动作可执行，符号生成计划平均长度为8.4个动作。

Conclusion: LLMs在规划任务中缺乏可靠的推理能力，恢复流程虽能提升质量，但仍不及传统规划器的可靠性和质量。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多个领域的广泛应用，其安全性成为关键问题，现有方法依赖迭代提示工程或语义转换，效果有限。

Method: 设计了三种字谜类型（单词搜索、变位词和填字游戏），要求LLM解谜后生成对有害指令的响应。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率为88.8%，其中GPT-4.1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet分别达到96.5%和92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单而强大的方式，将熟悉的字谜转化为有效的越狱策略，突显了LLM推理能力的潜在风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 探讨AI系统快速发展对任务分配的影响，揭示人与机器在任务分工中的长期均衡状态。

Method: 使用格论固定点工具（Tarski和Banach）证明均衡存在性与唯一性，并通过连续模型和动态基准验证结果。

Conclusion: 人类将专注于监督和整合AI模块，形成新的职业角色；政策应促进人机协作以实现福利最大化。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Result: Benchmark对当前最先进的LLM构成挑战，Claude-sonnet-4的WPSR仅为34.6%。RFT显著提升了较小模型的性能（WPSR从3.3%增至10.8%），但在复杂场景中表现下降。

Conclusion: 研究为社区提供了严格的评估标准和高质量数据集，旨在指导GUI代理的未来发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Motivation: 传统基于固定POI集的方法无法捕捉探索行为或城市道路网络的拓扑约束。

Method: 使用道路交叉点图表示轨迹，结合方向性POI聚合和关系感知LNN-Transformer模型。

Result: 在准确率和MRR上显著优于基线方法，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了封闭世界假设的局限性，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Result: 实验显示，最新LLM生成的行程中仅不到10%达到人类水平，并揭示了可行性、合理性和个性化定制等挑战。

Conclusion: TripTailor有望推动开发更理解用户需求、生成实用行程的旅行规划代理。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Result: 实验显示充电成本比EDF和NDF分别降低39%和22%，同时完成类似配送量。

Conclusion: CARGO有效优化电动车辆配送，显著降低成本，适用于实际物流场景。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了MAPF计划在动力学可行性和不确定性方面的不足，显著提升了多智能体路径规划的效率和质量。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Method: LLM在每一步生成精炼答案并评估其改进，直到不再有提升。生成高质量、带偏好标签的数据序列用于微调。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，显著提升模型性能，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

Conclusion: LLM的偏见表现高度依赖社会和组织情境，对多智能体系统和无人监督操作的部署有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline

Motivation: 解决强化学习中复杂任务目标和安全约束的泛化问题，尤其是嵌套长时程任务和不可满足子目标的替代方案。

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解和逐个解决子目标，有效提升了零样本泛化能力，适用于复杂任务和安全约束。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

TL;DR: PCF结合LLMs和数学框架，通过动态参数调整和组合空间设计，实现AI代理在复杂环境中的自适应行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态代理架构在动态环境中的局限性，通过数学方法实现实时参数调整和适应性设计。

Method: 基于组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论，定义多维SPARK参数空间，利用LLMs参数化复杂空间并进行蒙特卡洛模拟。

Result: 在五个复杂度层级的模拟中，发现代理适应性和性能趋势，高复杂度下收益递减，为可扩展设计提供阈值。

Conclusion: PCF支持生成优化代理配置，适用于多种领域，推动下一代自适应和协作AI代理的发展。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

TL;DR: QCBench是一个定量化学基准测试，包含350个计算化学问题，用于评估大型语言模型在化学领域的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补大型语言模型在定量化学推理能力方面的研究空白。

Method: 设计QCBench基准测试，包含7个化学子领域的350个问题，分为基础、中级和专家三个层次。

Result: 评估19个大型语言模型，发现随着任务复杂度增加，性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型的流畅性与科学计算准确性之间存在差距，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

TL;DR: T-GRAG是一种动态、时间感知的检索增强生成框架，通过建模知识的时间演化，解决了现有GraphRAG方法在时间动态性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法忽略了知识的时间动态性，导致时间模糊、检索不敏感和语义冗余等问题。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时间知识图谱生成器、时间查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过视觉修复、标签敏感学习和上下文证据过滤，系统性减少医学报告生成中的不确定性，提升可靠性和临床信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学报告生成中的视觉不确定性、标签分布不确定性和上下文不确定性，以提高系统的可靠性和临床实用性。

Method: 1. 视觉修复模块纠正视图标注错误；2. 标签敏感学习目标增强关键诊断句建模；3. 上下文证据过滤验证历史信息。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中表现最优。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度减少不确定性，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏透明性，用户无法理解设计逻辑或优化输出。

Method: 设计CoT推理流程，创建nvBench-CoT数据集，开发DeepVIS交互界面。

Result: 定量评估、案例研究和用户研究表明，CoT框架显著提升了NL2VIS的质量和用户理解。

Conclusion: CoT框架有效提升了NL2VIS的透明性和生成质量，同时为用户提供了可理解的推理步骤。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力，解决了DFJSP问题中LLM直接应用的不足，显著优于基准方法和启发式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调度规则效率高但缺乏灵活性，深度学习方法需要复杂特征工程且不透明，LLM虽具适应性但直接应用存在三大缺陷。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，利用LLM分析多规划视野的启发式模拟，生成战略经验总结，指导非短视决策。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于基准LLM（71.35%胜率，2.755%相对偏差降低），并超越所有评估的启发式算法。

Conclusion: ReflecSched有效缓解了LLM的三大缺陷，性能与针对每个问题实例的最佳启发式算法相当。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学知识的指数增长使得自动化生成兼具新颖性、可行性和研究价值的科学假设成为核心挑战，现有方法未能系统建模假设的内在特性或融入闭环反馈机制。

Method: HypoAgents框架通过多样性采样生成初始假设，基于N-R-F评分建立先验信念，利用RAG收集外部证据更新后验概率，并通过信息熵识别高不确定性假设进行主动优化。

Result: 在ICLR 2025数据集上，经过12次优化迭代后，假设的平均ELO评分提升116.3，超过真实论文摘要基准17.8，整体不确定性（香农熵）显著降低0.92。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化科学发现提供了一个可解释的概率推理框架，显著提高了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Result: 实验表明该方法性能与现有求解器相当，能有效建模生产者-消费者调度问题并扩展到大规模问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法填补了开源求解器的空白，为复杂调度问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，聚合方法进一步提升了PRMs的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架高效解决了PRM数据构建问题，提出的聚合方法显著提升了模型性能，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试仅限于单服务器环境，无法有效评估代理在真实大规模场景中的能力。

Method: 开发了LiveMCPBench基准测试、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval评估框架，并提出了MCP Copilot Agent。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但不同模型表现差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为评估LLM代理在动态、工具丰富的MCP环境中提供了统一框架。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent显著提升了检测准确性、降低了误报率，并增强了可解释性，适用于企业云环境。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的自动化方法，用于构建多轮自然语言到图查询语言（NL2GQL）的数据集，并开发了MTGQL数据集，以解决现有单轮转换方法在多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2GQL研究多关注单轮转换，而实际应用中用户与图数据库的交互是多轮、动态且依赖上下文的。缺乏高质量多轮数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 提出基于LLMs的自动化方法构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并开发MTGQL数据集（基于金融市场图数据库）。同时提出三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL翻译效果。

Result: 开发了MTGQL数据集，并提出了评估多轮NL2GQL翻译的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来研究奠定了基础，MTGQL数据集的公开将促进多轮NL2GQL领域的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Result: 框架能有效建模角色知识和属性（如性格），提升问答一致性。

Conclusion: AMADEUS为RAG-based RPAs提供了高效解决方案，支持角色属性的鲁棒建模。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

TL;DR: TraceAlign是一个框架，用于追踪大型语言模型（LLM）生成不安全内容的原因，并提出三种干预措施以减少对齐漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在对抗性提示或解码扰动下产生不安全内容的原因，并提出可追溯的解决方案。

Method: 引入Belief Conflict Index (BCI)量化语义不一致性，提出TraceShield、Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss和Prov-Decode三种干预措施。

Result: 在Alignment Drift Benchmark上减少85%的对齐漂移，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐失败提供了可扩展且可追溯的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Result: 实验显示识别准确率显著提升，如GLM-4V准确率提高35.49%至50%。

Conclusion: 该方法为风险检测提供了新的理论和实践支持，提升了准确性、上下文理解和稳定性。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG框架通过结构化激励协作，实现了可扩展且鲁棒的多代理语言生成。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上实验表明，SE-Agent相对提升高达55%，达到开源代理中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自进化机制显著提升LLM代理的推理质量，为复杂任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

Motivation: 解决非专家用户无法直接通过手绘草图生成复杂3D结构的问题。

Method: 引入抽象关系图，结合符号几何关系和稳定性模式，通过扩散模型生成3D位姿并迭代更新。

Result: 在稳定性和视觉相似性上优于基线方法，成功生成多层级3D结构。

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家提供了一种高效且直观的3D结构生成方式。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理的新型攻击方式——通过操纵工具元数据（如名称、描述等）来影响代理行为，称为“吸引力元数据攻击”（AMA）。该方法无需修改代理框架即可实现高攻击成功率（81%-95%），揭示了当前代理架构的系统性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理依赖外部工具进行推理和决策，但工具元数据的操纵未被充分研究。攻击者可通过修改元数据引导代理选择恶意工具，形成新的威胁面。

Method: 提出AMA攻击框架，通过迭代优化生成具有吸引力但合法的工具元数据，无需修改代理执行框架即可实施攻击。

Result: 在10个模拟工具使用场景中，攻击成功率高达81%-95%，且对主任务执行影响极小。攻击甚至能绕过提示级防御和结构化工具选择协议。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击手段，当前代理架构存在系统性漏洞，需开发执行级安全机制以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Result: 提出了两种高效推理方向：单模型优化和多模型协作，旨在减少推理路径长度而不影响性能。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的研究为LRMs的优化提供了新思路，未来需进一步探索单模型与多模型协作的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中对长上下文建模的需求不断增加，但标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为瓶颈。现有稀疏注意力机制存在静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和实现位置感知稀疏注意力计算，减少不必要的计算区域。

Result: 实验表明，DMA在困惑度和多查询关联召回任务中优于多头注意力等方法，并在1.7B参数模型评估中表现突出。

Conclusion: DMA能有效平衡模型效率与长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Conclusion: 情感结构化的程序生成在提升互动叙事体验方面具有巨大潜力，为游戏叙事设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理过程通常过于冗长（称为过度思考），影响效率和可解释性。现有方法仅关注减少响应长度，未深入分析推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 提出双惩罚强化学习框架：1）滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余（FCS中的低贡献步骤）；2）惩罚外部冗余（FCS后的不必要延续）。

Result: 方法显著压缩推理痕迹且几乎不影响准确性，适用于问答和代码生成等任务。外部冗余可安全移除，内部冗余需谨慎减少以避免影响正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升推理效率，还能隐式控制思维链长度，为更简洁、可解释的LRMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Conclusion: 该架构为类脑智能提供了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

*Wouter W. L. Nuijten,Mykola Lukashchuk,Thijs van de Laar,Bert de Vries*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于消息传递的Expected Free Energy（EFE）最小化方法，将组合搜索问题转化为可处理的推理问题，并在实验中优于传统KL控制方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将EFE最小化问题转化为变分自由能最小化问题，以解决组合搜索的复杂性，并验证认知先验在智能体中的有效性。

Method: 通过消息传递方法在因子图上实现EFE最小化，结合变分技术和认知先验，应用于因子化状态空间模型。

Result: 在随机网格世界和部分可观测Minigrid任务中，EFE最小化智能体表现优于传统KL控制方法，展现出更鲁棒的规划和探索能力。

Conclusion: 该方法将主动推理理论实用化，证明了认知先验在智能体中的高效性。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

TL;DR: AirTrafficGen利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化生成复杂的空管训练场景，解决了手动设计耗时且多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计空管训练场景耗时且限制多样性，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用基于图的表示方法编码空域拓扑，利用LLMs生成场景，并通过提示工程实现精细控制。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3等模型能生成高流量且操作真实的场景，支持迭代优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键领域的复杂规划展示了LLMs的潜力，提供了可扩展的空管训练方案。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800
million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key
financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and
reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based
finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that
FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent
benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation
for future research and real-world applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: Traffic-R1是一种基于强化大型语言模型（LLM）的交通信号控制（TSC）基础模型，具有人类推理能力，能零样本泛化、轻量级实时推理，并支持可解释性和多路口通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TSC方法在泛化和实时性上存在局限，而LLM为TSC提供了新的可能性，但需解决推理能力和部署效率问题。

Method: 通过自探索和专家指导的强化LLM迭代训练，结合同步通信网络，开发了轻量级3B参数模型Traffic-R1。

Result: Traffic-R1在基准测试中表现优异，零样本泛化能力强，实际应用中缩短队列5%，减少操作员工作量50%。

Conclusion: Traffic-R1为TSC提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，适合大规模边缘部署，已成功应用于实际交通管理。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

tasks, along with a curated pool of 700 models across multiple modalities and
domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end
assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Result: 通过案例集和公开数据集，实现多维度评估，为LLMs在PHM中的大规模评估奠定基础。

Conclusion: PHM-Bench为从通用模型向PHM专用模型的过渡提供了关键基准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM求解器依赖迭代修复循环，导致高延迟且不可靠，OptiHive旨在解决这一问题。

Method: OptiHive通过单次批量LLM查询生成求解器、问题实例和验证测试，过滤错误组件，并使用统计模型量化不确定性。

Result: OptiHive在复杂优化问题（如多仓库车辆路径问题）上表现优异，将最优解率从5%提升至92%。

Conclusion: OptiHive提供了一种高效、可靠的LLM求解器生成方法，显著提升了优化问题的求解质量。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出PI框架，通过动态干预推理路径，减少冗余并提升LLM的推理可靠性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中生成的推理链存在冗余问题，根源在于训练过程过度依赖结果奖励范式，缺乏对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出PI框架，包含When、How和Which模块，动态干预推理路径，结合人类问题解决经验和认知科学原理。

Result: 实验表明，PI显著缩短推理链并减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架有效提升了LLM推理的可控性和可解释性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计PMA对评估新生儿发育和健康至关重要，但现有深度学习模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，难以支持临床决策。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（PEFT）策略，结合指令调优和低秩适应（LoRA），对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行微调，训练数据为四种2D皮层表面投影图。

Result: 模型预测误差的95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周，并能生成基于发育特征的可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高预测精度的同时增强了模型的可解释性，为围产期神经科学中的透明AI系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Conclusion: CAMA通过因果结构和动态子图注入，有效提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Conclusion: 讨论了Noosemia的哲学、认识论和社会意义，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Conclusion: D2PPO有效解决了扩散策略的表示崩溃问题，显著提升了复杂任务的性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业应用中，大型语言模型的幻觉问题可能导致错误的业务决策，尤其是在联系中心对话分析中，缺乏事实性评估的基准。

Method: 提出3D范式（分解、解耦、脱离）作为人类标注指南和LLM评判提示，并创建FECT数据集。

Result: 通过3D范式对齐LLM评判，实现了对联系中心对话分析中AI生成内容的事实性自动评估。

Conclusion: 研究为评估联系中心对话分析中AI生成内容的事实性提供了新方法和基准数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

TL;DR: XAutoLM是一个基于元学习的AutoML框架，旨在高效优化语言模型的微调流程，显著减少计算开销和环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化框架未能同时解决模型选择和超参数优化问题，导致资源浪费。

Method: XAutoLM通过提取任务和系统级元特征，利用历史经验优化配置选择。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，XAutoLM显著提升了性能，减少了时间和错误率。

Conclusion: XAutoLM为NLP社区提供了资源高效的绿色AI解决方案。

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

Motivation: 固定RAG管道难以应对不同查询的复杂性和成本效率需求。

Result: 在多个QA数据集上验证，MAO-ARAG能高效生成高质量答案，同时控制成本和延迟。

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过动态规划工作流，显著提升了问答系统的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中数据较少，需评估其语法知识。

Method: 构建UrBLiMP基准，包含5,696对最小差异句子，评估20个多语言大模型。

Result: LLaMA-3-70B平均准确率最高（94.73%），但与其他顶级模型（如Gemma-3-27B-PT）无显著差异。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言中捕捉细粒度语法知识既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

Motivation: 互联网上存在大量非结构化信息，将其转化为结构化格式对提升用户体验和内容分发至关重要。

Method: 采用新颖的网页表示方法，结合结构、视觉和文本模态，优化为小型模型学习，使用XGBoost等简单模型进行属性提取。

Result: 系统处理速度超过每秒1000个URL，成本比最便宜的GPT替代方案低1000倍，且准确性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在高效性和成本效益上的显著优势，适用于大规模结构化数据提取。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在电子咨询中生成临床模板的实用性，以提升医生间的信息交换效率。

Method: 使用145个专家模板，通过多代理流程（提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析）测试多个前沿模型。

Result: 模型如o3在全面性上达92.2%，但模板过长且优先级排序不佳，尤其在精神病学和疼痛医学领域表现下降。

Conclusion: LLMs可提升临床信息交换，但需改进优先级排序和长度控制以适应实际医生沟通需求。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法Suffix Optimization (SOP)，用于在不微调模型的情况下限制LLM生成特定受限内容，并通过新基准CoReBench验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM输出空间广泛，内容限制需求因用户群体和时间变化而异，传统微调方法不切实际，因此需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出Suffix Optimization (SOP)，通过在提示后附加优化的短后缀来限制LLM生成特定内容，同时保持输出质量。

Result: SOP在CoReBench上表现优于基线方法，平均限制率提升6%-17%，并在商业平台POE上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: SOP为自适应内容限制提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，适用于动态变化的实际需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天日志提供了关于LLM用户的丰富信息，但用户行为模式常被查询的变异性掩盖。

Method: 提出新任务，分割聊天查询，并进行历时分析。

Result: 发现用户查询模式随时间变化，早期强调请求，后期趋于收敛；模型能力影响用户行为。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM用户行为提供了新视角，并揭示了模型更新对用户行为的影响。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简化或静态，无法反映真实世界数据科学的复杂性和多模态需求。WebDS填补了这一空白。

Method: 设计了870个任务，涵盖从结构化政府数据到非结构化新闻媒体的多种网站，要求代理执行多步骤操作并使用工具。

Result: 当前SOTA LLM代理在WebDS上表现不佳（如Browser Use仅完成15%任务），揭示了信息基础薄弱、重复行为和走捷径等新失败模式。

Conclusion: WebDS为开发实用的LLM数据科学提供了更真实、更全面的测试平台，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中平均提升12.57%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知和多专家框架能有效提升LLM的数学能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中部分相关知识利用的挑战，尤其是在知识库不完整时。

Method: 通过构建部分相关知识（移除答案路径的三元组变体）并实验验证唤醒效应。

Result: 在KGQA数据集上验证了唤醒效应的有效性，并在新任务Unseen Entity KGQA中表现更优。

Conclusion: 部分相关知识可有效唤醒LLMs，优于依赖嵌入相似性的传统方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

Conclusion: KEDAS展示了知识编辑对齐的理想范式，兼具鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

Conclusion: D-SCoRE简单、可扩展，能高效生成QA数据并支持高性能微调。

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练数据稀缺且多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提取QA种子数据中的知识点构建图谱，通过路径采样和扩散合成技术生成多样化QA数据。

Result: 合成的LinkQA数据集（50B tokens）使Llama-3 8B在MMLU和CMMLU上平均提升11.51%。

Conclusion: LinkSyn能有效提升模型性能，适用于不同规模和初始计算量的模型。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Conclusion: BoostQA展示了强大的可扩展性，随着模型规模、数据量和初始FLOPs的增加，性能持续提升。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化生成经济高效的市场洞察提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models

At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

Result: BADF能全面映射和分析LLM中的偏见关联，提供新见解。

Conclusion: BADF为LLM偏见研究提供可扩展工具，促进对开放生成偏见的理解。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

Motivation: LLMs在多跳问答任务中表现不佳，主要因其难以捕捉实体间的深层概念关系。

Method: ORACLE框架分三阶段：动态构建问题特定知识本体，转化为一阶逻辑推理链，系统分解原始查询为逻辑子问题。

Result: 在多个标准MQA基准测试中表现优异，媲美当前最优模型，生成更逻辑化和可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: ORACLE框架有效提升了LLMs在复杂推理任务中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SFT方法依赖未过滤的数据集，包含冗余和低质量样本，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。需要一种更高效的数据选择策略。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Influence Quadrant（DIQ）策略，优先选择高难度-高梯度影响的样本，平衡复杂推理和优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，DIQ仅需1%的数据即可匹配全数据集性能，10%的数据优于基线，且生成结果更符合专家实践。

Conclusion: DIQ通过平衡样本难度和梯度影响，显著提升了医学推理任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在结构化领域（如源代码）的应用存在挑战，因为编程语言具有严格的语法和语义规则，而标准训练中的随机标记破坏方法可能忽略这些结构。

Method: 提出了一种语法感知的扩散框架，通过选择性破坏AST子树中的语法有意义代码片段，而非随机标记，以保留代码的层次结构。

Result: 实验表明，语法感知的破坏显著提高了语法正确性、重建准确性以及对未见代码模式的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合结构信息的扩散训练具有潜力，语法引导的去噪是改进代码生成任务中扩散模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

Conclusion: TeSent数据集及其评估套件为泰卢固语NLP任务提供了重要资源，并展示了理性训练在模型性能和可解释性方面的优势。

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Method: 方法是通过综合语言学、认知科学和计算机科学的证据，分析LLMs的设计和广泛使用如何导致语言和推理的趋同。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs通过训练数据中的模式反映和强化主流风格，同时边缘化其他声音，可能导致认知多样性的减少。

Conclusion: 结论指出，若不加以控制，这种同质化可能削弱集体智慧和适应能力所依赖的认知多样性。

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

*Sara Câmara,Eduardo Luz,Valéria Carvalho,Ivan Meneghini,Gladston Moreira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOPrompt是一种多目标进化优化框架，旨在同时优化提示的准确性和上下文大小（以令牌计）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计提示复杂且耗时，自动提示优化成为研究热点，但现有方法多关注单一目标（如性能），忽略了效率与效果的平衡。

Method: 提出MOPrompt框架，利用多目标进化优化（EMO）生成提示的Pareto前沿，平衡上下文大小与性能。

Result: 在葡萄牙语情感分析任务中，MOPrompt显著优于基线框架，Sabiazinho模型下，相同峰值准确率（0.97）下令牌长度减少31%。

Conclusion: MOPrompt为实际应用中LLM的部署提供了关键工具，展示了多目标优化在提示工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

TL;DR: 论文提出了PromptAnatomy框架，通过分解提示的功能组件并选择性扰动（ComPerturb）来生成多样化的对抗样本，结合PPL过滤机制提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法将提示视为单一文本，忽略其结构异质性，导致评估不全面。

Method: 提出PromptAnatomy框架，分解提示为功能组件，使用ComPerturb选择性扰动，并引入PPL过滤机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLMs上，ComPerturb实现了最高攻击成功率，验证了提示结构感知的重要性。

Conclusion: 提示结构感知和受控扰动对LLM的对抗鲁棒性评估至关重要。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

*Maziyar Panahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenMed NER通过轻量级领域自适应预训练（DAPT）和参数高效的低秩适应（LoRA），在12个生物医学NER基准测试中取得10个SOTA性能，计算高效且环保。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域命名实体识别（NER）在多样实体类型和计算效率上的挑战。

Method: 结合DAPT和LoRA，使用DeBERTa-v3等模型在公开数据集上进行预训练和微调。

Result: 在12个基准测试中10个取得SOTA，尤其在基因和临床细胞系数据上提升显著。

Conclusion: 开源模型通过策略性适应可超越闭源方案，高效且合规。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在多语言环境中区分机器生成文本（MGT）和人类写作的挑战，提出了多语言作者归属（AA）问题，并评估了单语言AA方法在多语言环境中的适用性和跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的文本生成能力接近人类水平，区分机器生成文本和人类写作变得困难。现有的作者归属研究多局限于单语言（尤其是英语），忽视了现代LLMs的多语言特性。

Method: 研究覆盖18种语言和8种生成器（7种LLMs和人类作者），评估单语言AA方法在多语言环境中的适用性、跨语言迁移能力及生成器对归属性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，某些单语言AA方法可适应多语言环境，但在跨语言家族迁移时存在显著局限性，凸显了多语言AA的复杂性。

Conclusion: 多语言AA面临重大挑战，需开发更鲁棒的方法以适应现实场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CUPID是一个评估LLMs是否能从多轮交互中推断用户动态偏好的基准测试，结果显示当前先进LLMs表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好是动态且依赖于上下文的，而现有LLMs假设用户偏好是静态的，需要改进以实现更个性化的交互。

Method: 引入CUPID基准测试，包含756个人工标注的交互会话历史，评估LLMs在新请求中推断和应用用户偏好的能力。

Result: 评估10个开源和专有LLMs，表现较差（精度低于50%，召回率低于65%）。

Conclusion: LLMs需提升上下文个性化能力，CUPID可作为改进资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

TL;DR: BiPRM提出了一种双向评估范式，通过结合左右双向评估提升推理质量，实验证明其优于单向方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM的单向左到右评估范式无法利用全局上下文，难以验证早期步骤的连贯性。

Method: BiPRM引入并行右到左评估流，通过提示修改实现，无需额外参数或延迟。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，BiPRM显著优于单向基线，最高提升31.9%。

Conclusion: BiPRM高效、兼容性强，为基于过程的奖励建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

Motivation: 当前RAG方法在生成过程中未能充分利用知识，尤其是参数化知识与检索知识的协同作用有限，导致生成内容可能被误导或未能准确利用知识。

Method: 提出CoCoA-zero框架，通过多代理进行条件知识归纳和答案推理；进一步开发CoCoA，通过长链训练策略合成多代理推理轨迹以微调LLM。

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放域和多跳QA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架显著提升了参数化知识与检索知识的协同利用能力，为RAG方法提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Motivation: LLM在整合广泛上下文时容易引入无关信息，现有研究关注语义泄漏，本文提出表达泄漏现象，即模型生成与输入无关的情感化表达。

Method: 收集基准数据集，设计自动生成方案，提出与人工评估一致的自动评估流程，分析不同规模模型的表现。

Result: 模型规模扩大可减少表达泄漏，但需专门处理；负向情感注入提示会导致更高的表达泄漏率。

Conclusion: 表达泄漏需在模型构建中专门处理，提示无效；负向情感对生成过程干扰更大。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Conclusion: IterChat框架有效解决了多轮偏好提取的标注和训练难题，提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将标记级测量聚合为标量分数，忽略了异常的位置信息，导致对局部对抗性扰动的检测失败。

Method: 引入Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT)，将标记级差异视为时间序列信号，应用连续小波变换生成二维时间-尺度表示。

Result: 在RAID基准测试中，TDT的AUROC达到0.855（比最佳基线提升7.1%），在对抗性任务中表现更优（AUROC提升14.1%）。

Conclusion: AI生成文本具有显著的非平稳性，保留时间动态信息对鲁棒检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

Motivation: 现有希伯来语NLP基准主要关注形态句法任务，忽略了语义理解，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计新的标注指南、众包协议和评估指标，构建包含30,147个问答对的HeQ数据集。

Result: 标准评估指标（如F1和EM）不适用于希伯来语，提出了改进方法；模型在形态句法和MRC任务上表现相关性低。

Conclusion: HeQ的开发揭示了形态丰富语言在NLU中的挑战，推动了希伯来语及其他类似语言的NLU模型发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

*Rubin Wei,Jiaqi Cao,Jiarui Wang,Jushi Kai,Qipeng Guo,Bowen Zhou,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过预训练的可微分外部记忆（MLP）来解耦LLM的记忆功能，显著减少了幻觉问题，并在性能和推理速度上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仅解码器LLM在知识密集型任务中常出现幻觉问题，现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法因非参数化特性难以与LLM深度交互。

Method: 使用预训练的MLP作为外部记忆，模仿检索器行为，与LLM解码器结合，分别通过语言建模和检索器模仿进行预训练。

Result: 在WikiText-103和Web数据集上分别提升17.5%和24.1%，推理速度更快，且在幻觉基准和记忆密集型任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少幻觉问题，提升性能与推理速度，未来将开源代码和模型。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但常生成流畅但事实错误或无依据的幻觉输出。这促使研究如何有效检测和减少此类问题。

Method: 提出Counterfactual Probing方法，动态生成包含细微错误的对比陈述，评估模型对这些扰动的敏感性。假设真实知识对对比变化具有鲁棒性，而幻觉内容则表现出不一致的置信模式。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、事实陈述数据集和定制幻觉示例上的全面评估显示，该方法在检测性能上优于基线方法，自适应缓解策略平均降低幻觉评分24.5%。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing无需模型重新训练，可作为实时验证机制集成到现有LLM流程中，有效检测和减少幻觉输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PunGPT2是首个完全开源的旁遮普语大语言模型套件，通过优化的分词器和预训练目标捕捉旁遮普语的独特特征，并引入Pun-RAG和Pun-Instruct提升性能。Quantum-RAG结合量子语义匹配，显著优于多语言基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言（如旁遮普语）在NLP领域长期被忽视，缺乏专门的大语言模型。本文旨在填补这一空白，为旁遮普语提供高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 训练PunGPT2模型，使用优化的分词器和预训练目标；2. 开发Pun-RAG框架，结合FAISS检索器；3. 提出Pun-Instruct，通过QLoRA实现高效指令微调；4. 创新Quantum-RAG，融合稀疏和密集检索方法。

Result: PunGPT2在困惑度、事实性和流畅性上显著优于多语言基线模型（如mBERT、mT5、MuRIL）。

Conclusion: 本文为低资源语言提供了可扩展的大语言模型解决方案，并首次将量子表示应用于低资源语言生成，具有开创性意义。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）过度使用某些词汇（如“delve”和“intricate”）的原因，发现人类反馈学习（LHF）是主要驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs过度使用特定词汇的原因尚不明确，研究旨在揭示LHF对词汇选择的影响。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama模型，设计实验模拟LHF过程，检测词汇偏好。

Result: 实验表明LHF导致词汇过度使用，且不同人群（LHF工作者与LLM用户）的词汇期望存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据和程序透明度在AI对齐研究中的重要性，为可解释AI提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROVER框架通过递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，提升视觉语言模型在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要推理长视频帧序列的任务中表现不佳，限制了其在具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解长视频轨迹为子任务段，结合上下文学习实现。

Result: 在OpenX Embodiment和RoboCasa数据集上，ROVER在任务进度估计、帧级自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线。

Conclusion: ROVER通过减少每步推理的帧数，缓解幻觉问题，且时间复杂度随视频长度线性增长。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Motivation: 现有方法在处理长文档检索时，因上下文依赖和嵌入模型限制，性能提升有限。

Method: 提出情境化嵌入模型（SitEmb），通过训练范式改进短块在上下文中的表示。

Result: SitEmb模型在书情节检索数据集上表现优异，1B参数的SitEmb-v1超越多个7-8B参数模型，8B参数的SitEmb-v1.5性能提升超10%。

Conclusion: 情境化嵌入模型有效解决了长文档检索中的上下文依赖问题，并在多语言和下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance,
comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务产品页面信息复杂，现有问答系统未能有效利用用户上下文和多样化产品信息，导致用户认知负担。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，结合对话历史、用户画像和产品属性，处理多样化的查询类型。

Result: 系统能够高效处理客观、主观和多意图查询，并识别产品目录中的信息缺口。

Conclusion: 该框架为电子商务问答系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，并引入了适用于RAG系统评估的新指标。

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 论文为语音驱动的多模态角色扮演研究提供了数据和评估基础，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing
research and to foster further developments in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注表面感知，缺乏对模型在语音场景中上下文和推理能力的深入考察。

Method: SpeechR通过三个维度（事实检索、程序推理和规范性判断）和三种评估格式（选择题、生成式和声学特征）来评估模型。

Result: 评估11个先进模型发现，高转录准确率并不等同于强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为语音推理提供了结构化基准，有助于更针对性地分析模型能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

TL;DR: STIM框架通过标记级记忆源分析，揭示LLMs在复杂或长尾任务中依赖记忆，尤其是局部记忆导致错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在推理任务中因记忆依赖导致的错误问题，尤其是Chain-of-Thought推理中的中间错误。

Method: 提出STIM框架，基于预训练语料统计共现，将推理链中的标记归因于局部、中程或远程记忆源。

Result: 模型在复杂或长尾任务中更依赖记忆，局部记忆是错误主因（占67%错误标记），STIM记忆分数可预测错误标记。

Conclusion: STIM为诊断和改进模型推理提供有力工具，适用于其他结构化逐步生成任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

### [144] [ProCut: LLM Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02053)
*Zhentao Xu,Fengyi Li,Albert Chen,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCut是一种无需训练的提示压缩框架，通过属性分析减少提示模板的冗余，显著降低提示大小并保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中，提示模板膨胀导致维护困难、推理延迟和成本增加。

Method: ProCut将提示模板分段为语义单元，量化其对任务性能的影响，并修剪低效部分。

Result: 实验表明，ProCut在减少78%令牌的同时，任务性能保持或略有提升，优于其他方法62%。

Conclusion: ProCut是一种高效、灵活的提示压缩方法，适用于工业LLM系统。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

*Gustaf Ahdritz,Anat Kleiman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SMeL测试，评估语言模型过滤不可信信息的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，甚至优秀模型也存在高幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网中存在大量不可信内容，但语言模型是否能像人类一样过滤这些信息尚不明确。

Method: 引入Synthetic Media Literacy Test (SMeL Test)，测试多种指令调优语言模型的能力。

Result: 无模型能稳定信任可靠来源，优秀模型幻觉率高达70%，且大模型未必优于小模型。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在过滤不可信信息上的不足，为未来方法开发提供指导。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的谄媚行为，揭示了其内部机制，包括用户意见如何引发谄媚以及语法视角的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中谄媚行为的内部机制，以改进模型的对齐和真实性。

Method: 通过系统研究用户意见对谄媚行为的影响，结合logit-lens分析和因果激活修补技术，分析模型的内部表现。

Result: 发现谄媚行为源于深层表征的偏好偏移和分歧，用户权威对行为无影响，第一人称提示比第三人称更易引发谄媚。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为是深层知识结构被覆盖的结果，对AI对齐和真实性系统设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了青少年对社交媒体中“青少年毒性”语言的独特感知，构建了首个中文数据集，并发现结合上下文信息可显著提升现有毒性检测技术的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年对毒性内容的理解与成人不同，但现有研究忽略了青少年独特的毒性语言。

Method: 以中国青少年为研究对象，构建首个中文“青少年毒性”数据集，并进行广泛分析。

Result: 青少年的毒性感知与语境因素相关，结合元信息可提升检测准确性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注青少年中心的毒性检测，并提出相关建议。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然强大但成本高，研究旨在通过元学习提升小型模型的性能和可解释性。

Method: 结合一阶MAML和子集掩码LM预训练，构建了四个LLama风格的解码器模型（11M-570M参数）。

Result: 模型在相同计算条件下性能更优，训练动态更易解读，表现为两阶段的表示变化（多样化与压缩）。

Conclusion: 元学习不仅加速训练，还提供了模型适应过程的紧凑、可解释特征。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Conclusion: Seed Diffusion Preview在代码模型的速度-质量帕累托前沿上确立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估LLM的数学能力，尤其是证明类问题，手动创建成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 提出Proof2X路线图，将数学证明转化为易验证的问题，并设计新型混合格式问题（$m$-out-of-$n$多法官问题），以抵抗猜测和表面模式匹配。

Result: 通过AlgGeoTest（456个代数几何问题）评估，发现先进LLM在代数几何理解上存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid框架和AlgGeoTest为深入研究AI系统的数学智能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中文化与语言编码的关系，以促进公平性和包容性。

Method: 扩展语言特定神经元的定位方法，引入MUREL数据集（85.2百万标记，覆盖六种文化），进行神经元定位和干预实验。

Result: 发现文化特定神经元主要分布在高层，可独立调节，与语言或其他文化神经元分离。

Conclusion: 文化知识在多语言模型中可以独立编辑，有助于提升公平性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

Result: 干扰不对称，且与脚本相关，而非语系或嵌入相似性。干扰矩阵能有效预测下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 干扰矩阵可作为工具优化多语言模型设计，提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

Conclusion: 动态调整奖励信号可有效提升RLVR性能，为LLMs的推理能力优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Motivation: 阿拉伯世界存在现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言之间的显著差异，这对自然语言处理（如机器翻译）构成挑战。

Method: 开发了两个专门模型（MSA-to-Shami和Shami-to-MSA），基于AraT5v2-base-1024架构，并在Nabra数据集上微调，使用MADAR语料库进行测试。

Result: MSA-to-Shami模型在GPT-4.1评估下获得了4.01/5.0的高分，表明其翻译准确且方言地道。

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT为方言阿拉伯语翻译提供了高保真工具，适用于内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and
intercultural communication.

Result: Danish Dynaword规模是同类数据集的四倍，完全开源，并已获得多领域贡献。

Conclusion: Dynaword方法为数据集提供了可持续的社区协作框架，提升了数据集的开放性和质量。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器对于维持RAG系统的响应相关性至关重要。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在输入超过预训练上下文窗口时的性能下降问题，特别是RoPE的OOD行为。

Method: 提出LaMPE，利用参数化缩放sigmoid函数动态调整位置编码，并设计多粒度注意力机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LaMPE显著优于现有长度外推方法。

Conclusion: LaMPE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种基于RoPE的大语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at
https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

Conclusion: \veomni展示了训练大规模全模态大语言模型的高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for
training large omni-modal LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出CAMERA框架，通过微专家（micro-expert）压缩单元优化MoE模型，减少计算和存储开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型参数增长带来的性能提升不成比例，且现有方法在性能和计算效率上仍有挑战。

Method: 提出CAMERA框架，包括微专家冗余识别（CAMERA）、结构化剪枝（CAMERA-P）和混合精度量化（CAMERA-Q）。

Result: 在9个下游任务中，CAMERA-P在20%-60%剪枝率下表现优于基线，CAMERA-Q在2-bit量化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAMERA框架高效且轻量，能在单GPU上快速分析大规模模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过神经元层面分析，揭示了政治微调对语言模型政治立场的影响机制，并提出抑制方法减少跨话题立场泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治微调对语言模型政治立场的影响机制，尤其是跨话题立场泛化的内部原因。

Method: 提出PNLAC方法识别两类政治神经元，并设计InhibitFT抑制方法减少跨话题泛化。

Result: 实验验证了神经元类型的鲁棒性，InhibitFT平均减少20%跨话题泛化，仅抑制5%神经元即有效。

Conclusion: 通过神经元抑制方法可有效控制政治微调的跨话题影响，同时保持话题特定性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩方法CompressKV，通过识别关键注意力头并分层自适应分配缓存，显著提升了LLMs的长上下文处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有KV缓存压缩方法因忽略注意力头功能差异而导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 识别关键注意力头以确定重要token，并分层自适应分配KV缓存。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV通过优化注意力头选择和分层策略，有效提升了LLMs的缓存效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的连续知识图谱嵌入模型BAKE，通过贝叶斯后验更新和持续聚类方法有效缓解了传统模型在动态知识图谱中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入模型仅适用于静态图谱，而动态知识图谱的持续演化需要解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: BAKE采用贝叶斯后验更新策略，将新数据视为模型先验的更新，并提出持续聚类方法约束新旧知识间的演化差异。

Result: 实验表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE通过贝叶斯更新和聚类约束，有效解决了动态知识图谱嵌入中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）替代专家评估来测量创新，提出了一个LLM框架，并在两个不同场景中验证其性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创新测量依赖专家评估和特定情境的代理指标，限制了研究的适用范围。LLM的潜力可以克服这些限制。

Method: 设计了一个LLM框架，通过非结构化文本数据评估创新性，并在软件更新和用户反馈两个场景中测试其性能。

Result: LLM框架的F1分数高于其他方法，且结果高度一致。

Conclusion: LLM框架为创新测量提供了可靠、广泛适用的工具，并讨论了设计决策对性能的影响。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类任务中，单次优化周期后分类准确率提升约3%。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt框架通用性强，仅需LLM黑盒访问和自动评估指标，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

Motivation: 探讨在线平台在政治抗议中如何成为身份构建和动员的工具。

Method: 采用定性方法分析视觉修辞、语言话语和数字讽刺。

Result: Facebook上的视觉和语言策略不仅动员了公众情绪，还构建了挑战威权叙事的集体身份。

Conclusion: 在线平台在数字时代可作为身份构建和政治动员的有力工具。

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

Motivation: 了解LLMs如何编码跨语言的心理语言学知识，以及语言身份是否影响其行为。

Method: 通过声音象征和词效价任务，评估Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct在单语和双语提示下的表现。

Result: 模型输出受语言身份影响，Qwen对荷兰语和中文的区分更敏感；深层网络中心理语言学信号更易解码，中文提示的效价表征更稳定。

Conclusion: 语言身份显著影响LLMs的输出和内部表征，为跨语言认知模型的应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Conclusion: LLMs在处理算术任务时采用了一种模块化和可解释的结构，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Result: 通过Generate-Critic架构优化后，轻量级开源LLMs的形式符合度提高了5.88%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在生成文化重要且形式受限文本时的优势与局限，为未来优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Result: 模型在无监督情况下学习到类似人类IPA元音图的音素表征，且存在专门促进语音信息的头部。

Conclusion: Llama模型通过内部音素模型完成语音任务，其潜在空间具有高级别的音素组织，与人类语音系统相似。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

Motivation: 通用Transformer模型在技术文档的细粒度语法和实体关系处理上表现不佳，需要更专业的模型。

Method: CGT通过动态图构建输入标记的局部结构（GNN处理），再通过Transformer捕获全局依赖，结合RAG管道。

Result: CGT在准确率上比GPT-2高24.7%，且参数减少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT在技术语言处理中表现出色，适用于实际应用中的实体跟踪和检索增强任务。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student

paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Motivation: 可比语料库在多语言自然语言处理中很有用，尤其是在某些领域或语言缺乏平行文本时。

Method: 从Wikipedia和EURONEWS构建英语、法语和阿拉伯语的可比语料库，并实验两种跨语言相似度度量方法（双语词典和CL-LSI）对齐文档。

Result: 实验表明CL-LSI优于词典方法，并能实现主题和事件级别的对齐。

Conclusion: CL-LSI是一种有效的跨语言文档对齐方法，适用于主题和事件级别的对齐。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多视角话语分析方法，结合领域特定的对话动作和话语关系，以解决数学教育中话语分析的多功能性和遗漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决话语分析中的多功能性和遗漏问题，以提升数学教育中的反馈质量。

Method: 提出多视角话语分析框架，整合领域特定的对话动作（43个标签）和话语关系（16种关系），应用于两个数学教育数据集。

Result: 发现无对话动作的话语在课堂中具有重要功能，如引导、确认和结构化。

Conclusion: 结合话语关系和对话动作可提升AI辅助教育系统的反馈效果，框架对开发教育AI代理也有帮助。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双向GRU的神经网络方法，用于自动标注临床文本中的SNOMED CT概念，性能优于传统规则系统，计算成本低于基于Transformer的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的标准化医学概念标注对结构化数据提取和决策支持至关重要，但手动标注耗时且难以规模化。

Method: 使用双向GRU模型，结合MIMIC-IV数据集，通过SpaCy和SciBERT预处理文本，分割为19个标记的块，并利用上下文、句法和形态特征进行标注。

Result: 模型在验证集上达到90%的F1分数，优于传统规则系统，与现有神经模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念标注，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: Sparse-dLLM通过动态缓存淘汰和稀疏注意力优化，显著提升了dLLMs的推理效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs在推理时存在高计算复杂度和内存开销，现有缓存技术因存储全层状态而内存占用大，限制了长上下文应用。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合动态缓存淘汰和延迟双向稀疏缓存，利用注意力模式中的稀疏性选择性保留关键令牌。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream系列实验中，Sparse-dLLM实现了10倍吞吐量提升，性能相当且内存成本相近。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在效率和效果上优于现有方法，为dLLMs的推理优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark是一个用于评估医学大语言模型（MLLMs）在眼科诊断中幻觉问题的新基准，通过多阶段框架显著减少幻觉，提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，源于知识不足、视觉定位能力有限及数据稀缺，现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计三阶段多智能体框架（知识检索、案例研究、结果验证）来缓解幻觉。

Result: 实验表明该框架显著减少幻觉，提升模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中逐字记忆的多面性及其潜在机制。

Method: 训练卷积神经网络（CNN）分析LLM的注意力权重，并与现有分类法对比。

Result: 现有分类法表现不佳，新分类法将记忆样本分为三类：基于语言建模能力猜测的、因训练集高重复性回忆的、非记忆样本。研究发现少样本逐字记忆无独特注意力机制。

Conclusion: 新分类法更准确，部分可提取样本实为模型猜测，需单独研究。开发了可视化技术定位注意力权重区域。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和标注稀缺而缺乏自动化分析，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用ChatGPT伪标签与人工审核结合的混合方法，构建数据集，并训练两种Transformer模型进行方面和情感分类。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型在少量人工监督下仍保持高准确率，减少方面类别显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合大语言模型与人工标注的有效方法，为阿拉伯语医疗领域情感分析提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

Motivation: 当前多LLM结合方法缺乏结构化，导致生成内容不可靠，MArgE旨在通过计算论证学提供可验证的结构化路径。

Method: 使用Argumentative LLMs构建结构化论证树，为任务验证提供可追溯的决策路径。

Result: MArgE在实验中显著优于单LLM、开源模型及非结构化多LLM方法。

Conclusion: 引入形式化论证机制能有效提升多LLM输出的结合效果。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

TL;DR: CharBench是一个新的字符级任务基准测试，规模远超现有方案，评估显示现代LLMs在此类任务上表现不佳，平均准确率低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在字符级任务（如计数或定位）上的表现不佳问题，并澄清分词对模型性能的影响。

Method: 引入CharBench基准测试，评估多种领先的开源和专有模型，分析单词内在属性及分词对性能的影响。

Result: 模型在CharBench上表现差，平均准确率43.6%和32.3%；分词属性与任务表现相关性弱，单词长度和字符计数影响更大。

Conclusion: CharBench为改进模型在字符级任务的性能提供了工具，未来研究可基于此展开。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“交互蒸馏”的新方法，用于解决奖励模型（RM）中的注意力分配问题，通过优化注意力机制提升偏好建模的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流偏好建模在奖励模型（RM）中存在注意力分配不足的问题，导致判断信号容易被上下文误导。这源于解码器架构的单向注意力机制和独立编码范式的局限性。

Method: 提出“交互蒸馏”框架，通过引入基于交互的自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，指导偏好建模模拟教师的注意力模式，实现注意力对齐。

Result: 实验表明，交互蒸馏能提供更稳定和通用的奖励信号，优于现有针对数据噪声的RM优化方法。

Conclusion: 注意力分配问题是RM的根本限制，交互蒸馏为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准注意力机制O(N²)复杂度问题，提供高效长距离建模方案。

Method: 采用层间指针链，每层指针选择依赖前层指针位置，形成显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列上实现2-10倍加速，2048标记内复制任务准确率>95%，学习到可解释指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer为无需预训练的长距离建模提供高效替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Motivation: 尽管多语言基准数据集被广泛用于评估大型语言模型（LLM），但其质量常被忽视，尤其是半自动生成的数据集可能存在错误。

Method: 手动分析法语和泰卢固语的多语言评估数据集，识别错误并修正，比较LLM在原始和修正数据集上的性能差异。

Conclusion: 数据集不应被视为不可变，建议定期检查、修正和版本化，同时为数据集创建者和使用者提供改进质量的建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像AI模型的广泛应用，数据所有者需要可靠机制验证其专有数据是否被滥用，现有方法在验证效果和数据完整性之间存在权衡。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉的痕迹，以实现所有权验证。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage实现了高验证准确性，对下游性能影响极小。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用机制，保护图像数据集的所有权，促进安全共享和数据驱动AI的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于扩散框架的单阶段生成模型，通过联合合成显微结构图像和分割掩码，显著提高了金属合金显微结构分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属合金显微结构分割中缺乏人工标注的相位掩码，尤其是稀有或复杂形态的数据，限制了机器学习的效果。

Method: PF-DiffSeg利用全局相位分数向量控制，通过单阶段去噪扩散框架生成图像和掩码，增强数据多样性和训练效率。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法在少数类别上显著提升了分割准确性，并优于两阶段掩码引导扩散和GAN基线。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg为金属学应用提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案，统一了生成和条件化框架。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Method: 采用自编码器与RNN、3D CNN等架构结合的混合深度学习方法，并在不同数据集上评估。

Result: SSIM指标从0.69提升至0.82，3D CNN和ConvLSTM模型表现最佳，灰度视频预测效果最好。

Conclusion: 混合模型在视频帧预测中表现优异，尤其是3D CNN和ConvLSTM架构，灰度视频预测效果更佳。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [192] [Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852)
*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的上下文引导熵模型（CGT），通过重新采样时间上下文和依赖加权的空间上下文，减少视频冗余，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用时间上下文时增加了模型复杂度和计算成本，而空间上下文模型缺乏对依赖顺序的显式建模，限制了解码时的上下文可用性。

Method: 设计了时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络），显式建模空间依赖顺序，并提取关键时间信息。

Result: CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型在减少计算成本的同时，显著提升了熵建模效率。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一种自监督预训练框架，专注于学习事件数据的时空信息，特别适合循环模型，并在多个下游任务中取得领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件数据的长期时间信息，导致循环模型在预训练中表现不佳。

Method: 提出TESPEC框架，利用掩码图像建模范式，设计新重建目标，通过累积事件生成伪灰度视频。

Result: 在目标检测、语义分割和深度估计等任务中取得领先性能。

Conclusion: TESPEC首次在预训练中利用长事件序列，显著提升了循环模型的表现。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成的点云数据量大，对存储、带宽和处理成本构成挑战，需高效下采样方法。

Method: 分两步：1) 无监督密度峰值分类器与监督朴素贝叶斯分类器检测物体存在；2) 采样预算分配策略保留物体信息。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，效率和效果均优。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到下游模型，是自动驾驶点云下采样的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点云区分难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响表达可靠性和性能。

Method: 提出GaussianCross，结合3D高斯点技术将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并通过三属性自适应蒸馏模块构建3D特征场，捕获多模态一致性特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，参数和数据效率高，线性探测和有限数据训练下性能优于现有方法，泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过跨模态一致性特征学习，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为3D场景理解提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中注意力机制不协调导致的嵌入学习效果不佳问题。

Method: 引入LPWCA捕获细粒度区域-语义关联，结合PAI系统协调多种注意力机制。

Result: 在十个基准测试中达到最优性能，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA显著提升模型性能，并提供更聚焦和语义对齐的注意力模式。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LPD的方法，通过学习部分解相关的公共空间来解决视频搜索中的视觉多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频搜索中视觉多样性带来的挑战，现有方法未能充分利用特征的多样性。

Method: LPD通过为每个视频和文本特征构建独立的公共空间，并引入解相关损失和基于熵的多空间三元组排序损失。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS基准测试中验证了LPD的有效性，并展示了其提升结果多样性的能力。

Conclusion: LPD通过多样化公共空间和优化损失函数，显著提升了视频搜索的全面性和多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Conclusion: ROVI为实例文本到图像生成提供了高质量数据集，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种可靠且实用的稀疏3D重建方法。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Motivation: 现代深度学习模型依赖大规模数据集，但许多数据集是专有或敏感的，数据集所有权验证（DOV）用于保护版权。然而，现有研究对DOV的评估过于简化，导致虚假的安全感。

Method: 提出教师-学生模型框架，利用OOD数据集转移任务相关知识，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型筛选最优子集，选择性转移知识以平衡泛化与规避效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识符，在泛化和规避效果上显著优于九种现有攻击方法，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需要长期发展以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Result: 模型在复杂航天器上图像质量更高，但在简单小行星上几何重建更优；Hunyuan-3D在航天器感知和小行星几何上表现最佳。

Conclusion: DreamSat-2.0为领域依赖性模型性能提供了新见解，并显著改进了先前工作。

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

### [206] [COSTARR: Consolidated Open Set Technique with Attenuation for Robust Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01087)
*Ryan Rabinowitz,Steve Cruz,Walter Scheirer,Terrance E. Boult*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSTARR提出了一种新的衰减假设，通过结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失来改进开放集识别（OSR），显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉假设，忽略了衰减信息，COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息提升性能。

Method: COSTARR结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，利用预衰减和后衰减特征，并通过概率解释其评分。

Result: 在多种架构（ViTs、ConvNeXts、ResNet）和大规模数据集上，COSTARR显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，显著提升了开放集识别的能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

provide enhanced accuracy and reduced false positives. This framework aims to
significantly improve environmental compliance, operational safety, and public
health outcomes by enabling precise, automated monitoring of industrial
emissions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Trans-Adapter，一种即插即用的适配器，使基于扩散的修复模型能直接处理透明图像，解决现有方法在透明图像修复中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，透明图像修复通常需要两阶段处理（修复+抠图），但会导致透明度不一致和边缘锯齿问题。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持ControlNet可控编辑，并可集成到多种社区模型中。引入LayerBench数据集和新的透明度边缘质量评估指标。

Result: 实验证明Trans-Adapter在透明图像修复中有效，解决了透明度和边缘问题。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: MASIV是一种基于视觉的材料无关系统识别框架，通过可学习的神经构成模型推断物体动力学，无需预定义材料先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义材料先验，限制了处理未知材料的能力。

Method: MASIV采用可学习的神经构成模型，并通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供密集几何指导。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MASIV为材料无关的系统识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 研究如何通过多种策略提升图像编辑任务的性能，并在统一框架下比较这些方法。

Method: 采用自回归多模态模型处理文本和视觉标记，结合监督微调、强化学习和链式思考推理三种策略。

Result: 强化学习结合多模态LLM验证器效果最好，EARL模型在多种编辑任务上表现优异，且训练数据需求较低。

Conclusion: EARL模型推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的前沿，相关代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了UniEgoMotion模型，用于解决第一人称视角下的运动生成与预测问题，通过头中心运动表示和视觉输入实现了统一框架，并在新数据集EE4D-Motion上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升AR/VR体验、改进人机交互、推动辅助技术和自适应医疗解决方案，但现有方法局限于第三人称视角和结构化3D场景，难以适应第一人称视角的动态场景。

Method: 提出UniEgoMotion，一种基于条件运动扩散模型的统一框架，采用头中心运动表示，利用第一人称视觉输入进行运动重建、预测和生成。

Result: UniEgoMotion在第一人称运动重建中表现最优，并首次实现单张第一人称图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新基准，拓展了相关应用的可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的半监督异常检测框架，适用于跨领域应用，尤其在脑MRI数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等问题，特别是在脑MRI异常检测中的应用。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺和大规模数据，预处理包括归一化、去颅骨和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上AUROC达88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），工业数据集上表现同样优秀。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适合实际临床应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在性能和保真度之间存在权衡，且存在效率低下或语义失真的问题。研究发现颜色在信息传递和语义表示中的双重作用被忽视。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型增强图像颜色多样性。

Result: 实验证明DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且生成的压缩数据集可用于训练网络而不引发模型崩溃。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿显著提升了数据集压缩的质量和实用性，是首个利用预训练扩散模型优化压缩数据的研究。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在语言引导的场景交互中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制采用统一标准，未能考虑用户个体差异（如年龄、心理健康、个人信仰等），导致安全边界多样性的忽视。

Method: 提出PSA框架，将个性化用户配置文件集成到扩散过程中，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为。

Result: 实验表明，PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面优于现有方法，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA通过个性化安全对齐有效提升生成内容的安全性和用户满意度，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化需求上的不足。

Method: 结合语言控制分割策略（LS）和窗口控制细化策略（WR），通过潜在扩散模型实现图像条件掩码生成。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，F_β^ω增益达4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在精度和用户控制方面表现出色，适用于高精度个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

TL;DR: EgoTrigger利用音频线索智能激活摄像头，显著降低能耗，同时保持人类记忆增强功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全天智能眼镜在连续感知和AI代理集成中的能源效率问题。

Method: 结合轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类器，通过音频触发图像捕捉。

Result: 平均减少54%的帧数，显著节能，性能与任务相当。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种高效节能的解决方案。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Motivation: 解决场景文本识别中复杂视觉表现和有限语义先验的挑战。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，TEACH训练的模型准确率显著提升，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，模型无关且易于集成，验证了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大量轨迹时计算成本高，尤其是基于Transformer的迭代跟踪和相关性特征计算成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 采用粗到细策略，从小规模点集开始跟踪，逐步扩展轨迹，并使用可学习的插值模块初始化新轨迹；优化相关性特征计算以减少成本。

Result: 算法在保持高精度的同时，速度比现有方法快5-100倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了计算瓶颈，显著提升了密集长期3D点跟踪的效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角图像稀疏且无真实姿态时的3D重建问题。

Method: 使用共享特征提取主干，同时预测3D高斯基元和相机姿态，结合渲染损失和重投影损失优化。

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

*Xinhang Wan,Dongqiang Gou,Xinwang Liu,En Zhu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过学习感知3D表示和分阶段推理策略，解决了3D功能区域定位和分类任务依赖性问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D功能区域定位和分类任务中依赖关系建模不足、预测不完整和尺度固定问题。

Method: 开发跨模态3D表示，结合多尺度几何特征传播和两阶段预测机制，耦合定位与分类任务。

Result: 实验表明，方法在功能区域定位和分类任务中性能均有提升。

Conclusion: 新方法通过建模任务依赖性和多尺度处理，有效提升了3D功能区域的理解能力。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

*Zhan Shi,Song Wang,Junbo Chen,Jianke Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D体素占用的视觉定位新基准和模型GroundingOcc，用于更精确地捕捉户外场景中的物体细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉定位依赖边界框，无法捕捉细粒度细节，导致物体表示不准确。

Method: 在nuScenes数据集上构建3D占用基准，提出多模态学习模型GroundingOcc，结合视觉、文本和点云特征进行从粗到细的预测。

Result: GroundingOcc在3D占用定位任务上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 新基准和模型为户外场景中的精确物体感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Method: 收集3000多张卫星图像，结合TxDOT的PMIS数据库，使用深度学习模型分析。

Result: 准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: 卫星图像与深度学习结合为未来路面评估提供了快速、经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RoadMamba的方法，结合局部和全局感知，用于道路表面分类任务，通过DualSSM和DAF实现特征提取与融合，并在大规模数据集上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉技术提前获取道路表面条件对自动驾驶车辆的安全性和驾驶舒适性至关重要，但现有Mamba架构在局部纹理提取方面表现不足。

Method: 利用DualSSM提取全局语义和局部纹理，通过DAF解码和融合双特征，并引入双辅助损失约束网络。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模数据集上，RoadMamba达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合局部和全局感知，显著提升了道路表面分类任务的效果。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

### [225] [StyDeco: Unsupervised Style Transfer with Distilling Priors and Semantic Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01215)
*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StyDeco的无监督框架，通过针对风格迁移任务学习文本表示，解决了扩散模型中文本驱动机制的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在风格迁移中占主导地位，但其文本驱动机制将文本描述视为统一的指导，忽略了文本描述的非空间性与视觉风格的空间属性之间的语义差距，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: StyDeco框架包括Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）和Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD）。PGD通过冻结生成模型自动合成伪配对数据，CSD则通过领域特定权重调整文本编码器，实现语义空间的两类聚类。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法，并支持独特的去风格化过程。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了文本驱动风格迁移的局限性，具有语义保留和扩展性优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

*Bolei Chen,Shengsheng Yan,Yongzheng Cui,Jiaxu Kang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉场景上下文信息增强楼层平面定位（FLoc）的方法，通过无监督学习和聚类约束预训练房间判别器，显著提升了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面定位因重复结构易导致定位模糊，现有方法忽略视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息，本文旨在利用场景布局先验消除定位不确定性。

Method: 提出无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法中以利用场景上下文。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 利用视觉场景上下文信息能有效消除楼层平面定位的模糊性，提升定位性能。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGaFace提出了一种新的3D头部虚拟形象建模框架，通过动态优化几何和纹理属性，解决了传统方法中网格与图像不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯的渲染，但网格与目标图像的不对齐导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: 引入Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry模块确保几何一致性，并提出Latent Texture Attention实现纹理优化。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在高保真头部重建和新视角合成质量上显著提升。

Conclusion: MoGaFace在网格初始化不准确和真实场景下仍能实现高质量的虚拟形象建模。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Eigen Neural Network (ENN)的新架构，通过层共享的、学习的正交特征基重新参数化权重，解决了传统梯度优化中权重结构混乱的问题，提升了特征表示和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNN）的梯度优化过程常导致权重结构混乱，损害特征清晰性和学习动态。本文旨在解决这一基本表示缺陷。

Method: ENN通过层共享的、学习的正交特征基重新参数化权重，强制权重动态解耦和对齐，无需正则化。此外，还提出了无需反向传播的高效本地学习变体ENN-ℓ。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。ENN-ℓ实现了2倍以上的训练加速，且精度超过端到端反向传播。

Conclusion: ENN通过直接解决反向传播的表示缺陷，提供了性能更强、训练更高效的架构范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可逆SNN因严格顺序计算导致的高延迟问题。

Method: 提出ParaRevSNN，设计并行可逆块，保留可逆性同时实现块间并行。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于或匹配标准RevSNN，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

*Xinyu Chen,Haotian Zhai,Can Zhang,Xiupeng Shi,Ruirui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP），通过三个缓存优化原型构建和预测校准，提升了在零样本设置下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的TTA方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存，分别用于原型初始化、视觉与文本信息整合及预测校准。进一步开发了MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MCP和MCP++通过多缓存和跨模态对齐显著提升了测试时间适应的性能。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型在开放集场景中表现不佳，因其隐含类别完整性的假设和视图诱导的静态偏差。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，结合辅助模糊感知网络和HSIC对比去偏模块。

Result: 在多个多视图基准测试中，框架显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多视图开放集学习中的模糊性和视图偏差问题。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像标题减少视觉信息损失，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在高修剪率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包括轻量级标题模型和选择器，生成与问题相关的描述并选择最佳标题，无需人工标注。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的计算成本显著超越现有方法（如FLOPs减少6.5%，性能提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了视觉信息损失问题，为LVLMs的高效应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Motivation: 现实场景中的标签噪声（如移动物体、非朗伯表面和阴影）导致3DGS重建错误，现有方法难以有效分离噪声或需要场景特定的超参数调整。

Method: 提出OCSplats框架，结合混合噪声评估和观察认知校正技术，设计动态锚点的噪声分类流程。

Conclusion: OCSplats通过创新的噪声分类和校正方法，显著提升了3DGS在噪声场景中的重建效果，且无需调整参数即可适应不同噪声比例的场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Motivation: 现有检测器在未知生成模型下表现不佳，尤其是语义内容接近时。CLIP特征的高层语义信息限制了检测效果。

Method: 提出NS-Net框架，利用NULL-Space投影解耦语义信息，结合对比学习捕捉分布差异，并设计Patch Selection策略保留细粒度特征。

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net检测准确率提升7.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像检测中表现出强泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集像素级标注，成本高且耗时。WSFP旨在通过弱监督降低标注成本。

Method: 提出DisFaceRep框架，结合显式（共现组件解耦）和隐式（文本引导解耦损失）机制分离共现人脸组件。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上，DisFaceRep显著优于现有弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: WSFP任务具有挑战性，但DisFaceRep通过解耦表示有效解决了共现组件模糊性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zihan Li,Wei Sun,Jing Hu,Jianhua Yin,Jianlong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态语义一致性的自增强框架，用于高效图像聚类，通过两阶段方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常冻结预训练模型的编码器，导致任务无关表示与特定聚类任务需求不匹配，限制了性能。

Method: 第一阶段通过跨模态语义一致性训练轻量级聚类头；第二阶段利用自增强微调策略联合优化视觉编码器和聚类头。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型性能甚至超过基于更大ViT-L/14的先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，成功解决了预训练模型与聚类任务的匹配问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

### [238] [SpatioTemporal Difference Network for Video Depth Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01259)
*Zhengxue Wang,Yuan Wu,Xiang Li,Zhiqiang Yan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STDNet的新方法，通过空间和时间差异分支解决视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域存在长尾分布问题，影响重建质量。

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支，分别通过动态对齐RGB特征和传播时间变化信息来解决长尾问题。

Result: 实验证明STDNet在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet有效解决了视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS)方法，通过对抗性损失引导扩散模型生成多样化的蒸馏数据集，解决信息冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法在大规模或高分辨率图像上性能下降，且扩散模型生成的图像多样性不足导致信息冗余。

Method: ACS将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗性损失引导扩散采样过程，减少课程间信息重叠，并逐步生成从简单到复杂的图像。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别取得4.1%和2.1%的性能提升。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗性引导和课程采样，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏噪声和不确定性标注，ModelNet40-E填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过添加高斯噪声参数（σ, μ）生成噪声点云和点级不确定性标注，评估了PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3三种模型。

Result: 所有模型在噪声增加时性能下降，但Point Transformer v3表现出更好的校准性，其预测不确定性更接近实际测量不确定性。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和不确定性建模提供了新的评估工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声环境下表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视频字幕生成方法SGCap，通过语义组解码和关键句子选择模块，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本图像字幕方法直接扩展到视频领域效果不佳，忽略了时间动态性。

Method: 提出语义组解码（SGD）策略，结合关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至接近全监督方法性能。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态性和语义多样性，提升了零样本视频字幕生成的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个基于门控提示调优的框架，用于防止文本到图像（T2I）模型生成不安全内容，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型容易生成不安全内容（如暴力或色情图像），而当前的防御方法计算成本高、适应性差，且可能降低良性图像质量。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全替代文本，构建文本训练语料库，优化通用软提示，并结合门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe在多个基准测试中实现了最低的不安全生成率（2.36%），同时保持了高良性保真度，并展现出强大的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于T2I模型的安全部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督立体匹配框架，通过置信度估计和深度先验损失函数提升匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督立体匹配中多视角一致性假设的模糊性问题，如重复模式和纹理缺失区域。

Method: 提出置信度估计算法和两种深度先验损失函数，利用局部一致性检查构建准密集对应关系。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准测试中达到无监督方法中的最佳匹配精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用3D几何知识，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言模型和多实例学习的框架，通过多智能体生成临床描述和文本编码策略，提升病理图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型生成临床描述或固定长度提示，限制了信息的丰富性和领域特异性，导致视觉特征对齐不佳。

Method: 1. 使用多智能体系统生成基于病理教材的多样化临床描述；2. 采用描述列表而非单一提示的文本编码策略。

Result: 在肾癌和肺癌数据集上表现优于单提示基线，接近最先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过领域知识和多样化描述，显著提升了视觉语言模型在多实例学习中的性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Motivation: 解决合成数据训练的立体匹配模型在真实数据上泛化能力差的问题，避免模型依赖域相关的捷径特征。

Method: 利用RGB空间的均值和标准差作为域特征，通过高斯分布建模扰动方向和强度的不确定性，生成多样化的域样本，并强制原始与增强数据的特征一致性。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，能有效提升模型对域差异的鲁棒性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上AUROC分别达到66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD在多类3D异常检测中表现优异，并能持续适应新类别。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Conclusion: 尽管性能提升，但解剖特异性和临床实用性仍有不足，需进一步改进可解释性方法。

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Result: 显著提升了性能，同时保持了满意的速度。

Conclusion: CSINet通过增强全局和局部语义的利用，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型和统计色彩分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供高效的红斑检测方法。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Method: 通过语义自重建增强风格表达，融合多层图像特征编码风格指纹，并将风格建模为特征空间的最小包围超球边界。

Result: 实验表明，StyleSentinel在单样本验证任务中表现优于现有技术，并在在线平台上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

### [252] [Weakly-Supervised Image Forgery Localization via Vision-Language Collaborative Reasoning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01338)
*Ziqi Sheng,Junyan Wu,Wei Lu,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLaCo是一种视觉-语言协作推理框架，通过利用预训练的视觉-语言模型（VLMs）引入辅助语义监督，仅使用图像级标签实现精确的像素级伪造定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督图像伪造定位（WSIFL）方法依赖图像内一致性线索，缺乏外部语义指导，导致定位性能有限。ViLaCo旨在通过引入VLMs的语义知识弥补这一不足。

Method: ViLaCo结合视觉-语言特征建模网络和自适应推理网络，对齐文本语义与视觉特征，并通过双预测头（图像级分类和像素级定位）实现弱监督到细粒度定位的过渡。此外，引入对比块一致性模块增强伪造特征区分。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，ViLaCo显著优于现有WSIFL方法，在检测和定位精度上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过视觉-语言协作推理有效提升了弱监督下的伪造定位性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: With increasing demand for ride comfort in new energy vehicles, accurate
real-time detection of speed bumps and potholes is critical for predictive
suspension control. This paper proposes SBP-YOLO, a lightweight detection
framework based on YOLOv11, optimized for embedded deployment. The model

by 5.8%) and runs at 139.5 FPS on a Jetson AGX Xavier with TensorRT FP16
quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real-time road
condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频OCL方法在查询预测中忽略了下一帧特征和动态学习，限制了性能。

Method: 设计了新的transitioner，结合slot和特征，并通过随机采样slot-feature对训练以学习动态。

Result: 在对象发现任务上提升高达10分，下游任务如动态建模也受益。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q方法显著优于现有视频OCL方法，提供了更优的对象级表示和动态建模。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵且数据增强工具不足的问题。

Method: 提出3DRot，一种几何一致的旋转和镜像增强方法，同步更新RGB图像、相机参数和3D标注。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升了3D检测的性能指标。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种通用且高效的增强方法，适用于多种3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在HADR中因数据类别不平衡、中度损伤样本稀缺及人工标注不准确而难以泛化，需改进。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）融合图像与人类知识，生成多样化损伤数据。

Result: 初步实验显示生成的数据质量良好，提升了不同结构损伤场景的分类效果。

Conclusion: VLMs为HADR中的损伤评估提供了有效的数据生成和分类改进方法。

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Conclusion: TOPICS+方法在手术场景中表现更鲁棒，为类增量语义分割提供了新的解决方案和基准测试。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion有效结合了两种表示的优势，提升了自动驾驶任务的性能，且地图扩散模块可推广到其他方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Conclusion: FWA和LOLViT有效解决了计算饱和问题，平衡了计算效率与模型性能。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly

estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on

applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

*Zhuohua Ye,Liming Zhang,Hongru Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间和频率域协同的RAW图像目标检测增强框架（SFAE），通过频率域特征恢复被抑制的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW图像，难以有效恢复因动态范围和线性响应而丢失的细节。

Method: 将频率域特征逆变换为空间映射，开发跨域融合注意力模块，并自适应调整空间和频率域的非线性参数。

Result: SFAE框架能够有效恢复RAW图像中被抑制的细节，提升目标检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合空间和频率域特征，SFAE为RAW图像目标检测提供了新的增强方法。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时响应、物理可行性和安全性之间的冲突，提升人机交互的沉浸感和物理合理性。

Method: 采用自回归反应扩散规划器实时预测动作与反应，并结合强化学习的运动跟踪策略动态适应交互伙伴动作。

Result: 在Inter-X和InterHuman数据集上，运动质量、交互连续性和物理合理性显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Human-X框架在虚拟现实和机器人交互中展示了潜力，为人机协作提供了新方向。

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Result: 在两大基准测试中验证了ForenX的有效性，主观评估确认了其解释能力。

Conclusion: ForenX在检测和解释AI生成图像方面表现出色，少量人工标注显著提升了解释质量。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件的单积分（ESI）方法，用于高效实时重建强度图像，适用于无人机视觉跟踪等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和高时间分辨率等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息是实现其潜力的关键。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法，实现实时高帧率（100 FPS）的强度图像重建。

Result: ESI在运行时效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，显著提升了无人机在恶劣视觉环境下的感知能力。

Conclusion: ESI方法在低光照条件下表现出色，适合无人机机载视觉跟踪等实时应用。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

TL;DR: SPECTRUM是一种时频协同模型，通过多域表示学习提升在线手写验证性能，结合时域和频域特征，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线手写验证（OHV）方法仅使用时域特征，未能充分利用频域信息的潜力，限制了性能提升。

Method: SPECTRUM包含多尺度交互器、自门控融合模块和多域距离验证器，协同实现时频特征的微观到宏观整合。

Result: 实验表明SPECTRUM性能优于现有OHV方法，验证了多域学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 多域学习不仅提升了OHV性能，还为跨特征和生物特征域的研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Conclusion: 通过多粒度分解的统一表示，模型成功提升了高光谱图像恢复的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Conclusion: Can3Tok为下游生成任务（如图像到3DGS、文本到3DGS）提供了有效支持。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，缩小了与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream通过轻量级设计和潜在全景预测任务，有效提升了单目输入在VLN任务中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast

interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: 在标准基准测试中性能媲美当前最优模型，同时降低设备功耗41.1%。

Conclusion: MagicVL-2B为移动设备上的视觉语言应用提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

*Zeyu Xu,Junkang Zhang,Qiang Wang,Yi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-VRAG是一种高效视频检索增强生成框架，通过分层查询分解和轻量级VLM评分，显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间难以平衡，尤其是处理复杂视频内容时。

Method: 提出E-VRAG框架，包括帧预过滤、轻量级VLM评分、全局统计分布检索策略和多视角问答方案。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，E-VRAG减少约70%计算成本，且准确性更高。

Conclusion: E-VRAG在视频RAG任务中有效提升了效率和准确性，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩比方法无法适应不同复杂度的场景，导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 提出GlimpsePrune框架，基于人类认知启发，动态剪枝无关视觉标记。

Result: 剪枝92.6%视觉标记，性能与基线相当；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线110%。

Conclusion: 为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）的适应方法需要人工设计，耗时且依赖经验，因此需要自动化优化方法。

Method: 采用两阶段LLM辅助进化算法，优化特征选择和logits计算，并通过低精度代码转换、基于Web的代码执行和过程监控提升搜索效率。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类任务中，EvoVLMA发现的算法比传统方法（如APE）提升了1.91个百分点的识别准确率。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型的适应算法自动化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史感知的自适应扫描框架，通过预测感兴趣区域（ROI）来减少LiDAR的冗余扫描，显著降低能耗，同时保持3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略了时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗过高，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级预测网络和可微分掩码生成器，利用历史时空上下文预测ROI，并通过Gumbel-Softmax采样生成二进制掩码指导稀疏扫描。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，能耗降低65%以上，3D物体检测性能与传统密集扫描方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LiDAR冗余扫描问题，显著提升了能效，同时保持了检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户有权撤回数据，并完全消除其对训练模型的影响，这对ViTs提出了新挑战。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs的核心特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码图像生成正对数，原始图像生成负对数，实现特定数据遗忘。

Result: LetheViT在实验中表现优异，有效平衡隐私合规性与模型效能。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的数据遗忘解决方案，满足隐私法规要求，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TopoImages的新方法，通过编码图像局部拓扑结构来增强深度学习框架对拓扑特征的敏感性，显著提升了医学图像分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像处理中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通性和环）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部拓扑特征，生成多通道的TopoImage表示，并通过多视角TopoImages与输入图像融合，用于深度学习分类。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上的实验表明，TopoImages方法显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法为图像数据分析提供了新视角，能够无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探索CLIP中丰富的文本语义先验在持续学习中的潜力，解决现有方法因忽略语义相关性而导致的干扰问题。

Method: 提出SECA框架，包含SG-AKT模块（基于文本线索评估新图像与历史知识的相关性）和SE-VPR模块（利用文本嵌入优化视觉原型）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SECA的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过结合文本语义先验，显著提升了持续学习的性能，平衡了稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注数据导致领域偏差和低效部署，而现有零样本方法因粗粒度估计和开环流程限制了性能提升。

Method: EgoLoc通过自适应采样策略生成视觉提示，结合2D和3D观测，利用3D手部速度采样高质量初始猜测，并通过闭环反馈优化结果。

Result: 在公开数据集和新基准测试中，EgoLoc优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EgoLoc在自我中心视频的时序交互定位中表现出高效性和准确性，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域泛化（DG）假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但视觉基础模型（VFMs）的出现使这一假设过时。SPL旨在重新定义领域迁移任务，以适应现代研究和应用需求。

Method: SPL提出动态适应和VFM中心调优两个关键特性，并设计了动态提示微调方法，结合动态类感知提示器和提示引导特征聚焦器。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，特别是在广义分割任务中。

Conclusion: SPL通过动态适应和VFM中心调优，为领域泛化提供了更灵活和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成连续时间动态和随机运动序列时存在困难，且容易忽视复杂人体运动的灵活性并导致模式崩溃。

Method: STCN分为两阶段：第一阶段通过时空连续网络生成更平滑的运动序列，并引入锚点集防止模式崩溃；第二阶段利用锚点集学习运动序列的高斯混合分布，并通过多序列采样缓解类内差异。

Result: 在两个数据集（Human3.6M和HumanEva-I）上，STCN在多样性和准确性方面均表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集策略，有效解决了随机人体运动预测中的关键问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私保护的终身行人重识别方法Pr^2R，通过将信息压缩到像素空间，避免存储原始数据，同时提升重放样本的代表性。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有重放方法在隐私保护和性能之间的权衡问题，避免存储历史样本带来的隐私风险。

Method: 通过将多个真实图像的特征压缩到单个图像中，实现像素级变化，并在重放阶段进行双重对齐以缓解遗忘和领域偏移。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pr^2R比现有方法在顺序任务上准确率提高了4%和6%。

Conclusion: Pr^2R在保护隐私的同时显著提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练的正常数据特征，而SNARM通过动态优化和自参考学习，增强异常判别能力。

Method: 计算测试图像与训练特征库的‘间残差’，利用低残差区域作为自生成参考，计算‘内残差’，并通过多头Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态导航机制，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计实现了高效的时空多模态跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Method: 设计多模态课程测量器和类别分布引导的训练调度器，逐步适应不平衡分布。

Result: 在多个多模态医学数据集上表现优于现有方法，并能轻松集成到其他模型中。

Conclusion: CLIMD为提升多模态疾病诊断准确性提供了有效途径，代码已开源。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

TL;DR: FG-PAN是一种针对数字病理学的零样本分类框架，通过局部特征优化和细粒度文本描述生成模块，提升了脑肿瘤亚型分类的准确性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤亚型分类中因形态学差异细微和标注数据稀缺导致的挑战，提升零样本分类性能。

Method: FG-PAN包含局部特征优化模块（建模空间关系）和细粒度文本描述生成模块（利用大语言模型生成语义原型），通过视觉与语义空间对齐增强分类能力。

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上，FG-PAN实现了最先进的零样本分类性能。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过结合视觉与语义信息，显著提升了脑肿瘤亚型分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

*Yiheng Li,Zichang Tan,Zhen Lei,Xu Zhou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IAPL的新框架，通过自适应模块提升对未知生成器的假图像检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练数据范围窄的情况下难以泛化到未知生成器，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: IAPL包含两个模块：条件信息学习器和置信驱动自适应预测，前者学习伪造和图像特定条件，后者优化浅层可学习标记并选择高置信度视图。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应调整输入图像的提示，显著提升了检测性能，适用于多种伪造图像。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像地理定位在危机响应、数字取证和基于位置的情报中具有重要应用，但LLMs在此任务中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过IMAGEO-Bench基准，评估了10种最先进的LLMs在三个不同数据集上的准确性、距离误差、地理偏见和推理过程。

Result: 闭源模型表现更好，但存在地理偏见（高资源地区表现更优），成功定位依赖于识别城市环境、户外场景和地标。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严格评估，并为构建地理定位感知的AI系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC标准虽然通用且低功耗，但压缩效率不及深度学习方法。为了在不牺牲其优势的情况下提升性能，作者提出了这一框架。

Method: 结合压缩导向的体素化网络和可微G-PCC替代模型，通过联合优化实现端到端梯度传播。体素化网络支持全局缩放、细粒度剪枝和点级编辑。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，显著优于原始G-PCC。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强传统压缩标准提供了实用路径，同时保持向后兼容性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CDSR的双尺度重建框架，通过选择性采样和高分辨率补丁，显著提升了全切片图像分析的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）分析面临高分辨率和稀疏诊断区域的挑战，现有方法因特征提取器的领域差距和冗余补丁导致性能下降。

Method: CDSR采用两阶段选择性采样策略和局部到全局网络，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可重建WSI表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CDSR以极少的补丁数量（平均7070个）实现了6.3%的准确率和5.5%的ROC曲线下面积提升。

Conclusion: CDSR在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，为WSI分析提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer

from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型提取通用可供性知识，显著提升了3D可供性预测的泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用，且缺乏几何可解释性。

Method: VELA通过点提示构建初始水平集函数，并通过形状特定运动场逐步演化成最终掩码。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VELA优于现有方法，仅需单点提示。

Conclusion: VELA证明了弱提示下可解释几何建模的有效性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状感知的动态路由和轻量级专家设计，有效解决了模态分割中的遮挡和形状多样性问题，具有较高的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VFM在语义分割中面临的数据规模差异和域分布偏移两大挑战。

Method: 提出Rein++框架，包含Rein-G（域泛化）和Rein-A（域适应）。Rein-G通过实例感知令牌优化特征，Rein-A在实例和逻辑层面进行无监督域适应，并引入语义转移模块。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一种高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,

*Shai Kimhi,Avi Mendlson,Moshe Kimhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchMap是首个空间详尽的对抗补丁放置基准，揭示了小补丁在特定区域能显著降低模型置信度，并提出了一种无需梯度查询的分割引导放置方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需系统性研究补丁放置的影响。

Method: 通过1.5亿次前向传播评估ImageNet验证图像，构建PatchMap基准；提出基于现成分割掩模的放置启发式方法。

Result: PatchMap揭示了补丁放置的系统性热点区域；提出的方法在五种架构上攻击成功率提升8-13%。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其方法为位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

*Zhaochen Wang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image方法通过将文本指令嵌入图像中，统一视觉通道处理信息，减少了多模态对齐的挑战。该方法在Qwen2.5-VL上表现优异，但在LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP上效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐困难导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL性能提升（POPE准确率提高4.1%），而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能显著下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法对某些VLMs有效，但效果因模型架构（如CLIP编码器）而异，需针对性优化。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo3D提出了一种新框架，通过将3D一致性先验知识蒸馏到2D编辑器中，解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题，并在编辑质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现出色，但扩展到3D编辑时，多视角一致性难以保持，现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊伪影等问题。

Method: DisCo3D首先通过多视角输入微调3D生成器以适应场景，然后通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后通过高斯泼溅将编辑后的多视角输出优化为3D表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，DisCo3D在多视角一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D通过一致性蒸馏和高斯泼溅优化，有效解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题，提升了编辑质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptReg方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化图像配准步骤，利用预训练分割模型实现无需训练的配准，并在多种医学和非医学图像上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统区域级对应表示需要两步（分割和匹配），效率较低。本文旨在简化为一直接搜索对应提示的步骤，提高配准效率和精度。

Method: 提出“对应提示问题”，通过“逆向提示”解决方案生成主提示和辅助提示，并设计新算法通过边缘化提示和空间维度识别多对ROI。

Result: 在3D前列腺MR、3D腹部MR、3D肺部CT等五种应用中，PromptReg在Dice和目标配准误差上优于传统和基于学习的方法，甚至接近需要全分割数据的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过直接搜索对应提示简化配准流程，无需训练且性能优越，为图像配准提供了高效新思路。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在基于首尾帧和文本提示生成平滑且合理的过渡视频方面研究不足。

Method: 引入插值初始化、双方向运动微调和表示对齐正则化，优化预训练图像到视频扩散模型。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中表现优异，覆盖概念混合和场景过渡任务。

Conclusion: VTG在过渡视频生成任务中表现卓越，为未来研究提供了统一基准。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

TL;DR: TimeExpert是一种基于Mixture-of-Experts的视频大语言模型，通过动态路由任务特定令牌到专业专家，提升视频时间定位任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型对所有任务令牌采用静态处理路径，无法区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等不同任务的需求。

Method: 提出TimeExpert，利用MoE架构动态路由任务特定令牌（如时间戳、显著性分数）到专业专家，提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，TimeExpert在密集视频描述、时刻检索和视频高光检测等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Result: 实验证明LT-Gaussian能高效更新地图，处理环境变化，并生成更高质量的重建结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，优于从零重建的策略，代码已开源。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAID框架通过帧级门控融合和方向性自适应语义扰动，优化了文本-视频检索的多模态表示，实现了高效且鲁棒的跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉线索，忽略了音频语义或采用粗粒度融合策略，导致多模态表示不理想。

Method: GAID包含两个关键组件：帧级门控融合（FGF）和方向性自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别用于细粒度对齐和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了最先进的检索性能，并显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: GAID通过融合和扰动互补，实现了更稳定和表达力强的多模态表示。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适应的有效性，Conformer模型在基于关键点的CSLR中实现了新SOTA性能。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing

video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments
labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting,
Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results
highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more
sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg

Result: GCC方法在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其多功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: GCC是首个能在细粒度水平上识别与特定视觉概念相关电路的方法，为模型提供了深度的概念级解释。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

Motivation: 无人机视频中的视角变化和复杂运动导致跟踪不稳定，现有方法未能充分利用外观和运动的时空交互。

Method: 提出AMOT，包含外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），联合利用外观和运动线索。

Result: 在VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV三个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT通过外观和运动的联合建模，显著提升了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Result: SpectralX显著提升了领域泛化性能，能够适应新区域或季节的光谱图像。

Conclusion: SpectralX为多光谱/高光谱数据的处理提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

Conclusion: 强调需要在整个模型生命周期中开发防御措施，以保护微调后的专有模型免受基础模型漏洞的影响。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

### [323] [Intention-Guided Cognitive Reasoning for Egocentric Long-Term Action Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01742)
*Qiaohui Chu,Haoyu Zhang,Meng Liu,Yisen Feng,Haoxiang Shi,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT是一个两阶段框架，通过提取手-物体交互特征和强化学习模块，解决了长期动作预测中的视觉线索、语义依赖和认知推理问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作预测在人机交互和辅助技术中至关重要，但现有方法在视觉线索利用、语义依赖和认知推理方面存在不足。

Method: INSIGHT分为两阶段：第一阶段提取手-物体交互特征并利用动词-名词共现矩阵增强动作表示；第二阶段通过强化学习模块模拟认知推理（感知->推理->预测）。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA Gaze+基准测试中，INSIGHT取得了最先进的性能，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合视觉特征提取和认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

*Runkai Zheng,Vishnu Asutosh Dasu,Yinong Oliver Wang,Haohan Wang,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程并减少差分隐私噪声的影响，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习依赖大量敏感数据，隐私保护至关重要。差分隐私数据生成虽有效但成本高，数据集蒸馏（DD）效率高但现有方法存在噪声问题和同步采样优化的低效性。

Method: 提出新框架，解耦采样与优化，通过在信息子空间中匹配减少差分隐私噪声的影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，且仅需先前方法五分之一的蒸馏集大小即可提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的效率与性能，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

TL;DR: EST-LoRA是一种无需训练的LoRA融合方法，通过综合考虑矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，自适应选择主题和风格LoRA，实现平衡生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡主题和风格，且需要额外训练或涉及复杂超参数。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA，基于能量、风格差异和时间步长自适应选择LoRA，类似MoE架构。

Result: 实验表明，EST-LoRA在质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA是一种高效且无需训练的LoRA融合方法，显著提升生成效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种多摄像头实时追踪系统，用于监测奶牛活动，结合计算机视觉技术，显著提升了追踪准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利密切相关，但人工监测费时且不一致，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型和SAMURAI进行实例分割与追踪，通过运动感知算法处理遮挡和姿态变化。

Result: 系统在多目标追踪准确率（MOTA）和身份一致性（IDF1）上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时监测复杂环境中的奶牛活动，有望通过行为量化提升疾病早期预测能力。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉提示的导航方法（VPN），通过用户提供的2D俯视图标记导航轨迹，避免了语言指令的模糊性和冗长性，更适合非专业用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在指导具身代理导航时存在模糊性和冗长性问题，影响了导航效果。

Method: 提出视觉提示导航（VPN）范式，使用2D俯视图标记导航轨迹；构建了两个新数据集R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP；设计了VPNet网络，并采用视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略。

Result: 实验评估了视觉提示形式、俯视图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN通过视觉提示提供直观且空间明确的导航指导，减少了语言指令的模糊性，适合非专业用户。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

Motivation: 减少肝脏手术规划中对血管结构先验知识的依赖，提高分割效率。

Method: 使用3D点表示CT图像，加入图推理模块学习点邻域间的亲和性，隐式学习肝脏血管结构。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离得分优于四种点基方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过隐式学习血管结构，实现了高效的Couinaud分割，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种帧级重建方法的性能，在现有基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合物理知识和扩散模型，有效提升了3D手部运动的恢复精度和一致性。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，通过解耦-增强-融合范式解决事件数据的时空不均匀性问题，无需任务特定设计即可在多任务中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据因其非结构化分布和时空不均匀性，通常需要任务特定设计，限制了现有架构的复用性。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空域特征，利用空间填充曲线扩大感受野并提升效率，最后通过注意力融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集上，OmniEvent比任务特定SOTA方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent首次实现了事件数据的统一表示学习，为多任务处理提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在严重的物体幻觉问题，研究发现其原因是模态偏差，即模型难以同时关注视觉和文本模态。作者提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整注意力权重和对比解码策略来缓解幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在理解和推理方面表现出色，但仍存在物体幻觉问题。传统观点认为这是由于视觉编码器与大型语言模型（LLMs）规模不匹配导致的，但研究发现模态偏差（忽略视觉和文本模态）是更深层次的原因。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过干预和调整视觉与文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数化知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证实模态偏差在LVLMs中普遍存在，所提方法在多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 模态偏差是LVLMs物体幻觉的关键原因，提出的方法具有通用性和高效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在抽象场景和固定搜索路径下进行，忽略了现实场景特性，因此需要验证方法在自由视觉搜索中的适用性。

Method: 采用36名参与者的用户研究，使用140个现实场景（如桌面图标和工具搜索），结合眼动和EEG特征进行分类。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在现实场景中区分目标与非目标注视点的可行性，为辅助系统提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF 不仅提升了检测准确性，还提供了细粒度的伪造定位，验证了其整体有效性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Result: 在流式和长视频理解任务中，方法在响应准确性和实时效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种公开可访问的DICOM数据集（MIDI）和评估框架，用于标准化医学图像去标识化流程，以解决隐私保护和数据共享的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像研究依赖大规模数据共享，但患者隐私保护是主要挑战。现有去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法，影响可重复性和监管信心。

Method: 开发了包含合成PHI/PII的DICOM数据集（MIDI），并设计了评估框架，包括Python脚本、答案键和映射文件，支持自动化评估。

Result: MIDI数据集包含538名受试者、53,581个DICOM图像实例，覆盖多种设备和癌症类型。评估框架符合HIPAA和DICOM标准。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学图像去标识化提供了客观、标准化的评估工具，有助于更安全、一致的数据共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InspectVLM，基于Florence-2的统一视觉语言模型，在工业检测中表现不如传统ResNet模型，存在提示变异性低、细粒度检测退化等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业检测中的可行性，以简化多任务视觉流程。

Method: 使用InspectVLM（基于Florence-2）和InspectMM数据集进行测试。

Result: InspectVLM在分类和关键点任务中表现尚可，但在核心检测指标上不及ResNet，且存在提示敏感性和退化问题。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉基础和鲁棒性上不足，难以满足高精度工业检测需求。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络和生成式AI易受后门攻击，传统方法难以检测多触发器和未见配置的攻击。

Method: DBOM利用视觉语言模型分解输入表示，通过视觉提示库和提示前缀调优分离触发器和对象表示，引入分离和多样性损失。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上实验表明，DBOM能鲁棒检测中毒图像，提升DNN训练安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为对抗性攻击模式提供了新见解，显著增强了DNN训练管道的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Motivation: 减少对大规模标注数据的依赖，利用无标签数据提升目标检测器的性能。

Method: 采用SimCLR框架预训练YOLOv5和YOLOv8的卷积骨干网络，使用全局池化和投影头，优化对比损失，并在有限标注数据上微调。

Result: SSL预训练显著提升了mAP、收敛速度和精度-召回性能，尤其在低标注数据情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: 对比SSL为单阶段检测器提供了高效利用无标签数据的基线方法，展示了其在标签高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Motivation: 现有NLOS成像方法因三维建模导致高计算成本和内存消耗，限制了实际应用和轻量设备的实时高分辨率成像。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，并通过Quasi-Fresnel变换建立测量数据与隐藏场景的直接反演公式。

Result: 相比现有方法，计算时间和内存需求降低多个数量级，同时保持成像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有望实现实时高分辨率NLOS成像，并扩展其在轻量设备上的应用范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Result: 在三个图像生成任务上的实验表明，该方法在忠实反映图像提示方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过冲突自由引导和分层注意力，论文成功解决了图像提示生成中的关键问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和一致性。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Motivation: 当前ADVLMs的评估主要基于静态输入的开放环境，缺乏对交互行为和实际安全性的闭环评估。

Method: 通过双系统适应架构将ADVLMs适配到仿真环境，并设计物理控制抽象层实现仿真与现实的闭环测试。

Result: 实验表明现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下的性能有限。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLMs提供了全面的闭环评估方法，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对面部识别技术滥用导致的隐私问题，如未经同意的身份推断和数字足迹暴露。

Method: 将用户的3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然3D面具，应用于在线分享前。

Result: 显著降低黑盒面部识别模型的检索准确率，性能至少优于现有方法2倍，并提供视觉一致性。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在放疗剂量预测中的泛化性、准确性和临床适用性不足的问题。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和渐进噪声去噪框架，通过多头注意力机制和复合损失函数优化预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAE为0.101-0.154，DICE系数提升6.8%，规划时间降至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了通用且高效的解决方案，显著提升了临床效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

Method: 从Mapillary数据集中提取并手动标注细粒度交通标志类别，创建MVV数据集，并对比DINOv2与多种VLM模型的性能。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2为自动驾驶场景中的细粒度视觉理解提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法在时空相关性和时间一致性上的不足，提升3D姿态估计的精度和连贯性。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散框架和时空引导机制，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化放射学报告生成（S-RRG）的新方法，包括数据集构建、模型训练和新的评估框架，以提高报告的临床相关性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，结构化报告（S-RRG）能提供标准化和简洁的信息，但现有方法依赖预定义标签或模板，限制了表达性和临床细节的完整性。

Method: 构建了一个胸部X光数据集（MIMIC-STRUC），训练了一个基于LLM的模型生成标准化报告，并提出了新的评估指标（S-Score）以衡量疾病预测和细节准确性。

Result: 提出的方法生成了高质量的标准化报告，并通过S-Score验证了其在临床决策中的有效性，与人类评估更一致。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制化的评估指标（S-Score）显著提升了放射学报告的质量和临床相关性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在动态时空交互理解上存在显著缺陷，无法像人类一样轻松追踪和推理物体运动、旋转和视角变化。

Method: 设计了VLM4D基准测试，包含多样化的真实和合成视频及精心设计的问题-答案对，评估VLMs在平移、旋转、视角感知和运动连续性上的表现。

Result: 现有VLMs在时空推理能力上表现显著低于人类基线，尤其在整合多视觉线索和保持时间一致性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 通过4D特征场重建和时空监督微调等方法，可以提升VLMs的时空理解能力，为动态环境下的视觉智能发展铺路。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合解决分布式开源LoRA模块的三大挑战，显著提升图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3等大规模模型在逼真图像生成方面取得进展，但其实际部署仍受参数微调难的限制。LoRA虽能低成本定制模型，但面临元数据稀疏、零样本适应需求和多LoRA融合策略不佳的挑战。

Method: 框架包含两部分：(1)基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示的共享语义空间；(2)细粒度门控融合机制，动态计算多LoRA模块在生成时的最优融合权重。

Result: 显著提升了图像生成性能，支持基础模型的高效扩展。

Conclusion: 该工作为社区开发的LoRA碎片化场景与实际部署需求搭建桥梁，通过标准化适配器集成推动协作模型进化。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

TL;DR: DeflareMamba利用状态空间模型高效序列建模能力，提出分层框架解决镜头光晕去除问题，保持局部-全局依赖关系，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光与镜头复杂交互导致信息混淆，现有方法难以保持上下文一致性。

Method: 设计分层框架，通过变步长采样建立长程像素关联，并采用局部增强状态空间模型保留细节。

Result: 有效去除多种光晕伪影，保持非光晕区域自然外观，提升下游视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: 首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，实验验证其优越性，代码开源。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

TL;DR: NRE-Net利用单目RGB图像预测的法线图、RGB图像和事件流三种模态，通过自适应融合模块提升恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下的物体检测对自动驾驶等应用至关重要，但现有方法（如RGB或事件数据）难以应对反射干扰，且缺乏多模态融合的解决方案。

Method: 提出NRE-Net框架，融合法线图、RGB图像和事件流，并设计ADFM和EAFM模块优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net显著优于现有方法，mAP50提升最高达7.9%。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合有效抑制误检，提升检测精度，为恶劣光照条件下的物体检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Motivation: 当前基于神经辐射场或高斯泼溅的方法在动态场景建模中存在局限性，如依赖预校准物体轨迹或难以处理快速移动物体。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时态一致先验，引入联合时间戳优化策略和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 显著提升动态建模效果，特别是快速移动物体，新视角合成的PSNR提升约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态场景建模中的时态一致性和快速移动物体建模问题。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更准确的评估方法。

Method: 使用多层感知器（MLP）构建神经质量度量，输入为参考和近似BRDF样本，输出为感知质量评分（JOD）。

Result: 新度量方法与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量方法。

Conclusion: 该度量方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，但在BRDF拟合中作为损失函数的性能有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-MLLM因上下文长度限制在长视频场景中表现不佳，常见方法牺牲特征粒度或推理效率。Free-MoRef旨在高效理解长帧输入。

Method: 通过重构视觉标记为多参考短序列，引入MoRef-attention并行收集线索，融合关键标记以补偿跨参考交互。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Free-MoRef实现了对2倍至8倍长输入帧的全面感知，性能超越专用长视频MLLM。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef以低计算成本显著提升了长视频理解能力，展示了高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Result: 航拍图像使地图构建精度提升15-23%，轨迹预测性能提高2%。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展且适应性强的环境信息源，AID4AD数据集已公开以促进相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅需10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在真实场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到无参考分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，显著提升了参考音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持产品一致性的同时，显著优于现有技术，有效整合文本和视觉信息。

Conclusion: DreamPainter通过多模态控制信号解决了电商背景生成的关键问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Conclusion: 统一模型在RGB图像上实现了更高效的检测和姿态估计，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

Motivation: 现有方法常简化光照问题，假设单一光源或均匀光照，无法处理复杂场景中的光照和反射率分离问题。

Method: 提出一种基于Retinex模型的学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度分量指导，实现光照与反射率的精确分解。

Result: 在现有基准和CL3AN数据集上验证了方法的有效性，表现出更强的鲁棒性和较低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂光照和材料反射变化下表现优异，同时保持高效计算性能。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

Motivation: 解决弱监督多模态细粒度时序伪造定位（WS-MTFL）缺乏系统性研究的问题，应对Deepfake视频引发的信任危机。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，结合视觉与音频模态检测任务；引入Mixture-of-Experts结构自适应选择特征与定位头；提出特征增强模块与时序属性保留注意力机制；设计可扩展偏差感知损失函数。

Result: 实验表明WMMT在WS-MTFL中表现优异，多项指标接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: WMMT为弱监督多模态时序伪造定位提供了有效解决方案，展示了多任务学习的潜力。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，尤其是面对域偏移时，而现有TTA方法因依赖梯度反向传播无法适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播，并结合域知识管理方案以减少干扰并促进知识积累。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有最优方法（FOA）提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA为量化模型提供了一种高效且鲁棒的适应方法，显著提升了其在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The
source code is available at https://github.com/DengZeshuai/ZOA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗训练方法RPAT，通过优化感知一致性来缓解准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练（AT）在提升模型鲁棒性的同时会降低干净数据的准确性，作者发现这是由于对难对抗样本的过度学习导致决策边界退化。

Method: 提出了一种名为Robust Perception的新目标，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化，并基于此设计了RPAT方法。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，RPAT优于4种常见基线和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性，有效缓解了准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统Mamba模型内容无关，依赖固定扫描方式，无法动态利用内容依赖关系。

Method: 提出CAM，包括内容感知令牌重组和全局先验集成，优化令牌交互。

Result: CMIC模型在多个基准测试中BD-rate显著优于VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: CAM有效提升全局依赖捕捉能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床应用中持续WSI分析的强大解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

Motivation: 当前扩散变换器在低资源应用中因推理速度慢而受限，现有方法存在内存开销大和固定缓存调度的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，并引入动态缓存机制，根据预测误差决定是否信任泰勒预测。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17x、2.36x和4.14x的加速，且质量下降可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于低资源应用。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Result: 在三个数据集上分别提升3.2%、5.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: I2CR框架显著优于现有方法，解决了多模态实体链接中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DerProp通过导数标签传播有效解决了伪标签不可靠的问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Motivation: 病理学中的视觉语言模型（VLMs）因超高分辨率、复杂组织结构和临床语义的细微差别容易产生幻觉，影响临床信任。现有RAG方法主要依赖文本知识库，无法充分利用视觉线索。

Method: 提出Patho-AgenticRAG，基于权威病理学教科书构建多模态数据库，支持文本-图像联合检索和推理任务分解。

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效减少幻觉，提升病理诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic

TL;DR: SplatSSC提出了一种基于深度引导的初始化策略和高斯聚合器的单目3D语义场景补全框架，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于3D高斯基元的方法中随机初始化导致的效率低下和异常基元引入错误的问题。

Method: 采用深度分支（GMF模块）生成稀疏但具代表性的高斯基元，并通过解耦高斯聚合器（DGA）减少噪声。

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上，IoU和mIoU分别提升6.3%和4.1%，延迟和内存消耗降低9.3%以上。

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导和高效聚合策略，实现了更优的性能和效率。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hermes的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，用于解决超声图像分类和分割任务中伪标签选择过于自信但错误的问题，并通过任务间一致性学习和信息共享模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于置信度的伪标签选择方法容易产生过度自信但错误的预测，影响半监督对比学习性能，同时分类和分割任务间的关系未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Hermes策略，结合对比学习和半监督学习，引入任务间注意力和显著性模块促进信息共享，设计任务间一致性学习策略对齐特征。

Result: 在两个公共和一个私有超声数据集上的实验表明，Hermes在多种半监督设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过改进伪标签选择和任务间协作，显著提升了超声图像分类和分割的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，通过直接匹配高区分度的区域描述符，显著提升了匹配的准确性和效率，同时减少了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM的方法依赖低效的像素级比较和复杂的图匹配，限制了可扩展性。SGAD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SGAD通过生成高区分度的区域描述符实现直接匹配，无需复杂图优化；采用分类和排序子任务的监督策略；引入HCRF消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD在运行时减少60倍（0.82s vs. 60.23s），在户外和室内姿态估计中均表现出更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新的描述符和监督策略，显著提升了区域匹配的性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 研究了边缘增强预训练对医学图像分割模型跨模态性能的影响，并提出了一种基于元学习的策略来选择最佳预训练方式，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量计算资源和数据，现有预训练模型虽能提升性能，但边缘预处理的影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用Kirsch等边缘核预处理数据，训练两种预训练模型（原始数据和边缘增强数据），并通过元学习策略选择最佳模型。

Result: 边缘增强预训练在不同模态中表现不一，元学习策略使整体性能提升16.42%（相比仅边缘增强）和19.30%（相比仅原始数据）。

Conclusion: 边缘增强预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能有效优化跨模态医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高动态场景中存在感知间隙，而事件相机的异步性和高时间分辨率能提供连续运动捕捉，但现有方法依赖同步传感器，限制了性能。

Method: 提出了一种仅使用事件相机的立体3D物体检测框架，引入双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过物体中心信息对齐边界框以增强回归。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，展示了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了事件相机在3D物体检测中的有效性，为高动态场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoMet是一种新的训练策略，通过结合Soft Confident Learning和Meta-Learning，使异常检测模型能够从未经筛选的数据中学习，无需手动标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测需要手动筛选数据，引入偏差且适应性差。CoMet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合Soft Confident Learning（低权重低置信度样本）和Meta-Learning（基于验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的方法，有效解决了数据筛选问题，提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Conclusion: 全身表征学习可作为独立筛查工具或多模态框架的一部分，具有早期个性化风险分层的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗中的应用需要安全机制，尤其是在模型可能误分类时延迟决策给人类专家。现有方法依赖特定训练分布，可能无法应对数据偏移。

Method: 通过大规模眼科数据集，比较学习式延迟模型和不确定性量化方法在分布内外的表现，评估其对青光眼分类和延迟决策的准确性。

Result: 研究发现不确定性量化方法在AI延迟决策中表现更优。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI延迟决策的更稳健选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的约束有效提升了模型性能，证明了符号抽象与现有模型结合的价值。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在复杂文本渲染和图像编辑方面具有显著优势，为多语言和图像生成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控、灵活的说话人脸生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

Conclusion: OTIP在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了重建和编辑性能。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于识别港口物流中的运输单元（TUs），解决了缺乏公开基准数据集的问题，并展示了在不同条件下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中识别运输单元的效率提升受限于缺乏多样化和动态的公开数据集。

Method: 提出了TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道（三阶段：分割、ID文本定位、识别与验证）。

Result: TITUS在不同视角、光照和天气条件下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道为港口数字化转型和物流效率提升提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成和评估框架，解决了布局生成中的任务特定性和评估偏差问题，提升了性能和适用性。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星轨道和成像条件限制下，多尺度目标和动态环境带来的海事监测挑战。

Method: 构建包含1092组多模态图像的数据集，每组合五种模态图像，时空一致且精细标注。

Result: 数据集支持多种遥感任务，实验验证其有效性并揭示未来研究方向。

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集为多模态遥感任务提供了重要支持，并指明了进一步探索的方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

TL;DR: COLER是一种无监督实例分割和目标检测方法，通过CutOnce生成粗伪标签，并利用这些标签训练检测器，无需聚类或复杂后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动无监督目标定位领域的发展，提供一种简单高效的方法。

Method: 使用CutOnce生成伪标签，结合自监督模型的能力，无需聚类或后处理，通过自训练提升性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，表现优异。

Conclusion: COLER是一种零样本无监督模型，具有潜力推动无监督目标定位的进步。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Hydra的创新方法，结合毫米波雷达和摄像头技术，通过卷积神经网络和Transformer编码器检测叶片湿润时间（LWD），在多种环境下表现出高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化且适应性不足，无法直接测量真实叶片或在多变环境中保持鲁棒性。

Method: Hydra结合毫米波雷达与摄像头，使用CNN融合多模态图像，并通过Transformer编码器提取特征，最终分类器检测叶片湿润状态。

Result: Hydra在多种场景下分类叶片湿润的准确率高达96%，在恶劣环境下仍保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra展示了在真实农业环境中高精度检测LWD的潜力，填补了现有技术的应用缺口。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列分析因高维性、动态性和变量间复杂交互而具有挑战性。

Method: 通过超图建模和Transformer架构，HGTS-Former对时间序列数据进行归一化、嵌入和多头自注意力处理，并构建层次超图以捕获变量间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former为解决多变量时间序列分析问题提供了一种新方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的新AI方法，直接从MRI图像预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的总生存期（OS），无需肿瘤分割，简化了流程并降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，生存期预测对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。传统方法依赖肿瘤分割，复杂且资源密集。

Method: 利用ViTs直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免了分割步骤，简化了工作流程。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率为62.5%，在精度、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于现有最佳模型。但因数据集规模限制，ViT的泛化能力受限。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了ViTs在医学影像任务中的适用性，为高效且无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Motivation: 从无声视频中估计语音内容在辅助技术和增强现实中具有重要应用，但由于序列间的变异性和信息分布不均，准确映射唇部动作到单词具有挑战性。

Method: 提出InfoSyncNet，包含非均匀量化模块和多种训练策略，动态调整网络焦点并处理视觉语音数据的不一致性。

Result: 在LRW和LRW1000数据集上分别达到92.0%和60.7%的Top-1准确率，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新的非均匀序列建模和数据增强技术，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

TL;DR: SAMPO通过偏好优化解决SAM模型在密集同质对象分割中的意图差距问题，显著提升稀疏提示下的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM模型在密集同质对象（如生物医学细胞核）分割中无法泛化到用户隐含意图的问题。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化使模型从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，不依赖语言模型。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中表现优异，仅用10%训练数据即超越所有基线方法，性能提升超9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型提供了一种新的意图感知对齐范式，无需依赖辅助提示生成器或语言模型。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore)的新框架，用于多类图像异常检测，满足不同条件下对类标签的需求，并在实验中表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多类图像异常检测模型在单模型处理多类时性能较差，且类信息的使用方式对检测阈值定义的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 提出HierCore框架，利用分层记忆库估计类间决策标准，无需类标签即可有效工作。

Result: 实验验证HierCore在四种不同场景下均满足需求，性能稳定。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类异常检测任务中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: FMS通过综合监督机制，有效提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多镜头重建保真度上优于现有技术，分解和语义字幕显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过明确分解和语义提示，为多镜头fMRI重建建立了新范式，能准确恢复复杂视觉叙事。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

Result: 实验表明EFA-GS显著减少伪影，PSNR提升1.68 dB，同时保留高频细节。

Conclusion: EFA-GS有效解决漂浮伪影问题，并在下游任务中验证了其有效性，代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的光学特性导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，降低了机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性。现有方法依赖模型隐式推断深度值的可靠性，但泛化能力不足。

Method: ReMake利用实例掩码区分透明与非透明区域，结合单目深度估计提供深度上下文，专注于透明区域的深度估计学习。

Result: 实验表明，ReMake在基准数据集和真实场景中均优于现有方法，表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域和提供深度上下文，显著提升了深度补全的准确性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

Motivation: 短视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）的快速增长使得预测视频参与度对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要，但现有方法难以有效建模跨特征和多模态的交互。

Method: 采用两种LMMs模型（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL），分别整合音频、视觉和语言模态或仅视觉和语言模态，并在SnapUGC数据集上训练。

Result: 两种模型在基准测试中表现优异，其中VideoLLaMA2因整合音频特征表现更优，模型集成后在ICCV VQualA 2025挑战赛中取得第一名。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视频参与度预测中具有显著潜力，音频特征的整合对提升性能尤为重要。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了艺术斑马线对预训练视觉行人检测模型的影响，发现复杂图案会降低检测性能，且对抗性设计可操纵检测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线虽提升行人安全，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰依赖视觉的监控系统，需评估其对行人检测的影响。

Method: 通过合成不同街艺图案到固定监控场景，评估模型在正常和对抗性艺术斑马线下的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，对抗性设计可隐藏真实行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调在设计鲁棒模型时需考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别以优化带宽使用和车辆检测精度，提升智能交通系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽限制对实时视频传输和车辆检测精度的影响，适应环境变化。

Method: 使用PAVC框架动态调整压缩级别，基于天气和光照条件优化带宽和检测精度。

Result: PAVC提升检测精度13%，带宽需求减少8.23倍（中等带宽）或72倍（低带宽）。

Conclusion: PAVC有效平衡带宽需求和检测精度，适用于智能交通系统。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

TL;DR: ReMoMask是一个统一的文本到运动生成框架，通过双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力和RAG-无分类器引导三项创新，显著提升了生成运动的多样性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法存在多样性不足、误差累积和物理不合理等问题，ReMoMask旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 1) 双向动量文本-运动模型；2) 语义时空注意力机制；3) RAG-无分类器引导。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准测试中，FID分数分别提升了3.88%和10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过创新设计实现了性能的显著提升，成为文本到运动生成的新标杆。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA评估中依赖点估计，忽视了性能方差的影响，如随机模型输出、训练种子敏感性和超参数配置。

Method: 分析了14个VQA基准的性能方差，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调的影响，并探索了Cloze式评估。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著影响结果可靠性。

Conclusion: 提倡采用方差感知方法，以促进MLLMs的更稳健发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMGS提出了一种基于3D高斯散射的抛体运动重建方法，通过目标建模和运动恢复两阶段流程，结合物理一致性约束和动态学习率策略，显著提升了高速非线性刚体运动的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动态重建方法主要局限于短时间、小尺度的变形，且缺乏物理一致性考虑，PMGS旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: PMGS采用两阶段流程：目标建模（动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制）和运动恢复（学习每帧SE(3)位姿）。引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，并设计卡尔曼融合方案优化误差。

Result: 实验表明，PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过结合物理约束和自适应学习策略，为大规模时空刚体运动重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MedVLThinker，一个开源的医学推理模型构建方法，通过数据筛选和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR），发现RLVR在性能上显著优于SFT，且文本数据训练效果优于多模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏开源且可复现的医学推理模型构建方法，阻碍了社区研究和比较。

Method: 采用系统数据筛选和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR），基于Qwen2.5-VL模型家族进行实验。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，文本数据训练效果更好，7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到新SOTA，32B模型性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 开源数据、模型和代码为医学多模态推理研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Result: 实验表明AugPT提升了模型性能和泛化能力，无需外部知识。

Conclusion: AugPT是一种高效、自包含的提示调优方法，适用于资源有限场景。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学在AI中的重要性日益增长，但其结果难以复现，主要原因是数据科学生命周期中的不确定性。传统统计方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出更新的PCS框架，结合生成式AI，提供了一种原则性方法，并通过案例研究展示其应用。

Result: PCS框架能有效管理数据科学生命周期中的不确定性，案例研究展示了数据清理阶段的选择对预测结果的影响。

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学实践提供了一种可靠的方法，有助于减少不确定性并提高结果的可复现性。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MARS的多智能体强化学习框架，通过风险感知和动态调整来优化投资组合管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习模型在动态市场条件下难以平衡风险与收益，MARS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多智能体集成，每个智能体具有独特的风险偏好，并由Meta-Adaptive Controller动态协调。

Result: 在多个国际股票指数上测试，显著降低了最大回撤和波动率，同时保持竞争力回报。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性而非显式市场特征工程，实现了风险与收益的优越平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

Result: 在Allen-Cahn、Klein-Gordon和Navier-Stokes方程上实验，相对MSE降低达三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了深度学习与物理驱动建模之间的空白，为多尺度和时间依赖的PDE系统提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对无缝互联网接入需求的增长，特别是在交通和偏远地区，卫星连接的可靠性成为关键。移动物体（如飞机）因频繁切换卫星信号而面临挑战。

Method: 通过分析GEO卫星与飞机通信的真实数据集，利用机器学习预测信号质量，并实现主动网络切换。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅适用于飞机，还可扩展到其他移动物体（如车辆、火车），通过定制数据集提升通信效率。

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的无模型方法，用于感应电机的故障诊断，避免了传统方法中复杂的动态建模和信号预处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的诊断方法复杂且计算成本高，难以实现。

Method: 使用GNN直接从原始电流和振动信号中学习特征，无需预处理或手动特征提取。

Result: 在偏心、轴承缺陷和断条故障检测中分别达到92.5%、91.2%和93.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: GNN框架简化了实现，保持了高诊断性能，是传统方法的有力替代。

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Conclusion: 需制定可重复性指南、加强研究者培训，并通过期刊和会议政策提升透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Result: 实验显示开源预训练MVTS插补模型平均幻觉水平高达59.5%，提出的缓解方法可降低47.7%。

Conclusion: 新定义和方法有助于提升MVTS基础模型的采用和安全性。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Motivation: 现有投影松弛方法在解决NP-hard的QAP问题时，会引入数值尺度敏感性和几何不对齐误差，需要一种更有效的松弛框架。

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了现有松弛方法的误差问题，混合精度架构显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Conclusion: 自适应个性化风险检测方法对实时安全反馈和智能交通系统中的驾驶员支持具有重要价值。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Result: 实验表明潜在边距分布与检测器对后处理图像的泛化能力强相关。

Conclusion: 通过选择潜在边距最大的模型变体，可构建更鲁棒的拼接检测器。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer的知识获取和提取提供了理论支持，并解释了相关现象，如学习率调度的作用。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained

activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,

persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Conclusion: PALACE是标准化预测审计的重要第一步，为提升透明度、责任和用户信任提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-10、ImageNet等）上，CaliMatch表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CaliMatch通过校准分类器和OOD检测器，显著提升了半监督学习的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态、自动、系统的红队测试框架（DAS），用于持续评估大型语言模型（LLM）在临床实践中的安全性，揭示了静态基准测试无法捕捉的显著漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM发展迅速，静态安全基准测试容易过时，无法全面评估模型的可信度，尤其是在医疗等高风险领域。

Method: 采用DAS框架，通过对抗性代理动态生成测试用例、识别不安全触发策略并实时评估响应，覆盖鲁棒性、隐私、偏见/公平性和幻觉四个关键领域。

Result: 测试15个LLM显示，静态基准表现与动态测试结果差异显著：94%的正确回答在动态鲁棒性测试中失败，隐私泄露率86%，偏见影响81%，幻觉率66%。

Conclusion: DAS框架为医疗AI提供了动态、可扩展的安全保障，弥补了静态测试的不足，适用于临床实践中的持续监测。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合超图网络（HHN），用于建模时序多模态数据，通过分段和图结构策略解决了现有方法忽略时序依赖和模态间复杂关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序多模态数据（如视听数据）的分类任务面临长时序依赖和跨模态交互的挑战，现有方法多模态独立处理且融合策略浅层，无法捕捉复杂结构关系。

Method: HHN采用分段优先、图结构后续的策略，将序列分割为时间戳节点，通过超边捕捉模态内结构，并利用超图卷积提取高阶依赖；模态间通过时序对齐和图注意力进行语义融合。

Result: HHN在四个多模态数据集上实现了最先进（SOTA）的分类性能。

Conclusion: HHN通过分段和图结构策略有效建模时序多模态数据，显著提升了分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应版本的LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），用于量化特征重要性中的协同效应，通过三个分数（唯一、冗余和协同）分析特征的高阶影响，并与Shapley效应进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征重要性方法仅通过单一分数衡量特征相关性，无法捕捉高阶效应。本文旨在通过Hi-Fi框架更全面地分析特征间的协同与冗余关系。

Method: 提出自适应LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），为每个特征分配三个分数（唯一、冗余、协同），并与Shapley效应进行比较。应用案例为空气污染物与阿尔茨海默病死亡率的关系。

Result: 发现O3和NO2与死亡率之间存在协同效应，尤其是在Bergamo和Brescia地区；城市绿地密度也与污染物协同影响死亡率预测。

Conclusion: Hi-Fi作为一种广泛适用的工具，为XAI和复杂系统的高阶关系分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法忽略了丰富的海洋领域知识，限制了预测精度的进一步提升。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），利用图嵌入网络学习其语义和结构知识，并与数值SST数据及预训练大语言模型融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，OKG-LLM表现优于现有方法，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM为SST预测提供了新思路，有望推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

Motivation: 在机器学习中，特征选择旨在减少特征数量以提高模型效率和准确性。现有方法在特征减少和计算效率方面仍有改进空间。

Method: FeatureCuts结合过滤排名和自适应特征截断选择，优化特征子集。在公开和行业数据集上验证其性能。

Result: 相比现有方法，FeatureCuts平均减少15%的特征和99.6%的计算时间，同时保持性能。与PSO结合时，进一步减少25%的特征和66%的计算时间。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts是一种高效、可扩展的特征选择算法，适用于企业级大规模数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLM在通用嵌入任务中的高效适应提供了有效路径，显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Motivation: 现有方法在异构数据源融合中存在统一表示框架缺失、数据压缩的可扩展性和存储问题，以及跨任务泛化的不灵活性。

Method: U^2QT采用两阶段架构：1) 因果Q-Former将领域特定特征投影到共享因果表示空间；2) 多视图RQ-VAE通过共享和源特定码本将因果嵌入离散化为紧凑标记。

Result: 实验显示U^2QT在多种下游任务中表现优异，优于任务特定基线，同时在存储和计算效率上取得提升。

Conclusion: U^2QT的统一标记化框架支持与语言模型的无缝集成，适用于工业级应用。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia上分别达到91%和84%的准确率，引入新类别后性能稳定。

Conclusion: 基于提示的语义推理在有限监督下能有效实现细粒度分类。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Method: 引入基于谱分解、POD和预训练自编码器的替代解码器结构，结合迁移学习和微调策略。

Result: 改进后的PGNNIV框架成功识别了本构状态方程，提高了预测精度、噪声鲁棒性，并减少了计算需求。

Conclusion: 所提技术可根据不同需求定制，有效解决了PGNNIV框架的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识更新慢和非结构化问题，显著提升了LLMs的金融分析能力。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

Motivation: 探索如何通过少量数据和对抗训练实现个性化的音频效果生成。

Result: 学习到的卷积核具有对角结构，能产生频率依赖的时间偏移，实现音乐效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可从少量数据中发现音频变换，为效果设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI
inference tasks.

TL;DR: MORPHEUS是一个基于Transformer的多模态预训练框架，整合了组织病理学和多组学数据，通过掩码建模学习跨模态关系，并在多种任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学数据不足以全面表征分子特征和临床结果，需要结合多组学数据。

Method: MORPHEUS采用掩码建模目标，随机选择组学部分进行训练，学习跨模态关系。

Result: 在多种模态组合和任务中，MORPHEUS表现优于现有方法，并能实现任意组学生成。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是一个有前景的多模态基础模型框架，适用于肿瘤学研究。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）推理系统的调度框架，通过动态资源分配和优化策略，显著提升了吞吐量和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM工具的广泛应用，其独特的计算结构（预填充和解码阶段）需要新的路由和调度策略以提高效率。

Method: 提出了资源感知动态（RAD）调度器和SLO感知LLM推理（SLAI）调度器，分别优化吞吐量和满足服务级别目标（如TBT和TTFT）。

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上的实验表明，SLAI将中位TTFT降低53%，服务容量提升26%，同时满足尾部TBT延迟约束。

Conclusion: SLAI通过动态调度和优先级管理，显著提升了LLM推理系统的性能和服务质量。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在欧几里得空间中嵌入层次结构数据效果不佳，需要一种更适合严格层次结构（如分类、词义、文件系统）的表示方法。

Method: 提出v-PuNNs架构，神经元为p-adic球的特征函数，采用TURL原则使权重为p-adic数，并开发VAPO优化方法（包括HiPaN-DS和Adam-VAPO）。

Result: 在WordNet、GO和NCBI Mammalia等基准测试中取得最高准确率，学习到的度量具有完美超度量性质。

Conclusion: v-PuNNs将数论与深度学习结合，为层次数据提供精确、可解释且高效的模型。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Conclusion: MA-PROPS通过减少联合采样误差，显著提升了多智能体策略梯度学习的性能。

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Method: 提出FGBench数据集，包含625K分子属性推理问题，精确标注功能组信息，涵盖回归和分类任务。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs在功能组级推理上表现不佳，需提升推理能力。

Conclusion: FGBench为构建功能组级数据集提供了框架，有助于LLMs理解分子结构与属性的细粒度关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

Babai's well-known nearest-plane algorithm. We furthermore provide geometric
intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

Motivation: 动态系统学习在许多领域中至关重要，但由于缺失变量和噪声数据，传统数学模型难以处理这些不适定问题。

Method: 采用流匹配变体进行概率预测，并通过生成式机器学习方法扰动高维动态系统的状态。

Result: 在多个挑战性动态系统（包括高维WeatherBench数据集）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动态系统的概率预测提供了数学基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Conclusion: BUS是首个结合用户属性和行为的大规模树状推荐框架，兼具语义解释性和实际效果。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Conclusion: Transformer-based PRNGs能有效生成高质量伪随机数，具有理论和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Conclusion: DisTaC为模型合并提供了一种有效的预处理方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习的主要挑战在于平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能获取，现有方法通常孤立处理这两方面，忽略了它们的内在关联。

Method: T2S通过参数标记化将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转化为输入与可学习标记的交叉注意力，并通过语言引导的技能扩展实现高效知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，T2S在防止灾难性遗忘（平均NBT为1.0%）、新技能扩展（仅需8.0%可训练标记）和任务间知识迁移（平均FWT为77.7%）方面表现出色。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了一个有效的解决方案，兼具防止遗忘和高效扩展新技能的能力。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RSPO的新方法，直接优化风险寻求指标Pass@k和Max@k，解决了传统风险中性目标与评估指标不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的后训练优化采用风险中性目标，而评估却依赖风险寻求指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RSPO方法，通过利用闭式概率解决低奖励响应被无意强化的问题，并生成高效、无偏的梯度估计器。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证，RSPO有效优化了风险寻求指标。

Conclusion: RSPO成功解决了风险偏好不匹配的问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

*Shiko Kudo*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于正弦波的周期性激活函数PLU，通过其设计和Repulsive Reparameterization技术，显著提升了神经网络的表达能力和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络依赖单调递增的激活函数（如ReLU），需要大规模参数化模型来逼近复杂函数。PLU旨在通过周期性非单调性提升表达能力和效率。

Method: 引入Periodic Linear Unit (PLU)激活函数，结合Repulsive Reparameterization技术，防止激活函数退化为线性形式。

Result: 实验表明，仅需两个PLU神经元的极小MLP即可解决螺旋分类任务，这是传统激活函数无法实现的。

Conclusion: PLU提出了一种从分段泰勒近似到傅里叶式函数合成的范式转变，显著提升了参数效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图中的节点特征缺失（如敏感信息缺失）会导致GNN在节点分类等任务中表现不佳，现有方法在特征稀少时效果较差。

Method: GOODIE通过标签传播和特征传播分支获取嵌入，设计GNN解码器对齐嵌入，并引入结构-特征注意力机制和伪标签对比学习。

Result: 实验表明GOODIE在特征稀少或丰富时均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE有效结合结构和特征信息，提升了节点分类性能。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Conclusion: 为跨科学领域的通用和数据高效算子学习提供新基础。

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了时空数据的可视化可靠性和不确定性传达效果。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD)的新方法，用于解决联邦无监督学习（FUL）中全局均匀性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦无监督学习方法在局部均匀性上表现良好，但由于数据分布的非独立同质性和去中心化特性，全局均匀性不足。

Method: SSD通过鼓励客户端表征向不同方向扩展，减少聚合时的干扰，并通过投影蒸馏模块优化损失与表征质量之间的差异。

Result: 在跨设备和跨场景的联邦设置中，SSD显著提升了表征质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD证明了全局均匀性在FUL中的重要性，并提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索不足的问题，传统方法依赖显式激励，但本研究假设贪婪目标训练下代理也能自发探索。

Method: 通过实验验证三个条件（环境结构重复性、代理记忆能力、长时程信用分配）对探索行为的影响。

Result: 在满足环境结构和代理记忆条件下，贪婪目标训练的代理表现出探索行为；长时程信用分配并非总是必需。

Conclusion: 探索行为可以在特定条件下从统一的奖励最大化过程中自然产生，无需正交目标。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Conclusion: FedCD通过参数解耦和公平感知聚合，有效解决了隐私保护和诊断公平性问题。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Conclusion: GraphVSSM不仅提升了区域灾害韧性评估，还为全球灾害风险减少提供了新工具，同时推动了弱监督下的深度学习应用。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Result: PINN模型能够从稀疏数据中学习物理规律，并在复杂湍流中准确重建流场。

Conclusion: PINNs在稀疏数据下的流场重建中表现出潜力，尤其在复杂湍流场景中具有应用价值。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

Motivation: 传统交叉验证方法（如KFCV）在计算和数据混洗方面存在不足，而SRS可能导致数据不平衡。研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 研究提出了FSV方法，结合SRS和KFCV，并引入加权因子。实验使用了三个不同规模的数据集，并评估了多个性能指标。

Result: FSV在ME、VE、MSE、偏差等指标上均优于SRS和KFCV，表现出更高的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: FSV为资源受限环境和大型数据集提供了高效的数据分区解决方案，适用于机器学习实践。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，由于状态和动作分布的变化，训练深度策略可能导致次优性能甚至崩溃。因此，即使探索算法或奖励目标有所改进，优化困难可能阻碍其效果。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，通过实验评估不同环境和RL算法的优化限制。

Result: 实验表明，生成的最佳经验与策略学习性能之间存在2-3倍的差距，表明深度RL方法仅利用了生成经验的一半。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习算法在优化上存在显著限制，未来研究需关注如何更有效地利用生成的经验。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Conclusion: 本文为LoRA-based FL的聚合策略提供了理论支持，并证明了SP和PS方法的有效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

*Rémi Bardenet,Mylène Maïda,Martin Rouault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Gibbs测度的随机数值积分算法，通过调整相互作用核和约束势使平衡测度与目标分布一致，并证明了随机近似势能仍能保持快速大偏差性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用Gibbs测度（如库仑气体）建模相互作用粒子系统，并探索其在数值积分中的应用，以减小积分误差。

Method: 通过调整Gibbs测度的相互作用核和约束势，使其平衡测度与目标分布一致，并采用随机近似势能的方法。

Result: 证明了随机近似势能仍能保持快速大偏差性质，从而保证积分算法优于独立或马尔可夫求积法。

Conclusion: 该方法为数值积分提供了一种高效且理论保障的途径，尤其适用于非奇异相互作用核和库仑相互作用核。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

*Stefan Bielmeier,Gerald Friedland*

TL;DR: 研究了特征相关性对Dense Associative Memory（DAM）容量的影响，发现输入空间中的模式分离对容量有指数级影响，而特征相关性仅轻微降低容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前容量分析未考虑特征相关性对DAM的影响，而实际机器学习场景中数据通常具有相关性。

Method: 通过信息论中的汉明距离构建不同特征相关性和模式分离的数据集，使用二分搜索算法计算存储容量。

Result: 内存容量随输入空间分离度指数增长，特征相关性仅轻微降低容量，且在高阶能量函数中影响更显著。

Conclusion: DAM在高阶特征交互中表现受限，研究为理论和实践架桥，可能启发更数据驱动的方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列在不同领域中统计特性变化的问题，同时确保预测的准确性、可解释性和物理可信性。

Method: 通过自监督的领域无关概念和基于第一性原理的可微残差约束，结合Transformer的注意力机制，实现透明且科学的预测。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上测试，CPformer在8/12的MSE/MAE指标上表现最佳，相比FEDformer在部分数据集上误差显著降低。

Conclusion: CPformer通过结合概念和物理约束，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Motivation: 加密货币市场快速增长，但价格预测存在挑战，现有模型常忽略市场流动性这一关键因素。

Method: 开发四种机器学习模型（线性回归、随机森林、XGBoost、LSTM），对比是否包含流动性代理指标（VVR和VWAP）的性能。

Result: LSTM模型在包含流动性指标后表现最优，验证了流动性对预测的重要性。

Conclusion: 流动性指标对加密货币价格预测至关重要，为交易者和开发者提供了更准确的策略依据。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Result: 实验表明UniExtreme在极端和常规天气预测中均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: UniExtreme展示了在多样化极端场景中的优越适应性和预测能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不平衡回归中目标分布偏斜，导致模型忽视少数样本，现有方法依赖固定阈值，无法准确识别稀疏区域。

Result: 在32个基准数据集上表现优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法能更准确地识别和增强少数样本，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Result: 在相同时间限制下，CASP系统能解决26%到86%更多的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法使AI驱动的CASP系统更接近满足高通量筛选的低延迟需求，提升用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 历史标记方法有效解决了Transformer的局限性，提升了其在序列分类任务中的表现。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet具有出色的泛化能力，适合实际分类任务，未来将探索更多混沌映射以提升性能。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Result: 发现冷却形状的偏差-方差权衡显著影响性能，且较高的β2值在冷却阶段能带来一致改进。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段配置对提升Transformer训练性能至关重要，应与传统超参数调优并重。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

Result: InstructTime在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，支持可控编辑强度并泛化到未见指令。

Conclusion: InstructTime是一种高质量、灵活且可控的时间序列编辑方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法虽能减少模型参数，但忽略了推理时的激活内存开销，限制了实际部署的可行性。

Method: FlashSVD通过融合低秩投影核到自注意力和前馈网络管道中，动态加载和计算小块的截断因子，避免生成全尺寸激活缓冲区。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD将峰值激活内存减少70.2%，中间临时内存减少75%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩大语言模型在内存受限环境中的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

Motivation: 现实时间序列具有强周期性，但现有深度学习模型因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知先验而难以捕捉这些模式。

Result: 在真实和合成数据上均表现优异，尤其在长期预测中，且能准确恢复真实频率。

Conclusion: 频谱先验的引入提升了深度时间模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管划桨运动受欢迎，但机器学习的应用有限，且传统教练和设备成本高。

Method: 使用Apple Watch和智能手机收集动作数据，训练多种ML模型，开发基于网页的反馈界面。

Result: 极端随机树模型表现最佳（F分数0.9496），传感器靠近手腕提高了数据质量。

Conclusion: 研究表明消费设备和ML可用于划桨技术改进，但样本量有限。

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

TL;DR: SimDeep是一种新型联邦学习框架，通过相似性聚合策略解决室内定位中的非独立同分布数据和设备异构性问题，实验显示其准确率达92.89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内定位在复杂环境中支持多种基于位置的服务，但非独立同分布数据和设备异构性使其实际部署面临挑战。

Method: 提出SimDeep框架，采用相似性聚合策略，基于数据相似性聚合客户端模型更新。

Result: 实验表明SimDeep准确率达92.89%，优于传统联邦和集中式方法。

Conclusion: SimDeep在解决室内定位挑战方面表现出色，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 研究刚性系统中参数梯度消失的根本原因，以解决训练和参数识别中的优化困难。

Method: 通过分析刚性数值积分方案的稳定性函数及其导数，推导参数敏感性的衰减规律，并提供常见方案的显式公式。

Result: 证明了稳定性函数导数的衰减速率最慢为$O(|z|^{-1})$，表明所有A稳定方法在刚性区域都会抑制梯度。

Conclusion: 刚性系统中的梯度消失是数值积分方案的固有特性，对训练和参数识别构成显著障碍。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

TL;DR: 原型神经网络通过比较输入与训练数据中的代表性模式提供可解释预测。研究发现，这些原型能捕捉与临床表型相关的结构，并在外部数据集中表现出更强的临床关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究原型神经网络是否能在分类任务之外捕捉与临床表型相关的生理信号结构。

Method: 使用基于原型的深度学习模型对PTB-XL数据集进行多标签ECG分类训练，并在MIMIC-IV临床数据库中验证原型与临床诊断的关联性。

Result: 原型比分类器预测、NLP提取概念或更广泛的原型类别表现出更强的临床关联性，且能区分诊断类别内的临床变异。AUC范围从0.89（房颤）到0.91（心衰）。

Conclusion: 原型模型支持从生理时间序列数据中提取可解释的临床表型，提供超越原始训练目标的临床相关生理特征。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无监督图神经网络的概率方法，用于解决带负权环的ESPP问题，通过联合学习节点值估计和边选择概率，实现近优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESPP问题在存在负权环时为NP难问题，传统方法难以高效解决，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 使用无监督图神经网络联合学习节点值估计和边选择概率，通过替代损失函数减少负权环并嵌入算法对齐。

Result: 在100节点以内的图上，该方法优于无监督基线和经典启发式算法，并展现出对未见图的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为ESPP问题提供了一种高效的概率解决方案，具有优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Motivation: 现有基于多层感知机（MLP）的方法忽视了时间序列建模中的层次局部性和序列归纳偏差，性能提升有限。

Method: 提出了KANMixer架构，利用KAN的自适应基函数能力，构建多尺度混合主干。

Result: KANMixer在7个基准数据集的28个实验中，16次达到最优性能。

Conclusion: KAN的自适应灵活性显著改变了网络结构先验对预测性能的影响，并提供了有效利用KAN的实用指南。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

Result: 实验表明DC-PFL显著减少训练时间并提高模型准确性。

Conclusion: DC-PFL有效解决了数据异构性问题，优化了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations
of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research
directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Motivation: 先前工作中，去噪分数匹配损失的启发式加权函数缺乏理论依据，本文旨在填补这一空白，并探索更优的加权策略。

Conclusion: 本文为去噪分数匹配提供了理论支持，并展示了启发式加权的实用优势，为扩散模型的训练提供了更稳定的方法。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Conclusion: CAMEL通过动态专家管理和协作机制，显著提升了多数据流学习的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Conclusion: ARL框架结合机器效率与人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用提供了一种可扩展的模型性能提升方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模高质量EHR数据的稀缺是生物医学研究的瓶颈，现有方法难以处理多模态EHR数据的复杂性和不完整性，尤其在传统中医（TCM）领域。

Method: 提出TCDiff框架，包含三个扩散网络（参考模态扩散、跨模态桥接、目标模态扩散），分阶段生成EHR数据。

Result: TCDiff在数据保真度上平均优于现有方法10%，同时保持隐私性，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TCDiff为真实医疗场景中的EHR数据生成提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在TCM领域具有潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

TL;DR: EAC-MoE通过量化和剪枝技术解决MoE-LLMs中的GPU内存消耗和推理速度问题，提出QESC和PESF模块，显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)在扩展LLMs时面临GPU内存消耗大和低激活参数无法等效加速推理的挑战。

Method: 提出EAC-MoE框架，包含QESC（量化校准）和PESF（剪枝）模块，分别解决量化偏差和专家冗余问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: EAC-MoE为MoE-LLMs提供了一种高效的内存和推理优化方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出USRFNet，一种深度学习网络，用于解决微服务架构中性能监控和资源管理的挑战，通过分离和建模流量侧和资源侧特征，显著提高了P95尾延迟预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性带来了性能监控和资源管理的挑战，传统方法依赖的请求延迟指标对噪声敏感且无法全面反映复杂并发工作负载的行为。

Method: 提出USRFNet，使用GNN捕捉服务交互和请求传播模式，同时用gMLP模块独立建模集群资源动态，最后融合为统一系统嵌入以预测P95延迟。

Result: 在真实微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试条件下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和融合流量侧与资源侧特征，有效解决了微服务架构中的性能监控问题，为资源管理提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私敏感领域（如医疗和个性化服务）中，生成式机器学习模型的安全推理需求日益增长，但现有方法存在通信和计算开销高、隐私风险或效率低的问题。

Method: 采用细粒度分层量化方案，设计多输入查找表协议处理非线性函数，并使用双秘密共享方案和查找表进行精度转换。

Result: 在BERT-base模型上，相比现有方法实现了8倍至22倍的加速。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了安全推理的开销，同时保持了隐私保护能力。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性导致的泛化性能差问题，尤其是在客户端模型架构异构的场景下。

Method: 客户端与服务器交换特征分布（均值和协方差），训练变分转置卷积网络生成合成数据，用于微调本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在泛化准确性、通信成本和内存消耗方面优于现有异构联邦学习框架。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了异构模型架构下的联邦学习性能，同时降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

Result: 实验表明，该方法在异步、异构和非凸场景下提高了性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际应用中的联邦学习提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

Motivation: 扩展核化赌博机（KBs）和广义线性赌博机（GLBs）的模型，研究在更广泛设置下的遗憾最小化问题。

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，并设计了一种新的自归一化Bernstein-like不等式用于分析。

Result: 遗憾界为$\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$，与KBs和GLBs的最先进结果一致。

Conclusion: GKB-UCB算法在广义核化赌博机中实现了与现有方法相当的遗憾界，统一了KBs和GLBs的视角。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在编码表格数据时无法统一处理数值和分类特征或保留表格结构的问题。

Result: 高效处理3100万网络流数据，压缩比达6.18:1，生成10亿标记的语料库。

Conclusion: 为结构化数据训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的方法。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

TL;DR: PHAR是一个将时间序列分类模型的特征归因转化为结构化、可读规则的框架，提升模型透明度和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类模型的解释性差，难以理解原始数据和输入空间的高维度。

Method: PHAR将后验解释器（如LIME、SHAP）的数值特征归因转化为规则，通过规则融合步骤优化覆盖、置信度和简洁性。

Result: PHAR在解释性、决策透明度和实用性上优于传统方法，适用于长时间序列。

Conclusion: PHAR通过规则融合和可视化技术，解决了时间序列分类中的解释冲突，提升了模型的可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as

limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of

Conclusion: PINN-PI框架在随机最优控制问题中表现出色，继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，OccamVTS在多个基准数据集上实现最优性能，参数仅需1%。

Conclusion: OccamVTS通过精简参数提升预测准确性，尤其在少样本和零样本场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: AGFT显著提升LLM推理集群能效与经济性，不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出SemGuide方法，通过评分网络和重要性重加权提升扩散模型在时间序列预测中的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中表现优异，但在复杂或多模态条件下，生成的轨迹与条件协变量之间常存在语义不对齐问题。

Method: 提出SemGuide，一种即插即用的推理时间方法，通过评分网络评估扩散状态与未来协变量的语义对齐，并利用重要性重加权逐步调整采样路径。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测准确性和协变量对齐方面均有提升，尤其在复杂条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: SemGuide是一种模型无关的方法，适用于任何条件扩散框架，显著提升了语义对齐和预测性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Motivation: 传统优化方法（如ADAM）依赖手动定义的梯度估计，限制了优化性能。研究旨在通过可训练优化策略提升效率和效果。

Method: 提出伪线性TO框架，通过线性近似全梯度，匹配SGD收敛速度并减少方差；同时设计两种简化变体以降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，TO方法在强凸和非凸场景及LLM微调中均比基准算法（如ADAM）收敛更快。

Conclusion: 可训练优化器框架在性能和效率上优于传统方法，为优化领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动优化方法在训练效率和泛化能力上存在不足，尤其是面对大规模问题时。

Method: 采用ResNet视觉编码和Transformer序列建模，结合非对称组偏好优化策略，加速收敛。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP基准测试中表现优异，无需重新训练即可泛化至1000节点规模。

Conclusion: VAGPO在学习和扩展性方面均表现出色，为路由问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了异步去中心化联邦学习（DFL）中客户端持续退出的问题，提出了基于客户端重建的自适应策略，以恢复因退出导致的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步和去中心化使得联邦学习中对模型更新的信息模糊，客户端退出后难以恢复，现有方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于客户端重建的自适应策略，结合局部正则化的异步DFL框架，并在不同数据分布场景下进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，自适应策略能有效恢复部分性能损失，提升联邦学习的鲁棒性，即使无法精确重建缺失客户端数据。

Conclusion: 论文提出的策略在异步DFL中具有实用性，但仍存在局限性，未来需进一步研究客户端退出问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: TD2C在未见过的动态和真实基准测试中表现出色，尤其在非线性和高维场景中。

Conclusion: TD2C为复杂系统中的因果发现提供了鲁棒且可扩展的新工具。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

Motivation: 传统拉格朗日方法在约束优化中存在振荡和超调问题，需要一种更稳定的预惩罚机制。

Result: 理论分析表明PCPO具有收敛性，实验证明其稳定性优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PCPO为约束下的策略优化提供了稳健解决方案，对未来研究和应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Method: 提出“干预检测器”（ID）框架，通过隐藏状态和表示分析揭示线性可控性在训练中的演变，并引入ID相关指标（如热图、熵趋势、余弦相似度）进行解释。

Result: 概念在隐藏空间中逐渐线性可分，与线性可控性的出现强相关。ID框架适用于不同模型家族，验证了可控性动态的普适性。

Conclusion: 线性可控性在训练中期出现，ID框架为理解可控性动态提供了有效工具，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据出现时需要从头开始，效率低下。持续预训练是一种更高效的方法，但面临数据分布偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 研究了经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，并在Llama架构上进行了大规模实验，使用了1000亿个标记的多语言数据。

Result: 两种方法均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，梯度对齐首次在LLM预训练中验证有效，并提出了一种高效的MER实现。

Conclusion: 小比例的经验回放比增加模型规模更高效，但模型规模的扩展比高比例回放更节省计算资源。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Result: 定性分析显示子空间具有可解释性，定量实验证明子空间与GPT-2中的已知电路变量有强关联。

Conclusion: NDM方法为理解模型内部表示和构建电路提供了新视角，并展示了在大型模型中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，为GNN解释提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Result: DB-RPNI算法速度比现有方法快三个数量级，并能推断最小正确自动机。

Conclusion: DBMM和DB-RPNI算法有效解决了部分可观测环境中的非马尔可夫性问题，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRINN是一种新的近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）算法范式，通过强化学习优化执行速度，同时保持准确性。在多个基准数据集上表现优异，验证了强化学习与LLM结合的自动化优化潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）算法在AI应用中日益重要，尤其是在检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的LLM应用中。传统方法需要大量专业知识和手动优化，CRINN旨在通过强化学习自动化这一过程。

Method: CRINN将ANNS优化问题建模为强化学习任务，以执行速度作为奖励信号，自动生成更快且满足准确性约束的ANNS实现。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的NNS基准数据集上，CRINN在三个数据集上表现最佳（GIST-960-Euclidean、MNIST-784-Euclidean和GloVe-25-angular），在两个数据集上与最优算法并列第一（SIFT-128-Euclidean和GloVe-25-angular）。

Conclusion: CRINN的成功不仅证明了其在ANNS优化中的有效性，还展示了强化学习与LLM结合在自动化复杂算法优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于潜在变量模型的方法，用于动态选择特征测量，解决了现有方法的训练困难和短视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如强化学习训练困难，或基于条件互信息的贪婪方法短视，需改进。

Method: 引入监督训练的潜在变量模型，通过随机潜在空间推理未观测特征。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上广泛评估，表现优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了特征动态选择的挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

TL;DR: Kron-LoRA是一种参数高效且表达能力强的适配器，通过Kronecker积和低秩分解减少参数，同时保持性能，适用于多任务大语言模型调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型在多任务调优中参数效率和表达能力的需求。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器：首先通过Kronecker积分解线性更新，然后通过低秩分解压缩参数。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上，Kron-LoRA以更少参数匹配或超越标准LoRA性能，并支持量化。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA结合Kronecker结构、低秩压缩和量化友好性，为多任务调优提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过PRMs提升推理质量，但计算开销大，尤其是在并行生成大量解决方案时。

Method: 提出PRMs可作为部分奖励模型，利用中间步骤的评分预测最终输出质量，实现早期筛选。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证了部分奖励与最终奖励的强相关性，数学推理任务中推理FLOPs减少1.4-9倍。

Conclusion: 早期筛选是提升LLM推理计算效率的有效机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 利用电子健康记录（EHRs）中的多模态数据（结构化数据和非结构化临床笔记）进行准确的临床结果预测，以支持早期干预和优化资源分配。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1）通过微调的大型语言模型（LLM）从临床笔记中提取关键信息，并结合外部医学知识库（如PubMed）进行知识检索；2）将非结构化表示与结构化数据特征结合生成最终预测。

Result: 在30天再入院和院内死亡率预测任务中，AUC分别达到0.84和0.92，优于现有基线方法和临床实践。

Conclusion: 该框架首次结合LLM与结构化数据，通过图引导的知识检索方法显著提升了临床预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: LeanK是一种基于学习的方法，通过修剪不重要的键（K）缓存通道来优化大型语言模型（LLM）的效率，减少GPU内存并加速解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文任务时，由于键值（KV）缓存的增长，面临效率挑战。

Method: LeanK利用静态通道稀疏性，通过两阶段训练过程学习通道级静态掩码，满足特定稀疏率和硬件对齐要求。

Result: 实验表明，LeanK可减少70%的K缓存和16%-18%的V缓存内存，同时注意力计算速度提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: LeanK在不牺牲准确性的情况下，显著提升了LLM的效率，并为长上下文推理提供了对模型通道和注意力头的新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KAFNet是一种针对不规则多元时间序列（IMTS）的紧凑架构，通过改进经典预对齐（CPA）方法，结合预卷积、时间核聚合和频率线性注意力模块，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS建模因采样不均和变量异步性而具有挑战性，现有方法如CPA存在计算开销大的问题，而图模型又难以捕捉全局相关性。

Method: 提出KAFNet，包含预卷积模块、时间核聚合模块和频率线性注意力模块，优化CPA处理并降低计算成本。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上，KAFNet实现了最先进的预测性能，参数减少7.2倍，训练推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet通过改进CPA方法，证明了其在IMTS建模中的高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Result: 在单细胞扰动预测任务中，CellForge在六个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CellForge展示了多代理协作在解决复杂建模问题中的优势。

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Method: DLDA在预对齐的协作嵌入空间中，通过条件潜在扩散过程迭代生成虚假用户配置文件，并引入分散正则化机制以提高行为模式的真实性和多样性。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和五种流行推荐系统模型上的实验表明，DLDA比现有攻击方法更能提升目标物品排名且更难被检测。

Conclusion: 现代推荐系统比以往认为的更脆弱，亟需更鲁棒的防御措施。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Result: CAPO在多个数学基准测试和跨领域测试中优于监督学习和RL微调方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度信用分配和高效奖励生成，显著提升了强化学习模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的剪枝和补偿策略有效构建了高效且高性能的ST模型。

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Conclusion: GRAD通过生成模型和专家混合技术，有效解决了自动竞价中的关键挑战，为现代广告系统的多样化需求提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery

Conclusion: 结合LLM和RL的混合系统能够有效提升算法交易的性能，克服传统RL的局限性。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶测试中，背景车辆（BVs）的驾驶行为模型对生成安全关键场景至关重要。本文旨在通过双模态驾驶员模型（Dual-DM）高效生成复杂多样的安全关键场景。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练双模态驾驶员模型（Dual-DM），包含非对抗和对抗驾驶模态，并通过演化场景生成方法生成复杂多样的安全关键场景。

Result: Dual-DM在保真度（>85%真实场景相似度）和复杂度（0.45，优于基线）不降低的情况下，生成效率显著提高（0.86，优于基线195%），且生成的场景多样性高。

Conclusion: Dual-DM通过演化场景生成方法显著提升了安全关键场景的生成性能，适用于自动驾驶测试。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类专家意见不一致的领域中，评估LLM输出的可靠性具有挑战性。

Method: 分析5,680个编码决策，结合模型自我置信度和多样性指标（归一化香农熵）。

Result: 置信度-多样性双信号解释一致性达97.9%，自动接受35%片段，减少人工工作量65%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可推广的证据标准，用于校准定性研究中的AI判断。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私问题和获取源数据的困难，需要一种无需源数据的迁移学习方法。现有方法通常依赖源数据，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出了一个模型回收框架，识别相关源模型的子集以在黑白盒设置中重用。

Result: 框架使模型即服务（MaaS）提供商能够构建高效预训练模型库，支持多源无数据监督迁移学习。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了源数据不可用时的迁移学习挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph
structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph
influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces
challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Result: 在真实数据集上，Epi²-Net表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Epi²-Net为未来流行病防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Motivation: 探索Transformer中注意力汇现象的成因，揭示其背后的几何原理，以深化对注意力机制的理解并为架构设计提供指导。

Method: 通过分析多种Transformer架构，识别出三种参考框架类型（集中式、分布式和双向式），并研究其在训练早期的形成过程及与AS现象的关联。

Result: 发现AS现象是建立高维空间稳定参考框架的几何表现，架构组件（如位置编码）会影响参考框架的具体类型。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer注意力机制提供了新的理解视角，对架构设计和AS现象的关联具有重要启示。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

Motivation: 探索SNN在空间建模中的潜力，填补其在多变量时间序列预测中的空白。

Result: 模型在所有数据集上超越iSpikformer，并在长时序预测中优于传统时序模型。

Conclusion: 该架构为高效时空建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 现有PEFT策略未能利用MoE的动态路由机制，因此研究是否应在适配模块中引入路由机制以匹配MoE的多专家架构。

Method: 分析了PEFT应用于MoE语言模型时核心组件的动态行为，并研究了不同路由策略对适配效果的影响。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和Mixtral-8x7B上的实验验证了路由方法的性能与效率，并确定了不同场景下的最优配置。

Conclusion: 研究为PEFT和MoE的应用提供了实用见解，促进了更好的适配策略设计。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL) 是一种改进的 LoRA 框架，通过引入任务损失、Fisher 信息矩阵正则化和碰撞感知正则化，有效减少大语言模型微调时的对齐漂移，提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 微调大语言模型时，即使微小更新也可能导致对齐漂移，削弱安全性和行为约束。

Method: AGL 结合了任务损失、Fisher 信息矩阵正则化、任务特定正则化和碰撞感知正则化（Riemannian 重叠和测地分离）。

Result: AGL 在安全关键基准测试中将对齐漂移减少高达 50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL 是一种结构化的 LoRA 改进方法，能在微调中保持对齐性，同时开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Conclusion: 几何视角为模型解释和优化提供了新工具，有助于理解学习动态。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Result: 通过推导与总奖励方差和测量分辨率相关的遗憾界限，证明了算法的性能保证，且遗憾与具体测量策略无关。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Result: LSTM方法降低冲突风险（TET和TIT值更低），支持卡车动态合并而非完全停止。

Conclusion: LSTM方法有效提升大型卡车在工作区的合并安全性，优于传统策略。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Conclusion: PTBCC通过原型学习提供了一种更可靠、灵活的标注者专业知识建模方法，显著提升了分类性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Conclusion: 架构设计不仅是性能调优，更是塑造可扩展和可信赖神经网络学习动态的关键因素。

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Result: 在多种模型和稀疏比下，有效加速55%以上的线性计算，且在下游任务中保持高性能。

Conclusion: Amber Pruner为激活稀疏开辟了新方向，为下一代AI系统的算法与架构设计提供了基础见解。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Conclusion: 需整合农场管理策略和气候适应措施，未来研究将采用集成方法以提高检测和应对策略的准确性。

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

*Qi Xiong,Hai Dong,Nasrin Sohrabi,Zahir Tari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedLAD的新型防御方法，通过线性代数优化检测联邦学习中的Sybil攻击，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习构成重大威胁，恶意节点可能主导系统，因此需要开发有效的防御措施。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性问题，转化为线性代数优化挑战，提取独立线性组合以过滤恶意元素。

Result: 实验表明，FedLAD在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时保持低攻击成功率，且在0.2至0.5时保持高模型准确性。

Conclusion: FedLAD能有效提升联邦学习系统在数据投毒攻击下的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Motivation: 96%以上的人类蛋白质尚未被药物开发，现有虚拟筛选方法缺乏原子级精度和结合适应性预测能力，限制了其转化应用。

Method: AuroBind结合直接偏好优化、自蒸馏高置信复合物和师生加速策略，联合预测配体结合结构和结合适应性。

Result: AuroBind在结构和功能基准测试中优于现有方法，筛选速度提升10万倍，实验命中率达7-69%，并成功识别孤儿GPCRs的激动剂和拮抗剂。

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构-功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与药物发现之间的空白。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于鲁棒知识蒸馏的语义通信框架（RKD-SC），通过轻量级架构搜索和两阶段知识蒸馏，解决了大规模模型部署中的计算复杂性和噪声鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型（LSMs）虽然能有效支持语义通信系统，但其高计算复杂性和资源需求限制了直接部署。

Method: 结合知识蒸馏和轻量级架构搜索（KDL-DARTS）确定高效语义编码器，并通过两阶段鲁棒知识蒸馏（RKD）和通道感知变换器（CAT）提升系统鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，RKD-SC显著减少了模型参数，同时保持了教师模型的高性能，并在噪声环境下表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RKD-SC为高效且鲁棒的语义通信系统提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Conclusion: ACPOMDPs和Privileged Information Guided Dreamer为安全强化学习提供了有效解决方案，展示了特权信息的优势。

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

*Wei Hao,Bin Chong,Ronghua Ji,Chen Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于MLP、MSCNN和CA的轨迹预测模型，旨在减少预测误差并保持合理的推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据包含全局和局部时间信息，且用户行为发生在不同时间尺度，增加了提取完整时间模式和行为模式的难度。

Method: 使用MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息（通过不同大小的卷积核捕捉多分辨率信息），并通过CA融合全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在12步预测中比ModernTCN降低了MSE 5.04%和MAE 4.35%，同时保持相似的推理时间。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了轨迹预测中的时间模式提取问题，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

TL;DR: 论文提出Multi-Treatment-DML框架，用于优化个人贷款平台中的信用额度、利率和贷款条件，解决连续多维处理的因果估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果方法主要针对二元/离散处理，难以应对连续多维处理，且金融领域要求处理与结果间具有单调关系。

Method: 利用双机器学习（DML）框架，解决观测数据偏差、处理多维连续变量，并强制单调约束。

Result: 在公共基准和实际工业数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并通过在线A/B测试证实了其实际优势。

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML在现实贷款操作中具有显著优势，满足了金融领域的严格要求。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Result: 在三个问答基准测试中平均提升2.8%，并在跨任务中表现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、可扩展且模型无关，为提升语言模型真实性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多个领域表现出色，但其训练数据、计算资源和能源消耗的高需求限制了实际部署。因此，研究探索了利用小型专业化模型聚合输出的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种网络化LLM系统，包括多个用户、中央任务处理器和主题专业化LLM集群。用户提交二元查询，处理器将其路由到选定的LLM集群，聚合个体响应后返回最终答案。

Result: 模拟实验表明，聚合响应的准确性始终高于单个LLM，尤其是在参与模型的独立性能相近时，改进更为显著。

Conclusion: 通过优化网络化LLM系统，可以平衡信息准确性和响应及时性，为实际部署提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Motivation: 传统多策略方法依赖在线强化学习和进化框架，导致样本效率低和交互成本高。

Method: MPFT框架分为四个阶段：近似帕累托顶点策略、设计帕累托跟踪机制、填充稀疏区域、组合策略近似帕累托前沿。

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务中，MPFT表现出更高的超体积性能，显著减少了交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架在多目标强化学习中具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分割学习（SL）在恶意客户端攻击下模型准确性下降的问题。

Method: 将客户端分为N+1个集群，独立训练每个集群，选择验证损失最低的集群进行更新，并通过Pigeon-SL+提升训练效率。

Result: 在三种代表性攻击模型下，Pigeon-SL显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络提供了一种高效且安全的分布式学习方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Result: 在五种真实图上实验，框架表现优异，提供了灵活有效的学习型最短路径搜索方案。

Conclusion: 该框架为通用图上的最短路径搜索提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner是一种高效、灵活的剪枝方法，适用于不同剪枝比例，且无需微调。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的DNN训练面临泛化问题和DDR高能耗问题，现有方法存在缺陷。

Method: 提出DE-SNE算法（DNN-free样本选择）和近内存计算技术，构建NMS系统。

Result: NMS在模型精度上优于现有方法（DQ、DQAS、NeSSA）。

Conclusion: NMS是首个能有效解决泛化问题和DDR能耗问题的DNN-free近内存采样技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于符号动力学和数据压缩的分类框架，利用混沌映射建模类别，并通过压缩表示进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新从动力学系统和压缩的角度解读分类问题，探索学习理论和信息处理的基础视角。

Method: 通过阈值化和符号化训练数据，利用混沌映射生成符号序列，计算转移概率构建类别模型；测试时通过反向迭代压缩表示预测类别。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现良好（如乳腺癌数据集F1分数0.9531）。

Conclusion: 该方法为分类问题提供了动力学系统和压缩的新视角，性能虽非最优但具有理论意义。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

TL;DR: BOOST框架通过离线评估自动选择贝叶斯优化的最佳核函数和采集函数组合，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化的性能高度依赖核函数和采集函数的选择，不当组合会导致性能下降和资源浪费，而现有方法缺乏自动选择机制。

Method: BOOST通过离线评估阶段，利用参考子集和查询子集预测不同核函数-采集函数组合的性能，选择最优配置。

Result: 实验表明，BOOST在合成基准和实际超参数优化任务中均优于固定超参数的标准方法。

Conclusion: BOOST提供了一种高效、自动化的核函数和采集函数选择方法，提升了贝叶斯优化的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

Motivation: 现有贝叶斯方法（如HMC和MFVI）在大规模数据上计算不可行或依赖限制性假设，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了基于Polya-Gamma增强的可扩展Gibbs采样和Laplace近似方法，并与MFVI和HMC进行比较。

Result: Gibbs采样和HMC能正确估计不确定性，而MFVI不能，Laplace近似仅在大样本下有效。后验均值在保留似然上优于MAP估计。

Conclusion: 后验采样对词嵌入的重要性得到验证，尤其是在小样本情况下。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INT4内核无法充分利用Blackwell架构中FP4 Tensor Cores的性能潜力，需解决数据格式不匹配问题。

Method: 提出MicroMix算法，结合MX数据格式和量化阈值，选择性分配高精度通道以平衡精度和效率。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优异，比TensorRT-FP8快20%，并提升预填充延迟和内存效率。

Conclusion: MicroMix在Blackwell架构上实现了高效且精确的LLM推理，代码已开源。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW和FGW距离计算复杂且非凸，现有切片方法局限于欧几里得几何且失去等距不变性。

Method: 基于下界、分层最优传输和合适的一维OT求积规则，提出新的切片技术。

Result: 新切片FGW显著减少计算量，保持等距不变性，适用于任意几何比较，并定义了一个伪度量。

Conclusion: 新方法在数值上更稳健可靠，适用于形状检索和图同构测试。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非均匀剪枝方法依赖手动设计策略，无法适应动态剪枝需求，且评估耗时。

Method: PPF利用轻量级性能预测器和自适应代理，实现实时剪枝决策和快速策略评估。

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Llama3-8B上，PPF动态剪枝降低困惑度33.4%，静态剪枝降低84.78%，预测误差<0.0011。

Conclusion: PPF高效且性能优越，适用于动态和静态剪枝场景。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，GEFRFE能捕捉更丰富的结构特征并显著提升分类性能，同时保持与GEFFE相当的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: GEFRFE通过分数域扩展显著提升了谱嵌入的表现力，为图表示学习提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Result: 在病理图像分类任务中验证了ASMR的检测能力，并展示了动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR是一种无需先验知识的实用防御机制，能有效提升联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了专家不确定性带来的标签噪声问题，提升了医学图像分析的准确性。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Conclusion: AnalogCoder-Pro为模拟电路设计提供了一种高效的端到端自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SplitMe框架通过交替训练近实时和非实时RIC的模型，减少通信开销，优化资源分配，显著优于传统FL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决O-RAN中联邦学习模型训练时间过长和通信成本高的问题。

Method: 提出SplitMe框架，利用互学习交替训练模型和逆模型，结合零阶技术和联合优化问题。

Result: SplitMe在成本和收敛性上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed。

Conclusion: SplitMe为O-RAN中的联邦学习提供了高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

TL;DR: JacobiNet是一种基于神经网络的坐标变换方法，用于解决PINNs在求解PDE时的不规则边界问题，显著提高了精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在处理不规则边界时存在归一化不一致、边界条件不准确和损失项不平衡等问题，传统方法受限于特定网格和简单几何形状。

Method: JacobiNet通过监督点对学习连续可微的映射，利用轻量级MLP直接计算雅可比矩阵，并与下游PINNs无缝集成。

Result: JacobiNet将相对L2误差从0.287-0.637降至0.013-0.039，精度平均提升18.3倍，在血管状域中预测精度提升3.65倍，速度提升10倍以上。

Conclusion: JacobiNet解决了PINNs的关键挑战，展示了其泛化能力、高精度和高效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文首次大规模系统比较了XAI方法在神经影像数据上的表现，发现GradCAM和Layer-wise Relevance Propagation存在明显缺陷，而SmoothGrad表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证XAI方法在神经影像数据中的可靠性，避免因方法不适用导致的错误解释。

Method: 使用包含已知信号源的预测任务构建验证框架，对约45,000张脑部MRI进行系统比较。

Result: GradCAM无法准确定位特征，Layer-wise Relevance Propagation产生大量虚假解释，而SmoothGrad表现稳定。

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据专门调整，现有研究中的解释可能需要重新评估，SmoothGrad更适合此类应用。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的系统用于动态特征选择（DFS），提高了决策的可解释性，并展示了其性能优于现有不透明方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态特征选择方法对所有样本使用相同的特征集，缺乏透明性，而DFS能根据每个样本动态调整特征选择，尤其适用于需要决策透明性的场景（如临床决策）。

Method: 采用基于规则的系统作为DFS的基础分类器，增强决策可解释性；通过约束特征搜索空间降低计算复杂度；量化每个特征查询的不确定性。

Result: 提出的方法在性能上与现有贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在保持高性能的同时显著提升了决策透明性，适用于需要可解释性的应用场景。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

TL;DR: ARGNN提出了一种自适应黎曼图神经网络框架，通过动态学习局部几何结构，解决了现有方法难以捕捉图数据复杂几何异质性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据通常表现出复杂的几何异质性，现有基于固定曲率流形的几何GNN难以适应这种多样性。

Method: ARGNN通过学习连续且各向异性的黎曼度量张量场，使每个节点能动态调整局部几何结构，并结合Ricci流正则化保证几何稳定性。

Result: 在多种基准数据集上表现优异，能够自适应捕捉多样结构，并提供可解释的几何洞察。

Conclusion: ARGNN为图数据的几何建模提供了统一且高效的解决方案，兼具理论严谨性和实际性能。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据稀缺问题，传统生成模型在低数据量下表现不佳，LLMs忽略数据依赖结构导致合成数据保真度低。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1. 显式结构发现学习DAG；2. 用DAG引导LLM生成，确保数据依赖结构。

Result: StructSynth生成的合成数据在结构完整性和下游任务效用上显著优于现有方法，尤其在低数据量场景表现优异。

Conclusion: StructSynth成功平衡隐私保护与统计保真度，为表格数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在噪声和动态不确定性下的可解释性和稳定性问题。

Method: 采用编码器-传播器-解码器结构，通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间中学习时序动态。

Result: 在合成系统、气候数据、金融时间序列和电力数据集上表现优于LSTM和Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一个灵活、可解释且鲁棒的高维动态预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Result: 实验表明，LOST在60M到7B参数的LLM预训练中性能优于或接近全秩模型，同时显著降低计算和内存开销。

Conclusion: LOST是一种高效且性能优越的LLM预训练方法。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Conclusion: 论文提出将八卦协议作为结构化协议的补充，并呼吁进一步研究其在多代理系统中的整合问题，以推动更具韧性和自组织的系统发展。

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed
toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination.
Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent
messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in
enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents
continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This
paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their
fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing
layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables
scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises
unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,
and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new
framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a
complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical
gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could
reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around
intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a
silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,
reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有任务分配研究未整合多任务、多属性智能体与异构任务分配，且算法在特定场景下误差较大。

Result: 实验表明GCBHA在任务分配时间和解质量上表现优异，预测与实际任务成本误差显著降低。

Conclusion: GCBHA有效解决了异构多任务多智能体任务分配问题，提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: In scenarios like automated warehouses, assigning tasks to robots presents a
heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation problem. However,
existing task allocation study ignores the integration of multi-task and
multi-attribute agent task allocation with heterogeneous task allocation. In
addition, current algorithms are limited by scenario constraints and can incur
significant errors in specific contexts. Therefore, this study proposes a
distributed heterogeneous multi-task and multi-agent task allocation algorithm
with a time window, called group consensus-based heterogeneous auction (GCBHA).
Firstly, this method decomposes tasks that exceed the capability of a single
Agent into subtasks that can be completed by multiple independent agents. And
then groups similar or adjacent tasks through a heuristic clustering method to
reduce the time required to reach a consensus. Subsequently, the task groups
are allocated to agents that meet the conditions through an auction process.
Furthermore, the method evaluates the task path cost distance based on the
scenario, which can calculate the task cost more accurately. The experimental
results demonstrate that GCBHA performs well in terms of task allocation time
and solution quality, with a significant reduction in the error rate between
predicted task costs and actual costs.

Result: 调解者的引入使得自利智能体采取更公平的行动，从而提高了整体回报的公平性。

Conclusion: 调解者在Stackelberg博弈中能有效提升公平性，为多智能体系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing
attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a
traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the
followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be
interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for
example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who
should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead
to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are
self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define
this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents'
returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously
been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control,
such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our
framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control
(leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to
self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall
fairness in agents' returns.

Abstract: The inevitable modality imperfection in real-world scenarios poses
significant challenges for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). While existing
methods tailor reconstruction or joint representation learning strategies to
restore missing semantics, they often overlook complex dependencies within and
across modalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available
modalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes
a novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality
interactions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from
complementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable
hypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual
information within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore
inter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing
complementary information across different modalities. Finally, the knowledge
from perfect samples is integrated to supervise our interaction processes,
guiding the model toward learning reliable and robust joint representations.
Extensive experiments on MOSI and MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DRKF的多模态情感识别方法，通过解耦表示和知识融合解决模态异质性和情感不一致性问题，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态异质性和情感线索不一致的挑战，影响性能。

Method: DRKF包含优化表示学习模块（ORL）和知识融合模块（KF），分别处理模态异质性和情感信息融合，并引入情感判别子模块（ED）处理不一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP、MELD和M3ED数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DRKF通过解耦表示和知识融合有效解决了MER中的关键挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by
integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However,
inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain
key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a
Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF
consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module
and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual
information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to
decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features
while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight
self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality
and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused
representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality
selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion
Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to
retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even
if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion
Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging
preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code

### [614] [Sparse 3D Perception for Rose Harvesting Robots: A Two-Stage Approach Bridging Simulation and Real-World Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00900)
*Taha Samavati,Mohsen Soryani,Sina Mansouri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对花卉采摘机器人的3D感知流程，通过合成数据集和深度学习优化了稀疏3D定位，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对药用植物（如大马士革玫瑰）的需求激增，但人工采摘效率低，限制了规模化生产。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：先在立体图像上进行2D点检测，再用轻量级深度神经网络估计深度；为解决真实数据稀缺问题，使用Blender生成合成数据集。

Result: 2D检测F1分数达95.6%（合成）和74.4%（真实），深度估计误差在2米范围内为3%。

Conclusion: 该流程为农业自动化提供了可扩展的精准采摘解决方案，缩小了合成与真实数据的差距。

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用独立模型处理CAVs的多个任务，导致高成本和计算负担。MTL通过统一模型联合学习多任务，提高了效率和资源利用率。

Method: 综述了MTL在CAVs中的关键功能模块（如感知、预测、规划）的应用，分析了现有方法的优缺点。

Result: MTL在CAVs中展现出潜力，但仍存在研究空白，如实时性和多任务权衡问题。

Conclusion: MTL是CAVs领域的重要方向，未来研究需解决现有方法的局限性并优化性能。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

*Jack Zeng,Andreu Matoses Gimenez,Eugene Vinitsky,Javier Alonso-Mora,Sihao Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化方法，利用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练微型飞行器（MAV）团队实现6自由度负载操控，无需全局状态或通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制器多为集中式，需全局信息且计算成本高，限制了灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用MARL训练外环控制策略，仅通过负载姿态观测隐式通信，设计了基于线性加速度和机体速率的动作空间。

Result: 实验验证了方法在负载模型不确定性和动态3D运动中的有效性，性能媲美集中式方法，且具备异构策略协作和容错能力。

Conclusion: 去中心化方法在降低计算成本的同时，实现了高灵活性和可扩展性，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法在复杂地形场景中具有显著优势，并通过对比测试验证了有效性。

Conclusion: BarlowWalk通过自监督学习减少对外部地形感知的依赖，提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), driven by data-driven methods, has become an
effective solution for robot leg motion control problems. However, the
mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as
teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times,
which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes
BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated
with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow
Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical
observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing
self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information
to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly
reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain
scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares
BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the
experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有机器人中间件难以满足多样化通信需求、优化数据传输效率及确保调度确定性。

Method: 采用多级服务发现组播和消息桥机制，支持多种通信模式（如跨芯片以太网协议和PCIe通信），并利用共享内存优化消息分发。

Conclusion: RIMAOS2C提升了机器人操作系统的通信能力，为分布式计算架构中的通信优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Robotic middleware is fundamental to ensuring reliable communication among
system components and is crucial for intelligent robotics, autonomous vehicles,
and smart manufacturing. However, existing robotic middleware often struggles
to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission
efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in
large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a
service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to
tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast,
RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple
cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core
mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs
shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy
and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson
Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the
large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two
cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves
large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback
latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the
communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel
approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for
autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Hestia为自动化数据收集提供了一种高效且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决非抓取式操作中模型不准确和数据需求大的问题，结合模型优化与学习方法的优势。

Method: 利用接触隐式轨迹优化（CITO）设计演示引导的深度强化学习（RL），并通过特权训练策略实现仿真到现实的迁移。

Result: 在多个旋转操作任务中验证了方法的有效性，成功实现了仅依靠本体感知、视觉和力传感的仿真到现实迁移。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在非抓取式操作中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为复杂接触任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring
real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics.
While iterative learning model predictive control~(LMPC) offers a promising
framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to
drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off
between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with
three key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights
time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe
set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates,
and~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints
without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame
transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories
generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a
maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85\%. Even applied to the most
aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real
drone, a 6.05\% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method
pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation
and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak
performance of drone racing.

Conclusion: 人机红队范式能有效提升机器人在安全关键任务中的安全操作和信任度。

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

Motivation: 现有方法仅基于单一特征距离检索数据，可能引入无关演示，导致性能下降。COLLAGE旨在通过多线索融合解决这一问题。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中，COLLAGE分别以5.1%和16.6%的优势超越现有方法。

Conclusion: COLLAGE是一种通用且高效的方法，能够灵活结合多线索，显著提升少样本模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

per second, along with other dynamic movements such as jumping and climbing
moderate slopes.

Result: 在自主社交导航中，该方法能灵活适应动态环境，实时满足安全需求。

Conclusion: 该框架有效融合学习和优化，提升了机器人行为规划的适应性和安全性。

Abstract: Planning safe and effective robot behavior in dynamic, human-centric
environments remains a core challenge due to the need to handle uncertainty,
adapt in real-time, and ensure safety. Optimization-based planners offer
explicit constraint handling but rely on oversimplified initialization,
reducing solution quality. Learning-based planners better capture multimodal
possible solutions but struggle to enforce constraints such as safety. In this
paper, we introduce a unified generation-refinement framework bridging learning
and optimization with a novel reward-guided conditional flow matching (CFM)
model and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control. Our key innovation is
in the incorporation of a bidirectional information exchange: samples from a
reward-guided CFM model provide informed priors for MPPI refinement, while the
optimal trajectory from MPPI warm-starts the next CFM generation. Using
autonomous social navigation as a motivating application, we demonstrate that
our approach can flexibly adapt to dynamic environments to satisfy safety
requirements in real-time.

Result: 在速度跟踪任务中，SE-Policy比现有方法跟踪精度提升40%，并实现更优的时空协调性。

Conclusion: SE-Policy有效提升了人形机器人的运动协调性和任务性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated
and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot,
leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor
control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL
framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry
invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces
consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and
spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive
experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and
real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that
SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability
to humanoid robots.

Result: 在90次飞行实验中，VLH的目标捕获成功率为56.7%（平均耗时21.3秒，姿态误差0.24米），纹理识别准确率100%。在新任务中，视觉、运动、物理和语义任务的性能分别为70.0%、54.4%、40.0%和35.0%。

Conclusion: VLH展示了触觉反馈与感知推理和意图协同进化的能力，推动了更具表现力和沉浸感的人机交互。

Abstract: We present VLH, a novel Visual-Language-Haptic Foundation Model that unifies
perception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual
reality. Unlike prior work that treats haptics as a secondary, reactive
channel, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues as a direct
consequence of contextual visual understanding and natural language commands.
Our platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar
linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an
exocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed
by a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450
multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx,
Hy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time
operation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH
achieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s,
pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization
tests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0%
(semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability
to co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing
expressive, immersive human-robot interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ERL方法在轨迹优化中的不足，实现更安全、高效的任务特定轨迹。

Method: 结合ERL和残差学习，识别需修改的轨迹段，用B样条生成平滑调整。

Result: 实验显示残差学习优于从头训练，样本效率和任务性能更优，仿真到现实的差距小。

Conclusion: MoRe-ERL是一种通用且高效的框架，适用于动态任务场景，仿真到现实迁移效果好。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Conclusion: RoboMemory为物理机器人多模态记忆系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了终身学习能力。

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a
foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical
robots.

Motivation: 模仿学习策略在环境变化（如光照变化）下泛化能力不足。

Method: 利用逆向渲染分解演示帧的几何和材质属性，结合Stable Video Diffusion进行时序光照传播。

Result: 在7自由度机器人上，行为克隆泛化差距减少40.1%，并在6种光照条件下验证。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升泛化能力，并支持三种下游应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in data augmentation, policies trained via imitation
learning still struggle to generalize across environmental variations such as
lighting changes. To address this, we propose the first framework that
leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on
real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the
first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and
material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to
render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent
augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on
robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our
framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented
sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning
generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using
720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications
enabled by the proposed framework.

TL;DR: HALO是一种新颖的离线奖励学习算法，通过量化人类导航直觉为视觉奖励函数，用于机器人导航。它在离线数据上学习奖励模型，并通过Plackett-Luce损失训练。实验表明，HALO在成功率和轨迹优化上显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 将人类导航直觉转化为机器人导航的视觉奖励函数，以提升导航性能。

Method: 利用离线数据和专家轨迹，通过Boltzmann分布和用户反馈生成偏好排名，使用Plackett-Luce损失训练奖励模型。

Result: HALO在真实环境中表现优异，成功率和轨迹优化显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HALO在学习和经典导航框架中均表现出色，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm
that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward
function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data,
leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training,
actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using
preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the
preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive
navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to
align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,
we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline
learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a
model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward
as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both
learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments
on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained
with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not
present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based
navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a
12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in
Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无参考且独立于恶劣天气条件的框架Advent，用于解决自动驾驶感知任务中的天气适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气（如雾、雨）对自动驾驶感知任务（如语义分割、目标检测）构成挑战，传统域适应方法依赖清晰图像且难以应对多种天气混合情况。

Method: Advent框架包括三个组件：局部序列机制（LSM）利用相邻帧的时间相关性；全局混洗机制（GSM）防止过拟合；展开正则器（URs）增强跨天气泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，Advent在语义分割任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Advent框架无需清晰参考图像，能适应任意天气条件，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant
challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic
segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to
minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather
conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically
relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain
in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and
performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather
conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse
weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model
architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is
achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of
clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.
Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential
Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to
achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind
arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed
to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence
to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded
Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed
regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather
generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess
the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large
margins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLASS的方法，通过对比学习和动作序列监督学习行为表示，解决了行为克隆在异构数据集上的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆在异构数据集（如不同相机视角或物体外观）中表现不佳，容易过拟合单个演示而忽略共享结构。

Method: CLASS利用动态时间规整（DTW）识别相似动作序列，通过监督对比学习和软InfoNCE损失优化行为表示。

Result: 在5个仿真基准和3个真实任务中，CLASS表现出色，特别是在视觉变化显著的下游策略学习中，成功率高达75%。

Conclusion: CLASS通过对比学习显著提升了行为克隆的泛化能力，为机器人操作任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance in
robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of
actions, and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant
challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with
different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades
despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to
overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure,
limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via
Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral
representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.
CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with
similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation
benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using
retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream
policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS
pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline
methods fail to perform competitively. Project webpage:

Motivation: 传统流匹配方法在多模态任务中表现不佳，容易产生模糊行为，因此需要一种能有效捕捉任务和轨迹多模态的方法。

Method: 提出VFP，结合变分潜在先验、K-OT分布对齐和MoE解码器，实现模式感知动作生成和高效推理。

Result: 在41个任务中，VFP相比基线方法提升49%的任务成功率，同时保持快速推理和紧凑模型。

Conclusion: VFP在多模态机器人操作任务中表现出色，为流匹配策略提供了有效改进。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

optimization approach for composite drone services. This approach identifies
the most time-efficient and energy-efficient skyway path and recharging
schedule for each drone in the network. We conduct extensive experiments using
a real-world drone flight dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework.

Conclusion: DexReMoE具有高度的可扩展性和适应性，适用于通用手内重定向任务。

Abstract: In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation,
requiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain
stable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However,
prior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to
generalize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous
Reorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are
trained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide
range of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as
privileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in
simulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel
out-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting
objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average
consecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse
set of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the
worst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05. These results
underscore the scalability and adaptability of the DexReMoE framework for
general-purpose in-hand reorientation.

Abstract: Terrain traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots,
especially in unstructured environments where visual cues and reasoning play a
key role. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for zero-shot
estimation, the problem remains inherently ill-posed. To explore this, we
introduce a small dataset of human-annotated water traversability ratings,
revealing that while estimations are subjective, human raters still show some
consensus. Additionally, we propose a simple pipeline that integrates VLMs for
zero-shot traversability estimation. Our experiments reveal mixed results,
suggesting that current foundation models are not yet suitable for practical
deployment but provide valuable insights for further research.

Conclusion: OpenMap通过结合结构语义和LLM辅助的指令接地，成功地将自由形式语言与3D感知桥接，为具身导航提供了更准确的指令接地方法。

Abstract: Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental
for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in
visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by
leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall
short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances,
due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction
interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language
map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address
semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic
Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and
vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To
improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted
Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance
selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions.
We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic
mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks. Experimental results show
that OpenMap outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in bridging free-form language

Abstract: Gestures are an expressive input modality for controlling multiple robots,
but their use is often limited by rigid mappings and recognition constraints.
To move beyond these limitations, we propose roleplaying metaphors as a
scaffold for designing richer interactions. By introducing three roles:
Director, Puppeteer, and Wizard, we demonstrate how narrative framing can guide
the creation of diverse gesture sets and interaction styles. These roles enable
a variety of scenarios, showing how roleplay can unlock new possibilities for

Motivation: 现有手动鼻气管插管方法存在交叉感染和黏膜损伤风险，而自动化研究尚未解决鼻气管插管的独特挑战。

Method: 开发了嵌入力传感器的自主系统，并提出了RACCT模型处理复杂管-组织交互和部分视觉观察。

Result: RACCT模型在所有方面优于ACT模型，平均峰值插入力减少66%，同时保持相同成功率。

Conclusion: 该系统有望降低感染风险并提高操作安全性。

Abstract: Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is critical for establishing artificial airways
in clinical anesthesia and critical care. Current manual methods face
significant challenges, including cross-infection, especially during
respiratory infection care, and insufficient control of endoluminal contact
forces, increasing the risk of mucosal injuries. While existing studies have
focused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains
unexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater
diameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing
insertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI
system with two key components to address these challenges. First, an
autonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with
force sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the
Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is
developed to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual
observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms
the ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak
insertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent
success rates. This validates the system's potential for reducing infection
risks and improving procedural safety.

Conclusion: GMCs及其数值模型为磁软连续体机器人的设计和性能优化提供了全面且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots are capable of bending with remote control in
confined space environments, and they have been applied in various
bioengineering contexts. As one type of ferromagnetic soft continuums, the
Magnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC)
exhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base
material, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding
fabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have
primarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of
a comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed
graded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending
performance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their
performance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending
experiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field,
cross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length. The graded-stiffness design
strategy applied to GMCs prevents sharp bending at the fixed end and results in
a more circular curvature. We also trained an expansion model for GMCs' bending
performance that is highly efficient and accurate compared to the simulation
process. An extensive library of bending prediction for GMCs was built using
the trained model.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has revolutionized the healthcare industry by
providing surgeons with greater precision, reducing invasiveness, and improving
patient outcomes. However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on
the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the
surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent
recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our
recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to
monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted
surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of
surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent
multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart
rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in
mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to
interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of
robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.

Conclusion: 通过利用环境特征，模块化机器人可以超越自身限制，迈向更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the
modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls,
communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the
complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile
laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the
Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and
reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In
this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better
robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular
robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,
adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from
simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features --
ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots'
capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only
adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to
do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that
transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.

TL;DR: L3M+P框架结合经典规划方法与大型语言模型（LLMs），通过动态知识图谱解决机器人长期部署中的环境建模和规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以适应长期连续部署的机器人需求，且缺乏动态环境建模能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人实验中，L3M+P在状态更新和规划生成上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: L3M+P通过动态知识图谱有效提升了机器人的长期规划能力。

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic
simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators
with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness
of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if
the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a
pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric
employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model
predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially
controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are
interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the
standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego
vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where
top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego
agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we
propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to
uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as
pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world
models under these new metrics.

Conclusion: 该设计展示了四旋翼在狭窄空间中的适应性和多功能性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor design capable of folding its arms
vertically to grasp objects and navigate through narrow spaces. The
transformation is controlled actively by a central servomotor, gears, and
racks. The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a
parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant
orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a
conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with
grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances
during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode
controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame
shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of
the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

Conclusion: RICL为VLA模型提供了简单的上下文学习接口，显著提升了其适应性和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SetItUp是一个神经符号框架，通过学习少量训练示例和结构化自然语言任务规范，预测功能对象排列（FORM）的目标姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功能对象排列（FORM）任务中的指令通常不明确，缺乏目标姿态的具体描述，因此需要一种方法来自动推断这些姿态。

Method: SetItUp采用两阶段方法：1) 使用LLM生成Python程序以预测对象间的抽象空间关系图；2) 使用扩散模型预测对象姿态。

Result: 在三个任务家族上的实验表明，SetItUp在生成功能合理、物理可行且美观的对象排列上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SetItUp通过神经符号结合的方法，有效解决了FORM任务中的目标姿态推断问题。

Abstract: Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to
fulfill a function, e.g., "set up a dining table for two". One key challenge
here is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not
explicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,
a neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects
from a few training examples and a structured natural-language task
specification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract
spatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate
representation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)
predicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the
grounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to
induce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.
This program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.
For (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture
primitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object
poses based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning
three distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing
items on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show
that SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically
feasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements. This article extends
our conference paper published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2024.

Result: 在多样化关节物体上达到最先进的识别精度，并支持零样本、文本引导的操控。

Conclusion: ScrewSplat提供了一种简单高效的解决方案，适用于实际场景中的关节物体识别与操控。

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Conclusion: 该框架在力控机器人任务中实现长期可靠性，减少人工需求。

Abstract: The automation of robotic tasks requires high precision and adaptability,
particularly in force-based operations such as insertions. Traditional
learning-based approaches either rely on static datasets, which limit their
ability to generalize, or require frequent manual intervention to maintain good
performances. As a result, ensuring long-term reliability without human
supervision remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an
adaptive self-supervised learning framework for insertion classification that
continuously improves its precision over time. The framework operates in
real-time, incrementally refining its classification decisions by integrating
newly acquired force data. Unlike conventional methods, it does not rely on
pre-collected datasets but instead evolves dynamically with each task
execution. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate how the system
progressively reduces execution time while maintaining near-perfect precision
as more samples are processed. This adaptability ensures long-term reliability
in force-based robotic tasks while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声条件下的点云配准中具有潜力，性能接近LiDAR系统。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: FedVLA在保护隐私的同时实现了高效的VLA模型训练。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Conclusion: 无需先验运动学知识，即可解决铰接物体操作中效率与可靠性的长期矛盾。

Abstract: Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate
successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both
effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and
efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.
Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods
relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering
structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust
manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through
reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces
TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated
object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous
approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals
requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources
of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to
predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments,
significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations
across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments,
our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming
the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and
trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that
the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated
object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior
kinematic knowledge.

Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to
address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems,
represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a
cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model
parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update
the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic
estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error
reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives
generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model
selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also
equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal
estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall
motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the
size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive
learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well
as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter
and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of
the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go
arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with
the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion
planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is
demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model
represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and
operating within a cluttered environment.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: 多类检测模型在物理人机协作中可行，滑动窗口预处理策略效果最佳。

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots
collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions
with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical
aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified.
Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish
between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by
evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed
contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot
manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis.
Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets.
The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing,
demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a
comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is
optimal for this task.

the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in
turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and
the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability
and the quality of experience perceived by participants interacting with the

Result: 生成的视频序列可用于训练全景视觉感知模型，提升360度场景多目标跟踪性能。

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为四足机器人提供了高质量全景数据生成方案，推动感知系统发展。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at
https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Motivation: 现实中的多机器人系统常面临传感和通信故障，但现有研究对此关注不足，需要一种能区分临时和永久故障的协调方法。

Method: 将机器人团队分组，连接机器人通过部分集中式非线性优化协作，断开机器人则通过分散式优化独立运行。

Result: 在多种故障场景下，框架表现出稳健性能，适用于未知危险区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为多机器人系统提供了一种实用且通用的故障感知解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world
deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and
permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly
degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite
its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in
the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the
complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware
coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot
target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our
approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)
probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent
sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding
inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or
communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized
behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned
into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and
collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots
experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate
independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them
to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate
our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive
assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our
framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments
with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for
the multi-robot systems community.

Conclusion: 该方法使线驱动机器人能在任意位置自主操作，突破了传统线驱动机器人对预设环境的依赖。

Abstract: In order to expand the operational range and payload capacity of robots,
wire-driven robots that leverage the external environment have been proposed.
It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own
structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach
multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an
operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to
specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot
that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a
multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and
environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an
anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by
flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable
attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in
environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple
wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can
autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the
benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.

Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the
robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact
forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new virtual-model
control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators,
without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment.
Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by
virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through
analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior
settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator
demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter
slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same
controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and
adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and
platform independence.

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in orchards presents
significant challenges due to obstacles and GPS-deprived environments. In this
work, we introduce a learning-based approach to achieve vision-based navigation
of UAVs within orchard rows. Our method employs a variational autoencoder
(VAE)-based controller, trained with an intervention-based learning framework
that allows the UAV to learn a visuomotor policy from human experience. We
validate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built
quadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few
iterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously
navigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller
exhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying
distances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.
Furthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel
environments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions
and speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds
significant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in
orchard monitoring and management.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Conclusion: Manip4Care能有效提升机器人在辅助护理中的肢体操作能力，尤其在动态环境中。

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance
their ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility
impairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and
dressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the
human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address
this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables
robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our
approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for
grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision
avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with
force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to
generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical
constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks
in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age
groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our
approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further
showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MARS的多模态检索与选择方法，用于提升基于LLM的自动语音识别（LLM-ASR）在对话场景中的性能，通过动态选择最相关的历史上下文来减少冗余和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话LLM-ASR方法使用固定数量的历史对话或全部历史作为上下文，导致识别混淆和高计算成本。

Method: MARS通过多模态检索获取候选历史上下文，并基于声学和文本相似性选择最佳上下文。

Result: 在Interspeech 2025数据集上，MARS使仅用1.5K小时数据训练的LLM-ASR性能优于使用179K小时数据训练的当前最优系统。

Conclusion: MARS方法显著提升了对话LLM-ASR的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to convert human speech content into
corresponding text. In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context
can enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional
long-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR
(LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech,
which has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing
conversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or
the entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR
confusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant
information. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method
named MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and
select the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the
current utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of
candidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual
similarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the
acoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical
context and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider
both similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the
Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge
dataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and
equipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system
trained on 179K hours of data.

Abstract: AI-based voice analysis shows promise for disease diagnostics, but existing

We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific

warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC),
with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice

significantly outperforms existing audio large language models across the MuCUE
tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art effectiveness and generalization

Conclusion: 研究为实践者选择适合的生物声学分类任务模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and
conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse
bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale
pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their
transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview
bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources
and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by
thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining
scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation
models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing
the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive
probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that
BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised
objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS,
BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model,
is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to
extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and
Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain
competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in
linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages
over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the
baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms
bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings
provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to
adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.

Motivation: 现有方法直接从原始音频学习音乐理论存在困难，导致歌曲生成的可控性、泛化性、感知质量和时长问题。

Method: BACH采用符号化策略和分层歌曲结构生成方法，支持人工编辑的符号乐谱。

Result: BACH在效率、时长和感知质量上显著提升，成为公开报告中的最优系统，甚至超越商业方案。

Conclusion: BACH通过符号化方法解决了歌曲生成的核心问题，展示了其在主观评价中的优越性。

Abstract: Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC;
nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent
limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and
duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing
paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task
that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we
present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly
designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH
introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored
to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in
the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation.
Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new
SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing
commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority across multiple subjective metrics.

TL;DR: PESTO是一种自监督学习方法，用于单音高估计，采用Siamese架构和Toeplitz全连接层，无需标注数据即可训练，性能优越且轻量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单音高估计问题，同时避免对标注数据的依赖，并实现轻量化和实时性。

Method: 使用Siamese架构处理VQT帧，通过Toeplitz全连接层实现平移等变性，采用类基平移等变目标训练。

Result: 在音乐和语音数据集上表现优于自监督基线，甚至与监督方法竞争，具有出色的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: PESTO是一种高效、轻量且适用于实时应用的音高估计方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for
single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes
individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch
distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to
translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition,
we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and
train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,
eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and
training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very
lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets
(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms
self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting
superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical
utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached
convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and
minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time
applications.

TL;DR: ShrutiSense是一个针对印度古典音乐的符号音高处理系统，通过两种互补模型（FST和GC-SHMM）实现音高校正和旋律补全，在模拟数据上表现出高准确性和文化真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号音乐处理工具未能考虑印度古典音乐中的微音程（22 shrutis）和特定raga语法，导致表达失真。

Method: 采用Shruti-aware FST进行音高校正，GC-SHMM结合raga语法规则完成旋律补全。

Result: 在模拟数据上，FST模型shruti分类准确率达91.3%，旋律补全准确率为86.7-90.0%，且对音高噪声（±50音分）表现稳健。

Conclusion: ShrutiSense有效解决了印度古典音乐的音高处理问题，保持了文化表达的准确性。

Abstract: Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22
shrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone
equal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to
account for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars
that govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic
pitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two
critical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and
(2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs
complementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state
transducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti
framework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that
incorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions.
Comprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that
ShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for
correction tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at
corruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under
pitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas
(90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical
music expression.

Motivation: 现有旋律缩减方法（如生成调性音乐理论）不完全自动化且局限于古典音乐，本文旨在提出一种更通用且自动化的方法。

Method: 使用图表示和最短路径算法进行旋律缩减，适用于流行、民谣和古典音乐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的旋律缩减更忠实于原曲且音乐连贯性更强，下游任务中生成变奏曲质量更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在旋律缩减和音乐生成任务中表现优异，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Melody reduction, as an abstract representation of musical compositions,
serves not only as a tool for music analysis but also as an intermediate
representation for structured music generation. Prior computational theories,
such as the Generative Theory of Tonal Music, provide insightful
interpretations of music, but they are not fully automatic and usually limited
to the classical genre. In this paper, we propose a novel and conceptually
simple computational method for melody reduction using a graph-based
representation inspired by principles from computational music theories, where
the reduction process is formulated as finding the shortest path. We evaluate
our algorithm on pop, folk, and classical genres, and experimental results show
that the algorithm produces melody reductions that are more faithful to the
original melody and more musically coherent than other common melody
downsampling methods. As a downstream task, we use melody reductions to
generate symbolic music variations. Experiments show that our method achieves
higher quality than state-of-the-art style transfer methods.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC)方法，以解决Audio Difference Captioning (ADC)在微调过程中导致的语义鸿沟和灾难性遗忘问题。ACC通过捕捉音频间的共享语义而非差异，提升了音频-文本理解能力，并在多个下游任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADC虽然能促进细粒度音频区分，但其差异导向的输出与预训练目标不匹配，导致微调时的灾难性遗忘。因此，需要一种更温和的方法来平衡任务性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ACC方法，鼓励模型捕捉音频间的共享语义，而非强调差异。在多个音频相关任务（如VSC、SER、MIC、MGC）上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，ACC在音频-文本理解任务上表现优于ADC，同时在下游任务中更好地保留了模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: ACC通过关注共享语义，实现了更稳健的跨模态理解，并在泛化与任务性能间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text
cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). To further strengthen this alignment, recent
works have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple
audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby
promoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness
in enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a
notable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound
events-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This
deviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining
objective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably
challenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the
shared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed
differences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively
enhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also
better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related
downstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion
recognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre
classification (MGC), compared to ADC. These findings validate that ACC
contributes to more robust cross-modal understanding and achieves a better
balance between generalization and task-specific performance in the context of
MLLMs.

Abstract: We present Voxlect, a novel benchmark for modeling dialects and regional
languages worldwide using speech foundation models. Specifically, we report
comprehensive benchmark evaluations on dialects and regional language varieties
in English, Arabic, Mandarin and Cantonese, Tibetan, Indic languages, Thai,
Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Italian. Our study used over
2 million training utterances from 30 publicly available speech corpora that
are provided with dialectal information. We evaluate the performance of several
widely used speech foundation models in classifying speech dialects. We assess
the robustness of the dialectal models under noisy conditions and present an
error analysis that highlights modeling results aligned with geographic
continuity. In addition to benchmarking dialect classification, we demonstrate
several downstream applications enabled by Voxlect. Specifically, we show that
Voxlect can be applied to augment existing speech recognition datasets with
dialect information, enabling a more detailed analysis of ASR performance
across dialectal variations. Voxlect is also used as a tool to evaluate the
performance of speech generation systems. Voxlect is publicly available with

Motivation: 解决合成歌声音频与真实录音在高频频谱上的明显差异，提升声码器生成音频的真实性。

Method: 结合线性频谱估计（基于去噪扩散和DiT架构）和改进的Vocos声码器，处理高频频谱。

Result: 生成的音频频谱保真度高，难以被人耳和机器分类器区分。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了声码器技术的真实性，尤其在对抗频谱检测攻击方面。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing the realism of
vocoder-generated singing voice audio by mitigating the distinguishable
disparities between synthetic and real-life recordings, particularly in
high-frequency spectrogram components. Our proposed approach combines two
innovations: an explicit linear spectrogram estimation step using denoising
diffusion process with DiT-based neural network architecture optimized for
time-frequency data, and a redesigned vocoder based on Vocos specialized in
handling large linear spectrograms with increased frequency bins. This
integrated method can produce audio with high-fidelity spectrograms that are
challenging for both human listeners and machine classifiers to differentiate
from authentic recordings. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate
that our streamlined approach maintains high audio quality while achieving this
realism. This work presents a substantial advancement in overcoming the
limitations of current vocoding techniques, particularly in the context of
adversarial attacks on fake spectrogram detection.

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验结果表明，Poin-HierNet在等错误率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Poin-HierNet通过分层表示和领域不变特征，显著提升了音频深度伪造检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) faces critical generalization challenges due
to diverse real-world spoofing attacks and domain variations. However, existing
methods primarily rely on Euclidean distances, failing to adequately capture
the intrinsic hierarchical structures associated with attack categories and
domain factors. To address these issues, we design a novel framework
Poin-HierNet to construct domain-invariant hierarchical representations in the
Poincar\'e sphere. Poin-HierNet includes three key components: 1) Poincar\'e
Prototype Learning (PPL) with several data prototypes aligning sample features
and capturing multilevel hierarchies beyond human labels; 2) Hierarchical
Structure Learning (HSL) leverages top prototypes to establish a tree-like
hierarchical structure from data prototypes; and 3) Poincar\'e Feature
Whitening (PFW) enhances domain invariance by applying feature whitening to
suppress domain-sensitive features. We evaluate our approach on four datasets:
ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 2021 LA, ASVspoof 2021 DF, and In-The-Wild.
Experimental results demonstrate that Poin-HierNet exceeds state-of-the-art
methods in Equal Error Rate.

Motivation: 研究NVVs的动机源于其在情感和副语言信息传递中的重要性，以及现有研究方法（如孤立样本）的局限性。

Method: 通过历史回顾、类型和功能分析，提出基于语料库的方法来解决NVVs研究中的隐私和数据稀疏问题。

Result: NVVs在情感研究中具有重要价值，但现有方法难以真实建模，语料库方法提供了更现实的解决方案。

Conclusion: 语料库方法是研究NVVs的有效途径，但仍需解决隐私和数据稀疏问题。

Abstract: Non-Verbal Vocalisations (NVVs) are short `non-word' utterances without
proper linguistic (semantic) meaning but conveying connotations -- be this
emotions/affects or other paralinguistic information. We start this
contribution with a historic sketch: how they were addressed in psychology and
linguistics in the last two centuries, how they were neglected later on, and
how they came to the fore with the advent of emotion research. We then give an
overview of types of NVVs (formal aspects) and functions of NVVs, exemplified
with the typical NVV \textit{ah}. Interesting as they are, NVVs come, however,
with a bunch of challenges that should be accounted for: Privacy and general
ethical considerations prevent them of being recorded in real-life (private)
scenarios to a sufficient extent. Isolated, prompted (acted) exemplars do not
necessarily model NVVs in context; yet, this is the preferred strategy so far
when modelling NVVs, especially in AI. To overcome these problems, we argue in
favour of corpus-based approaches. This guarantees a more realistic modelling;
however, we are still faced with privacy and sparse data problems.

Motivation: 在内容驱动的部分操纵下，音频-视觉时间深度伪造定位任务极具挑战性，因为伪造区域通常仅跨越少数帧。

Method: HBMNet包含三个模块：音频-视觉特征编码器、粗粒度提案生成器和细粒度概率生成器，结合多尺度线索和双向边界-内容关系。

Conclusion: HBMNet通过多模块协作和模态增强，显著提升了深度伪造定位性能，并显示出更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial
manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake
regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest
remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical
Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an
Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level
representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary
regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these
proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality
perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and
fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From
the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional
boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion
primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each
module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes
complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet
outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with
more training data.

Result: 在无监督去混响方法中表现优越，平衡了采样效率和RIR先验建模。

Conclusion: USD-DPS是一种有效的无监督去混响方法，适用于多通道语音处理。

Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-channel single-speaker blind
dereverberation, where multi-channel mixtures are used to recover the clean
anechoic speech. To solve this problem, we propose USD-DPS, {U}nsupervised
{S}peech {D}ereverberation via {D}iffusion {P}osterior {S}ampling. USD-DPS uses
an unconditional clean speech diffusion model as a strong prior to solve the
problem by posterior sampling. At each diffusion sampling step, we estimate all
microphone channels' room impulse responses (RIRs), which are further used to
enforce a multi-channel mixture consistency constraint for diffusion guidance.
For multi-channel RIR estimation, we estimate reference-channel RIR by
optimizing RIR parameters of a sub-band RIR signal model, with the Adam
optimizer. We estimate non-reference channels' RIRs analytically using forward
convolutive prediction (FCP). We found that this combination provides a good
balance between sampling efficiency and RIR prior modeling, which shows
superior performance among unsupervised dereverberation approaches. An audio

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频大语言模型（ALLM）在语音处理中的广泛应用，其安全性问题亟待解决。音频的独特性使得传统的文本和视觉安全研究无法直接适用，因此需要专门研究ALLM的安全隐患。

Method: 论文提出了HIN攻击框架，通过修改音频波形（如调整时间动态和注入定制噪声）嵌入隐蔽的后门触发器，并开发了AudioSafe基准测试评估ALLM的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验发现：(I) 环境噪声和语速变化等音频特征攻击成功率超过90%；(II) ALLM对不同音频特征的敏感性差异显著；(III) 后门样本仅导致损失曲线轻微波动，攻击隐蔽性强。

Conclusion: ALLM对音频特征的后门攻击高度脆弱，现有模型需加强防御措施，AudioSafe为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech
processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While
considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct
characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates:
Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In
response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel
backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features.
HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations
to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise.
These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature
encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To
evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the
AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments
on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical
vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise
and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II)
ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features,
particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III)
poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations,
highlighting the attack's stealth.

Conclusion: 基于ASR特征的SQ预测器在性能和适应性上表现优异。

Abstract: There has been significant research effort developing neural-network-based
predictors of SQ in recent years. While a primary objective has been to develop
non-intrusive, i.e.~reference-free, metrics to assess the performance of SE
systems, recent work has also investigated the direct inference of neural SQ
predictors within the loss function of downstream speech tasks. To aid in the
training of SQ predictors, several large datasets of audio with corresponding
human labels of quality have been created. Recent work in this area has shown
that speech representations derived from large unsupervised or semi-supervised
foundational speech models are useful input feature representations for neural
SQ prediction. In this work, a novel and robust SQ predictor is proposed based
on feature representations extracted from an ASR model, found to be a powerful
input feature for the SQ prediction task. The proposed system achieves higher
correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches on all NISQA test
sets and shows significantly better domain adaption compared to the commonly
used DNSMOS metric.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StutterCut是一种半监督框架，将不流畅性分割问题转化为图分割问题，利用弱标签训练伪预言分类器，并在真实和合成数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多在不流畅性分类上停留在语句级别，无法满足实时反馈和精准分割的需求。

Method: 将语音嵌入表示为图节点，通过伪预言分类器和蒙特卡洛dropout的不确定性度量优化节点连接。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，StutterCut的F1分数更高，不流畅性起始检测更精准。

Conclusion: StutterCut为不流畅性分割提供了更有效的解决方案，尤其在真实数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting and segmenting dysfluencies is crucial for effective speech therapy
and real-time feedback. However, most methods only classify dysfluencies at the
utterance level. We introduce StutterCut, a semi-supervised framework that
formulates dysfluency segmentation as a graph partitioning problem, where
speech embeddings from overlapping windows are represented as graph nodes. We
refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained
on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an
uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the
weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency
boundaries for four dysfluency types. This provides a more realistic benchmark
compared to synthetic datasets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that StutterCut outperforms existing methods, achieving higher F1 scores and
more precise stuttering onset detection.

Motivation: COPD是一种严重影响生活质量的疾病，早期非侵入性检测对改善患者预后至关重要。语音作为一种潜在生物标志物，其跨语言有效性尚待验证。

Method: 收集96名丹麦参与者的语音数据（阅读、咳嗽、持续元音），其中一半为COPD患者，另一半为健康对照组。使用openSMILE特征和x-vector嵌入分析。

Result: 基于openSMILE特征和逻辑回归的模型达到67%的准确率，支持语音分析作为COPD筛查工具的潜力。

Conclusion: 语音分析有望成为未来COPD医疗解决方案中非侵入性、远程和可扩展的筛查工具。

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a serious and debilitating
disease affecting millions around the world. Its early detection using
non-invasive means could enable preventive interventions that improve quality
of life and patient outcomes, with speech recently shown to be a valuable
biomarker. Yet, its validity across different linguistic groups remains to be
seen. To that end, audio data were collected from 96 Danish participants
conducting three speech tasks (reading, coughing, sustained vowels). Half of
the participants were diagnosed with different levels of COPD and the other
half formed a healthy control group. Subsequently, we investigated different
baseline models using openSMILE features and learnt x-vector embeddings. We
obtained a best accuracy of 67% using openSMILE features and logistic
regression. Our findings support the potential of speech-based analysis as a
non-invasive, remote, and scalable screening tool as part of future COPD
healthcare solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过推理时间缩放和验证器-算法组合来提升音频超分辨率质量的新方法，显著优于传统扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型通过增加采样步数提升音频超分辨率质量，但受限于随机采样过程的高方差和质量上限。

Method: 采用推理时间缩放和多轨迹探索策略，结合任务特定验证器和两种搜索算法（随机搜索和零阶搜索）。

Result: 在多种音频领域和频段验证中，性能显著提升，如语音超分辨率的美学评分提升9.70%，频谱距离改善46.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过主动引导高维解空间探索，实现了更稳健和高质量的音频超分辨率输出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks,
including audio super-resolution (SR). In many applications like movie
post-production and album mastering, substantial computational budgets are
available for achieving superior audio quality. However, while existing
diffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the
performance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the
sampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs. Here,
rather than simply increasing the number of sampling steps, we propose a
different paradigm through inference-time scaling for SR, which explores
multiple solution trajectories during the sampling process. Different
task-specific verifiers are developed, and two search algorithms, including the
random search and zero-order search for SR, are introduced. By actively guiding
the exploration of the high-dimensional solution space through
verifier-algorithm combinations, we enable more robust and higher-quality
outputs. Through extensive validation across diverse audio domains (speech,
music, sound effects) and frequency ranges, we demonstrate consistent
performance gains, achieving improvements of up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88%
in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral
distance for speech SR from 4kHz to 24kHz, showcasing the effectiveness of our
approach. Audio samples are available at:

Result: 研究发现收益递减现象，且Transformer架构后性能趋于稳定。模型选择对进展感知有显著影响。

Conclusion: SER研究已进入平台期，未来需探索新方向以突破现有瓶颈。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has long benefited from the adoption of deep
learning methodologies. Deeper models -- with more layers and more trainable
parameters -- are generally perceived as being `better' by the SER community.
This raises the question -- \emph{how much better} are modern-era deep neural
networks compared to their earlier iterations? Beyond that, the more important
question of how to move forward remains as poignant as ever. SER is far from a
solved problem; therefore, identifying the most prominent avenues of future
research is of paramount importance. In the present contribution, we attempt a
quantification of progress in the 15 years of research beginning with the
introduction of the landmark 2009 INTERSPEECH Emotion Challenge. We conduct a
large scale investigation of model architectures, spanning both audio-based
models that rely on speech inputs and text-baed models that rely solely on
transcriptions. Our results point towards diminishing returns and a plateau
after the recent introduction of transformer architectures. Moreover, we
demonstrate how perceptions of progress are conditioned on the particular
selection of models that are compared. Our findings have important
repercussions about the state-of-the-art in SER research and the paths forward

Motivation: 音频深度伪造的泛滥威胁数字通信信任，现有方法在模型溯源方面研究不足。

Method: 使用卷积自编码器提取注意力增强的潜在表示，结合两个分类器（ADA和ADMR）进行技术识别和模型实例识别，并引入置信度阈值提高鲁棒性。

Result: ADA分类器F1分数超过95%，ADMR模块在六类中达到96.31%宏F1，对未见攻击也表现稳健。

Conclusion: LAVA为开放集条件下的深度伪造溯源和模型识别提供了有效解决方案，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in
digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing
audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial
challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice
Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model
recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted
by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized
classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which
identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition
(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve
robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection
thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong
performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all
datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.
Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation
analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the
field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model
recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and
accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available

Abstract: Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives aim to enhance transparency and public
participation by making government data openly accessible. However, structuring
legal norms for machine readability remains a critical challenge for advancing
Legal Tech applications such as Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs). Focusing on the

LexML standard), multilingual support, versioning in the Official Journal, and
inter-norm relationships (e.g., citations and references). Our structured

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在引用网页内容时的不透明行为及其对生态系统的影响。

Method: 基于14,000个真实对话日志，分析LLMs的搜索和引用行为，并使用负二项障碍模型量化归属差距。

Result: 发现LLMs普遍存在未搜索、未引用或低引用行为，且不同模型的引用效率差异显著。

Conclusion: 建议采用标准化的搜索架构和完整的搜索痕迹披露以提高透明度。

Abstract: Web-enabled LLMs frequently answer queries without crediting the web pages
they consume, creating an "attribution gap" - the difference between relevant
URLs read and those actually cited. Drawing on approximately 14,000 real-world
LMArena conversation logs with search-enabled LLM systems, we document three
exploitation patterns: 1) No Search: 34% of Google Gemini and 24% of OpenAI
GPT-4o responses are generated without explicitly fetching any online content;
2) No citation: Gemini provides no clickable citation source in 92% of answers;
3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant
pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model
shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3
relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained
by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation
efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited
- varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries,
underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem
impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on
standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

Conclusion: 结论呼吁在专利管理中采用协作、透明和伦理导向的方法，促进创新中的公平获取。

Abstract: In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into not
only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage
containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation.
This chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science,
by focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as
fundamentally tied to the global movement of scientific and technological
knowledge. With a focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents,
and international competition with patents, this work considers how new
technologies are challenging traditional notions of inventorship, access, and
moral accountability.The chapter provides a critical analysis of AI's
implications for patent authorship and prior art searches, ownership issues
arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology to ethical dilemmas, and the
problem of using patents for strategic advantage in a global context of
innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified the importance
of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality,
implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical
contemplation about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems.
Ultimately, the chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and
ethically-based approach in managing knowledge in the patenting environment
highlighting the role for information professionals and policy to contribute to
access equity in innovation.

Motivation: 生物成像技术生成的多维数据规模庞大，但元数据管理和互操作性仍是主要问题。

Method: 采用两层架构：核心层基于现有生物医学本体提供类中心结构，实例层将实际数据集信息表示为RDF个体并与核心类链接。

Result: 该框架支持灵活的数据实例与严格的本体类结合，实现无缝集成和高级语义查询。

Conclusion: SSBD本体提高了互操作性、数据重用和生物机制发现，符合FAIR原则。

Abstract: Advanced bioimaging technologies have enabled the large-scale acquisition of
multidimensional data, yet effective metadata management and interoperability
remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose a new
ontology-driven framework for the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics
Database (SSBD) that adopts a two-tier architecture. The core layer provides a
class-centric structure referencing existing biomedical ontologies, supporting
both SSBD:repository -- which focuses on rapid dataset publication with minimal
metadata -- and SSBD:database, which is enhanced with biological and
imaging-related annotations. Meanwhile, the instance layer represents actual
imaging dataset information as Resource Description Framework individuals that
are explicitly linked to the core classes. This layered approach aligns
flexible instance data with robust ontological classes, enabling seamless
integration and advanced semantic queries. By coupling flexibility with rigor,
the SSBD Ontology promotes interoperability, data reuse, and the discovery of
novel biological mechanisms. Moreover, our solution aligns with the Recommended
Metadata for Biological Images guidelines and fosters compatibility.
Ultimately, our approach contributes to establishing a Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable data ecosystem within the bioimaging community.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在LSM树中引入学习型数据结构以减少读取放大和内存开销的两种方法，分别通过选择性绕过Bloom过滤器和使用学习型模型替代传统Bloom过滤器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LSM树设计在写入优化时引入显著的读取放大，辅助结构如Bloom过滤器虽有效但内存开销大。学习型数据结构提供了数据自适应行为的潜力。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 使用分类器选择性绕过Bloom过滤器以减少查询延迟；2) 用学习型模型和小型备份过滤器替代传统Bloom过滤器以减少内存占用。

Result: 实验表明，分类器方法减少30%的Bloom过滤器检查，降低查询延迟2.28倍；学习型Bloom过滤器减少内存70-80%且无假阴性。

Conclusion: 两种方法展示了在延迟、内存和正确性之间的互补权衡，突显了学习型索引组件在写入优化存储系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for
write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.
Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that
scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data
structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these
components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this
work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the
LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom
filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query
latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned
models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without
compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style
LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic
workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up
to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,
though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design
achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory
usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary
trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the
potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

Motivation: 传统均匀性测试仅关注预设距离的差距问题，未能捕捉实际场景中的多样性，可能导致性能不佳。

Method: 引入均匀性跟踪问题，利用泊松混合结构的新结果，设计了一种竞争性算法。

Result: 提出了一种具有polylog(opt)竞争比的均匀性跟踪算法。

Conclusion: 均匀性跟踪问题更贴近实际需求，新算法在性能上具有竞争力。

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an
unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide
whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total
variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This
question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,
by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of
interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a
prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity
tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity
(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be
competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in
hindsight. Our main contribution is a
$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking
algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on
Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP在视觉诊断和脑机接口中应用广泛，但传统方法因眼疲劳和PWM精度问题限制了实际部署。

Method: 使用50%至95%占空比的PWM刺激，通过定制LED硬件记录EEG数据，测试10名受试者。

Result: 高占空比（85%）显著减少视觉疲劳，且SSVEP响应性能达到峰值。

Conclusion: 85%占空比的视觉刺激可有效解决SSVEP应用中的疲劳问题，推动其实际应用。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on
the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter
methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for
new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction
mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable
challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several
state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular
representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where
chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper
introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a
hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core,
Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes
3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a
3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two
pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and
reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a
progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With
prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional
performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task
prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10
datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing
methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.
This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular
computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic
reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism
understanding.

TL;DR: FastCSP是一种基于机器学习原子间势的高通量晶体结构预测工作流，通过结合随机结构生成和几何优化，显著降低了计算成本，并在28种分子上验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子晶体的晶体结构预测（CSP）在制药和有机电子等领域至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且耗时。

Method: FastCSP结合Genarris 3.0随机结构生成和UMA机器学习原子间势进行几何弛豫与自由能计算。

Result: 在28种分子上测试，FastCSP能准确生成已知实验结构，并将其能量排名控制在全局最小值5 kJ/mol以内。

Conclusion: FastCSP的通用性和高效性消除了对经典力场和DFT的需求，显著降低了CSP的门槛。

Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role
in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is
challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large
search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few
kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)
provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a
large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source,
high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with
geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the
Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of
28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently
generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per
molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs
can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning.
Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for
classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with
DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly
lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be
obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal
structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗诊断中的分类和流行率估计提供了统一的误差边界框架，但在多分类问题中仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study
properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in
quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis
tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main
tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be
recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol
{\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine
arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to
demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the
matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity)
yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation.
In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a
measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately
defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also
consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary
solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the
confusion matrix.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有效量化DNN预测不确定性，还为稀疏学习理论在DNN中的应用提供了平台。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to
accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural
networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from
the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic
neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a
validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations.
We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in
particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is
essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence
intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and
achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques.
Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform
to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.

Result: 实验证明Flow IV能准确恢复潜在结果函数，实现非可分离模型中的反事实推理。

Conclusion: Flow IV为复杂因果推理任务提供了新工具，尤其在非可分离模型中表现出色。

Abstract: To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate
causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual
reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this
task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for
mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects.
While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the
population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically
assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under
standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in
treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the
treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed
data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We
implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the
likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the
underlying outcome function. We call our method Flow IV.

Conclusion: 这些方法为因果推断提供了更可靠的预测工具，支持“一图多用”的范式。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite
imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level
wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can
be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training
objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently
suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of
causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing
debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this
attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the
downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in
data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction
methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that
substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled
data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear
transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's
correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address
shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's
learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using
Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods
meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to
training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may
represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference
when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a "one map,
many trials" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces
predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.

Motivation: 现代应用中（如核物理探测器优化），每次实验运行耗时巨大，传统黑盒优化方法在高维空间中表现不佳。

Method: 提出BOMM方法，基于边际均值函数估计全局最优解，使用变换加性高斯过程代理模型实现。

Result: BOMM在数值实验和核物理探测器优化中表现优于传统方法，缓解了维度灾难问题。

Conclusion: BOMM是一种高效的黑盒优化方法，尤其适用于高维问题。

Abstract: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly
used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,
the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require
hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over
a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs
$\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated
inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''
(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address
this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)
approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$
that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently
inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can
select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.
Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with
unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM
estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization
rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,
thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a
practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive
Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector
optimization in nuclear physics.

Abstract: To speed up Gaussian process inference, a number of fast kernel matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM) approximation algorithms have been proposed over the
years. In this paper, we establish an exact fast kernel MVM algorithm based on
exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution
functions, compatible with a class of kernels which includes multivariate
Mat\'ern kernels with half-integer smoothness parameter. This algorithm uses a
divide-and-conquer approach, during which sorting outputs are stored in a data
structure. We also propose a new algorithm to take into account some linear
fixed effects predictor function. Our numerical experiments confirm that our
algorithm is very effective for low-dimensional Gaussian process inference
problems with hundreds of thousands of data points. An implementation of our

Conclusion: SMRL通过考虑表示空间与原始特征空间的相关性，解决了分布平衡与信息损失之间的权衡问题，提升了估计准确性。

Abstract: Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest
from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment
effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation
learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by
introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the
baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high
dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers
to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the
proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation
error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information
loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space
and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with
simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure
Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic
health record data from the MIMIC-III database.

Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the
development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for
addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of
determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In
large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of
tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In
this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from
the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to
perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative
approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We
highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs
that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the
advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

Conclusion: FreB通过提供有效性保证和可解释的诊断，为科学推断提供了可信赖的工具，尤其是在无法直接评估似然性的情况下。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data
structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples.
Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models
to ``inverse problems'' to infer hidden parameters from observed data. While
these methods can handle intractable models and large-scale studies, they can
also produce biased or overconfident conclusions. We present a solution with
Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes
AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that
consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while
achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate
FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences:
identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing
theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in
observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable
diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where
direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤MRI的准确分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在更大、更异构的数据集上表现不足。

Method: 第一阶段使用扩散概率模型进行跨模态合成，生成残差图作为空间先验；第二阶段用轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态数据进行分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，Dice得分为93.02%，IoU为86.7%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界多中心MRI数据上表现出更高的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,

Result: 在八个公共2D和3D数据集上达到最优性能，包括在未见数据集上的零样本测试。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医学图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

Motivation: 通过MRI合成淀粉样PET扫描，提供一种低成本、大规模的阿尔茨海默病筛查方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上，CoCoLIT在图像质量和淀粉样阳性分类上显著优于现有方法，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: CoCoLIT为MRI到PET的跨模态翻译提供了一种高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible
structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for
large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence
that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless
encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered
through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural
complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing
MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a
lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more
effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned
Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that
incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss
(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)
a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an
existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference
consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for
MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available
datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

TL;DR: 该研究通过迁移学习解决了传统CNN在医学图像分类中需要大量计算资源和训练数据的问题，比较了EfficientNetV2、EfficientNet和ResNet50在脑肿瘤分类中的表现，发现EfficientNetV2性能最优但训练时间更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在医学图像分类中需要大量计算资源和训练数据，限制了其应用。

Method: 采用迁移学习，比较EfficientNetV2、EfficientNet和ResNet50在脑肿瘤分类中的表现。

Result: EfficientNetV2性能最优，但训练时间更长。

Conclusion: EfficientNetV2在医学图像分类中表现优异，但需权衡性能与训练时间。

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the
interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand
extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these
limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong
classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the
study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with
ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and
pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior
performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the
cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D模型优化中的梯度消失问题，并利用性别分类等辅助任务提升大脑年龄预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并在年龄和性别子组中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DSMT-AE框架通过多任务学习和深度监督显著提升了大脑年龄预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)
T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker
for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage
comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing
spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains
challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain
structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging
trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making
sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of
predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised
Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE
employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at
intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and
multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our
framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary
tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively
capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction
accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark
(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.
Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component
substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of
the overall architecture.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种VLMs在MedFMC数据集上的表现，Qwen2.5在多项任务中表现最佳，但所有模型在复杂任务（如视网膜眼底检查）中表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源VLMs在医学图像诊断中的性能，为临床应用的可行性提供依据。

Method: 使用MedFMC数据集，比较五种VLMs在三种实验设置（仅视觉输入、多模态输入、链式思维推理）下的诊断准确性。

Result: Qwen2.5在多项任务中表现最佳，但多模态输入和链式思维推理未显著提升准确性，复杂任务表现较差。

Conclusion: 开源VLMs在医学诊断中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以适应复杂临床任务。

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3,
Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes
22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease
multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy
(colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin
color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic
retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental
settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical
comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved
the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images
(84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon
pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both
significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice
assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading
accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All
models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the
highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly
better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input
reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning
prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated
promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph
interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal
fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and
domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SWAN的新框架，结合小波变换和注意力机制，用于红外小目标检测，显著提升了复杂背景下的检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在民用和军事领域至关重要，但现有方法依赖传统卷积操作，难以区分目标和复杂背景的频域特征。

Method: SWAN框架结合Haar小波卷积（HWConv）、移位空间注意力（SSA）和残差双通道注意力（RDCA），实现跨域特征融合和背景干扰抑制。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，SWAN优于现有方法，显著提高了检测精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SWAN通过频域和空间域协同感知，有效解决了复杂背景下红外小目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and
military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in
complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional
convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and
struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small
targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework
designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN
leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion
of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a
Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial
dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual
awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively
calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference
while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods,
showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LoRA的改进方法（CP-LoRA和DoRA变体），用于动脉瘤性蛛网膜下腔出血（SAH）的医学图像分割，显著优于传统Unet微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤性SAH是一种高死亡率的神经急症，现有方法在有限数据集上的表现有待提升。通过迁移学习从相关血肿类型中提取知识是一种潜在但未被充分探索的解决方案。

Method: 采用预训练的Unet架构，基于124例创伤性脑损伤患者的CT扫描数据，并在30例SAH患者数据上进行微调。提出了基于张量CP分解的CP-LoRA方法和DoRA变体，并与现有LoRA方法进行比较。

Result: LoRA方法在SAH分割任务中表现优于传统Unet微调，CP-LoRA在参数效率上表现突出。所有方法在大出血量情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究表明，血肿类型间的迁移学习可行，且基于LoRA的方法在SAH分割任务中显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological
emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related
hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach.
Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image
segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been
rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We
implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from
124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then
fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health
System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based
on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,
CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional
components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,
convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a
multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard
Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods
showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable
performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.
Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance
than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer
learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods
significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测EGFR突变状态有助于临床决策，尤其是在东南亚人群中突变率较高的情况下。

Method: 使用视觉变换器（ViT）和注意力多实例学习（ABMIL）架构构建深度学习框架。

Result: 模型在内部测试集（AUC 0.933）和外部测试集（AUC 0.965）中表现一致且优异。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源有限的环境中也能高效训练，为EGFR突变预测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of
LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can
help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a
routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping,
especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher
incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent
progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and
classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built
on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and
attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR
mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data
from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets:
Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from
TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets,
with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and
external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently
trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to
several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study
demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status
using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using
foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法对扩散MRI信息利用不足，导致分割性能较低。

Method: 提出DCLNet，引入纤维追踪获取的粗标签与专家标注的精确标签协作学习，并设计模态自适应编码模块（MEM）实现结构MRI与扩散MRI的软信息交换。

Result: 在HCP数据集上的实验表明，DCLNet相比单标签网络性能有所提升。

Conclusion: 双标签策略能有效解决颅神经分割任务中的固有模糊性问题。

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative
methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical
pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved
promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion
MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In
this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning
Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our
DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber
tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels
annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder
Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and
diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human
Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared
to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the
effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in
CNs parcellation tasks.

Result: 模型在预测注意力扫描路径方面优于随机和基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型工具可帮助病理学学员学习如何像专家一样分配注意力。

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to
decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to
predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists'
attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We
characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m
(magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital
microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs,
and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths
constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction
algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in
the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use
these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the
dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate
attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based
sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different
magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by
sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner
using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging
multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental
results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline
models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in
learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学图像的无损压缩和安全性提供了有效解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in
lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for
medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is
critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an
adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global
and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a
segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to
ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based
low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our
proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The
source code will be made

Conclusion: 大感受野与放射组学结合有效，未来可进一步优化集成方法和临床变量整合。

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as
pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both
segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI
dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage
training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels
using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned
features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen
validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of
0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR
classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic
features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast
DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some
subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive
fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on
advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further
improve performance and generalization. Code:

Conclusion: AMBER-AFNO在3D医学数据分割中具有高效性和竞争力，为模型轻量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote
sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally
designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D
medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture
with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head
self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of
attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through
frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This
design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to
UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art
architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical
datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO
achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training
efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

Conclusion: REACT-KD在真实世界诊断中具有潜力，决策曲线分析显示其临床效益高。

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains
a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations,
and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a
Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that
transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a
lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design:
one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT,
and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded
low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two
complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits
distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph
distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent
attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD
introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial
or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an
internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose
levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD
consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds,
supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics. Code is available at

Result: 在多种RIC任务中实现了最先进的性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了现有RIC解决方案的瓶颈，为该领域设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to
its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system.
Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods
intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by
incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma,
we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the
underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero
Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle,
we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which
eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development
of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative
networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced
skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across
diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and
image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a
new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in

magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like
artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses
needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view
conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point
Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and
accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that
refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving
splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and
real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR
improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These
results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT
reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

*Biagio Brattoli,Jack Shi,Jongchan Park,Taebum Lee,Donggeun Yoo,Sergio Pereira*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多种多实例学习（MIL）技术，用于检测六种关键的非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）驱动突变，并提出了一种新型非对称Transformer解码器模型，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基因检测对NSCLC治疗决策至关重要，但其广泛应用受限于可用性和耗时问题。机器学习方法虽具潜力，但现有研究多限于少数常见突变，限制了临床价值。

Method: 研究采用多种MIL技术，并引入非对称Transformer解码器模型，通过不同维度的查询和键值提取信息，同时直接利用组织类型以解决MIL的局限性。

Result: 该方法平均性能优于现有MIL模型3%，在罕见突变（如ERBB2和BRAF）预测中提升超过4%。

Conclusion: 该研究为ML在基因检测中的实际应用提供了可行方案，显著提升了突变检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes.
Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains
challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine
Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential
solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations,
limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can
benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK,
BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric
Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying
dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently
extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks,
proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to
directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation
where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting
biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of
3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving
ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic
testing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Star-Diff的结构感知染色恢复扩散模型，用于从H&E染色虚拟生成IHC图像，解决了现有方法在图像对齐和结构保持上的问题，并通过新的评价指标SFS验证了其临床诊断一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏分子诊断信息，而IHC虽能提供关键生物标志物信息，但成本高且耗时。虚拟染色技术有望填补这一空白，但面临图像对齐和结构保持的挑战。

Method: 提出Star-Diff模型，结合残差和噪声生成路径，将虚拟染色任务重新定义为图像恢复任务，并引入SFS指标评估生成图像的临床诊断一致性。

Result: 在BCI数据集上，Star-Diff在视觉保真度和诊断相关性上均达到SOTA性能，且推理速度快，适合临床应用。

Conclusion: Star-Diff为虚拟染色提供了一种高效且临床相关的解决方案，尤其适用于术中虚拟IHC合成等场景。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing
tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker
expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly
and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To
address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising
alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of
synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving
structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this
end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and
evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining
restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image
restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,
Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker
variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC
patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a
clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic
degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level
metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment
and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that
Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity
and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it
presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual
IHC synthesis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的双分支U-Net架构（RL-U^2Net），用于多模态3D心脏分割，解决了现有方法的空间不一致性和静态融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态心脏分割在心血管疾病诊断中至关重要，但现有方法存在空间不一致、融合策略静态及特征对齐与分割效率低的问题。

Method: 采用双分支U-Net并行处理CT和MRI，引入RL-XAlign模块进行特征对齐，结合强化学习和跨模态注意力机制，最后通过集成学习生成分割结果。

Result: 在MM-WHS 2017数据集上，CT和MRI的Dice系数分别达到93.1%和87.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RL-U^2Net在多模态心脏分割中表现出高效性和优越性，为临床诊断提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解复杂系统中决策的因果推理，尤其是安全相关问题，需要形式化的理论支持。

Method: 采用过渡系统方法和模态逻辑，引入干预算子和分离合取，结合Halpern和Pearl的结构因果模型。

Result: 通过分布式系统中的微服务决策案例验证了框架的适用性。

Conclusion: 该工作统一了系统行为的形构化理论与反事实推理，为复杂交互系统中的因果决策研究提供了逻辑基础。

Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for understanding decision-making about the
behaviour of complex `ecosystems' of systems that underpin modern society, with
security -- including issues around correctness, safety, resilience, etc. --
typically providing critical examples. We present a theory of strategic
reasoning about system modelling based on minimal structural assumptions and
employing the methods of transition systems, supported by a modal logic of
system states in the tradition of van Benthem, Hennessy, and Milner, and
validated through equivalence theorems. Our framework introduces an
intervention operator and a separating conjunction to capture actual causal
relationships between component systems of the ecosystem, aligning naturally
with Halpern and Pearl's counterfactual approach based on Structural Causal
Models. We illustrate the applicability through examples of of decision-making
about microservices in distributed systems. We discuss localized
decision-making through a separating conjunction. This work unifies a formal,
minimalistic notion of system behaviour with a Halpern--Pearl-compatible theory
of counterfactual reasoning, providing a logical foundation for studying
decision making about causality in complex interacting systems.

Motivation: 探索现代大型语言模型基础——变换器在图上的表达能力，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 分析GTs和GPS网络在两种注意力机制下的表现，分别基于实数理论和浮点数实践。

Result: 在实数下，GPS网络与带全局模态的GML表达能力相同；在浮点数下，GPS网络与带计数全局模态的GML等价。GTs也有类似结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GTs和GPS网络在不同条件下的表达能力，为图变换器的理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively
little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the
expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and
GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average
hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with
real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that
in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO),
GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with
the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally
expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is
absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We
also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic
with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for
floats).

Motivation: 音乐活动对BLV人群有益，但缺乏系统化的技术设计知识整理。

Method: 通过分类现有研究（技术类型和BLV参与程度），提出六类技术和四大设计目标趋势。

Result: 识别出四大关键设计方向（空间感知、信息获取、非语言交流、记忆），并指出当前研究缺乏实证和真实场景测试。

Conclusion: 呼吁转向‘包容性技术’，强调协作音乐技术和真实测试的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review of music technology
tailored for blind and low vision (BLV) individuals. Music activities can be
particularly beneficial for BLV people. However, a systematic approach to
organizing knowledge on designing accessible technology for BLV people has yet
to be attempted. We categorize the existing studies based on the type of
technology and the extent of BLV people's involvement in the research. We
identify six main categories of BLV people-oriented music technology and
highlight four key trends in design goals. Based on these categories, we
propose four general insights focusing on (1) spatial awareness, (2) access to
information, (3) (non-verbal) communication, and (4) memory. The identified
trends suggest that more empirical studies involving BLV people in real-world
scenarios are needed to ensure that technological advancements can enhance
musical experiences and social inclusion. This research proposes collaborative
music technology and inclusive real-world testing with the target group as two
key areas missing in current research. They serve as a foundational step in
shifting the focus from ``accessible technology'' to ``inclusive technology''
for BLV individuals within the broader field of accessibility research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于材料感知的实时声音合成框架，用于增强AR中虚拟与现实物体交互的真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR中虚拟物体缺乏物理性导致声音交互不自然，影响多感官体验和交互真实感。

Method: 利用计算机视觉识别和分割真实物体的材料，结合物理建模合成实时生成材料相关声音。

Result: 用户研究表明，材料相关声音显著提升了交互真实感和材料区分准确性。

Conclusion: 材料感知的声音交互增强了AR的真实感和对现实环境的感知。

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects.
However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of
natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no
sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory
experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality
(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback
of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that
dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual
congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in
AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer
vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's
physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to
generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.
In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based
sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of
non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that
material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.
Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar
materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings
show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a
stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world
surroundings.

Motivation: 手部姿势和接触事件的准确估计对机器人数据收集、虚拟环境和生物力学分析至关重要，但视觉遮挡和触觉传感限制使其具有挑战性。

Method: VibeMesh集成骨传导扬声器和稀疏压电麦克风，通过结构化声学信号传播推断接触变化，并使用基于图的注意力网络处理多模态信号。

Result: VibeMesh在遮挡或静态接触场景中优于纯视觉基线，提供了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VibeMesh为手部姿势和接触估计提供了一种轻量级、非侵入式的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Abstract: Robotic telepresence enables users to navigate and experience remote

users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these
systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating
location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support
remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that
provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place
through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology
museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our
findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in
the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing
efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential
of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating
FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often
complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid
prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate
initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed
and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of
experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this
approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately
complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating
multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory
retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance
script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution
and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation.
This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows

Conclusion: 双DRL框架有效解决了自适应反馈的挑战，并提升了用户认知表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide
intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to
improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback
could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user
attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL
policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this
trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may
require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose
a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user
performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user
cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the
feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user
performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears?
Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed
to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment
demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry,
economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational
neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic,
multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior
across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior
and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional
tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across
perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as
a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes,
learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts
and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a
phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for
players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress
resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers
effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity),
uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how
clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way
for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to
cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem
designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual
growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines
co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

Abstract: In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an
indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social
science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with
scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies
involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result,
tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the
necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and
low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can
meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by
presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics
support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on
constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development
methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates
both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations
relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical
research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can
also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting
to automate or replace human ethical oversight.

TL;DR: 研究提出通过会议中的发言量可视化人力资本，分析性别、职位等属性对发言量的影响，并验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量化方法未关注对话在人力资本中的核心作用，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用对话可视化技术量化发言量，分析属性差异、参与者影响及连续属性相关性。

Result: 验证了发言量分析方法的有效性，特别是在中小企业周会中的应用。

Conclusion: 发言量可视化是衡量人力资本的有效工具，有助于组织创新和沟通优化。

Abstract: In recent years, many companies have recognized the importance of human
resources and are investing in human capital to revitalize their organizations
and enhance internal communication, thereby fostering innovation. However,
conventional quantification methods have mainly focused on readily measurable
indicators without addressing the fundamental role of conversations in human
capital. This study focuses on routine meetings and proposes strategies to
visualize human capital by analyzing speech amount during these meetings. We
employ conversation visualization technology, which operates effectively, to
quantify speech. We then measure differences in speech amount by attributes
such as gender and job post, changes in speech amount depending on whether
certain participants are present, and correlations between speech amount and
continuous attributes. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we
analyzed speech amounts by departmental affiliation during weekly meetings at
small to medium enterprises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索用户对对话推荐系统（CRS）交互偏好的影响因素。

Method: 采用被试内设计（N=139），参与者体验两种脚本化CRS对话并评分，通过逻辑回归和聚类分析数据。

Result: 探索性偏好由享受感、实用性、新颖性和对话质量预测，聚类揭示五种潜在用户画像。

Conclusion: 研究为CRS用户建模提供情感、认知和特质层面的预测框架，支持动态适应用户需求的对话设计。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised
recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly
support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors
shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this
within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS
dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight
system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the
exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and
conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also
associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user
profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses
indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced
these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level
predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive,
value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework
applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with
evolving user needs.

*Matouš Jelínek,Nadine Schlicker,Ewart de Visser*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了六条设计准则，以优化自动化系统的信任度评估，促进伦理和负责任的人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保用户对系统信任度的感知与其实际信任度一致，以实现安全的系统集成。

Method: 从多领域文献中提取准则，并结合语用学原则（如共同基础和Gricean沟通准则）。

Result: 设计准则有助于提供相关信任度线索，促进校准信任和更满意、高效、安全的交互。

Conclusion: 准则可作为设计工具，帮助创建或评估自动化系统的信任度评估能力。

Abstract: Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for
their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a
system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is
factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate
trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's
trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make
informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system
(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers
optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and
responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived
from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,
cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.
We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically
the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication
maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated
systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped
by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal
norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or
scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed
guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated
systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally
foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe
interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed
heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems
enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.

Conclusion: 研究为基于LLM和人类感知的用户体验改进提供了启示，具有广泛AI应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in
data visualization knowledge tasks. Through systematic comparative analysis of
responses to visualization questions, we find that differences exist between
two ChatGPT models and human outputs over rhetorical structure, knowledge
breadth, and perceptual quality. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT-4, as a more
advanced model, displays a hybrid of characteristics from both humans and
ChatGPT-3.5. The two models were generally favored over human responses, while
their strengths in coverage and breadth, and emphasis on technical and
task-oriented visualization feedback collectively shaped higher overall
quality. Based on our findings, we draw implications for advancing user
experiences based on the potential of LLMs and human perception over their
capabilities, with relevance to broader applications of AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代环境中久坐活动增多，传统体姿估计方法存在遮挡、隐私和灵活性限制，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段生成模型，结合压力传感和椅子形态信息，并通过物理驱动的数据增强提升泛化能力。

Result: 在8名用户和4种椅子上测试，平均关节位置误差为89.4毫米，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ChairPose为姿势感知交互系统提供了新设计空间，适用于人体工程学、医疗和自适应界面。

Abstract: Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments,
raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of
responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as
vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion,
privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We
introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation
system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of
chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on
pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the
inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving
pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we
introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic
variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and
four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of
89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust
generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the
design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications
in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了帮助机器在视觉搜索任务中更有效地辅助人类，需要区分人类的导航意图（简单浏览）和信息意图（搜索目标）。以往方法因固定搜索时间和依赖用户特定数据而受限。

Method: 提出了一种跨用户预测方法，利用公开的EEG和眼动追踪数据集，用户自行决定搜索时间，无需用户特定训练数据。

Result: 在留一用户评估中，跨用户预测准确率达到84.5%，接近用户内预测准确率（85.5%），但更具灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需用户特定数据的情况下，实现了高精度的意图识别，为实际应用提供了更大灵活性。

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks,
they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene
(navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent).
Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e.,
without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to
real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work
used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark
contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.
Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios
that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is
impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first
publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.
informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We
present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG
and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out
evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but
offering much greater flexibility

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: IMUCoCo框架通过将任意位置的IMU信号映射到统一特征空间，支持更灵活的传感器放置，提升运动感知的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU运动感知需固定传感器位置，限制了用户体验。本文旨在解决这一问题，支持任意位置的传感器放置。

Method: 提出IMUCoCo框架，将不同位置的IMU信号基于空间坐标映射到统一特征空间，供下游任务使用。

Result: IMUCoCo在典型和非典型传感器放置下均能实现高精度姿态估计，显著提升了灵活性。

Conclusion: IMUCoCo框架支持用户按需放置传感器，提升了运动感知的适应性和用户体验。

Abstract: IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and
estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in
predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors
and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the
increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited
adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few
well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we
rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured
from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates
(IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs
placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial
coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose
estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo
supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical
sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of
IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place
their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The
framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the
context and suggests placement depending on the use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心律失常监测方法依赖专业医疗设备和患者接触，存在不便和局限性；现有无接触技术对心律失常患者信号分析效果不佳。

Method: 提出mCardiacDx系统，结合PTL技术和编码器-解码器模型，分析反射信号并重建心脉搏波形。

Result: 在健康受试者和心律失常患者的大规模数据集上，mCardiacDx和PTL技术均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: mCardiacDx为心律失常的无接触监测和诊断提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe
complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is
essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as
electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on
specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature.
Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face
significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia
patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.
  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system
that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse
waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our
work include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates
reflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model
that transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.
Our evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients
shows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in
arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in
healthy subjects.

Motivation: 计算机感知技术虽能个性化医疗，但引发隐私和伦理问题，需全面了解利益相关者的观点。

Method: 对102名利益相关者进行半结构化访谈，并进行主题分析。

Result: 识别出七个关键问题领域，并提出个性化路线图作为解决方案。

Conclusion: 个性化路线图为开发者、临床医生和政策制定者提供了实用框架，平衡技术与人文关怀。

Abstract: Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective
computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented
opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy,
bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A
comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation
challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in
real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first
evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational,
technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP
technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers,
frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or
philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a
multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and
consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern
domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific
relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance;
(5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7)
philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic
safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that
predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared,
thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies
between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these
insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for
developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous
behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.

Motivation: 传统外科技能培训依赖专家反馈，但专家资源有限且评估主观性强。AI驱动的自动评估虽可行，但其对技能提升的效果尚不明确。

Method: 开发基于XAI的模拟培训框架，通过分析视频提取技能指标，提供个性化反馈，并与专家基准对比。

Result: XAI反馈显著改善了认知负荷和学员信心，但在性能差距或实践调整方面与传统反馈无显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究支持XAI在外科教育中的应用，并呼吁开发数据驱动的自适应反馈机制。

Abstract: Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet
direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective
assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of
personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of
self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning
have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility
of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill
acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI
(XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We
create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze
videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our
intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee
performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal
execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a
prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of
XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes,
cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results
showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no
differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps
or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects
where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages
the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of
data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning
experiences and competency assessment.

Motivation: 解决基于分组的系统中因丢包导致的语义信息丢失问题，提升语义通信的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用MSTVSC编码语义向量，通过上层协议分组传输；采用3D CNN恢复丢失信息，语义级交织减少集中丢包影响，分解方法优化压缩。

Result: 在90%丢包率下，MS-SSIM大于0.6，PSNR超过20 dB。

Conclusion: MSTVSC系统在极端丢包环境下仍能保持高性能，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits
diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information
loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols,
packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing
erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a
packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication
(MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by
MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To
investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the
packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by
packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using
un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level
interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet
drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is
adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize
redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive
simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an
MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.

Method: 通过实验性战争游戏设计，引入两种非技术性干预措施，测试其对模型行为的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，干预措施显著减少了模型在游戏中的升级行为。

Conclusion: 结论认为，限制大型语言模型在国家安全中的应用为时过早，而应通过干预措施确保其符合国家安全目标。

Abstract: U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models,
including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT)
familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent
studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest
escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We
demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these
tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame
design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the
game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security
applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will
continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting
courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study
acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides
actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including
escalation management.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的广泛应用，评估其在理解物理规律、人类指导和硬约束方面的能力变得至关重要。工程设计问题为AI提供了新的挑战。

Method: Bike-Bench通过量化多种人本和多物理性能特征（如空气动力学、人体工程学等）来评估模型生成的设计。

Result: 实验表明，LLM和表格生成模型在有效性和最优性上不及优化和优化增强的生成模型。

Conclusion: Bike-Bench旨在推动生成式AI在约束多目标工程设计问题中的进步。

Abstract: We introduce Bike-Bench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating
generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and
constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its
capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints
grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the
intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI
capabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs
that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives
and constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered
and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics,
structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text
or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation
results, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a
synthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric,
CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to
evaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid
algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular
generative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented
generative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting
significant room for improvement. We hope Bike-Bench, a first-of-its-kind
benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained
multi-objective engineering design problems. Code, data, and other resources
are published at decode.mit.edu/projects/bikebench/.

Conclusion: EngiBench和EngiOpt为工程设计优化提供了高效、可复现的解决方案，并推动了算法比较和研究的发展。

Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes,
topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given
conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are
difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific
expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first
open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven
engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of
benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more --
that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning
algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a
companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the
EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel
algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage
built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks,
and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments
comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design
problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to
perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for
standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained
design manifolds.

Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum
morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved
electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries.
Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as
the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport
processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop
algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep
convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and
employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous
lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the
latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the
morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This
surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation
framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space
of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the
maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific
surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate
the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties
(specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained
optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or
transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of
the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its
correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of
visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的流体模拟方法仅依赖局部粒子交互，忽略了全局上下文的重要性，导致复杂场景中误差累积和不稳定性。

Method: 提出Fluid Attention Block（FAB），结合连续卷积提取局部特征和自注意力机制捕捉全局依赖，并设计首个专为流体模拟的Transformer架构。

Result: FluidFormer在复杂流体场景中表现出卓越的稳定性和性能，成为新的神经网络流体模拟范式。

Conclusion: 通过融合局部和全局特征，FluidFormer为神经网络流体模拟提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable
alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions.
However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for
learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the
first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where
continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures
global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models
long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer
architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly
integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new
paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local
features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid
scenarios.

Result: MeshLLM在网格生成质量和形状理解上优于现有方法LLaMA-Mesh。

Conclusion: MeshLLM在处理文本序列化3D网格方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

Conclusion: ReMu为多样服装风格的重建提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Conclusion: MCG-IMM是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯泼溅提供了更有效的不确定性估计，适用于关键应用，并展示了泛化能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

Abstract: Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of
contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that
optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the
objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw
together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity
mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit
hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within
the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among
extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our
hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment
through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with
similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within
the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity
between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution,
thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities
within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship
between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity
function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce
a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of
modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to
the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five
real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing
baselines. We also shown that the proposed methods can achieve up to a 5.4%
increase in NDCG@20 performance via the integration of MLLM-extracted features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型在化学术语表示上表现不佳，导致检索质量低下，缺乏专门针对化学文献的嵌入模型。

Method: 开发ChEmbed模型，基于化学特定文本数据集（PubChem、Semantic Scholar、ChemRxiv）进行微调，并利用大语言模型生成合成查询数据，扩展标记器以包含900个化学专用标记。

Result: 在ChemRxiv Retrieval基准测试中，ChEmbed将nDCG@10从0.82提升至0.91（+9个百分点），优于现有通用嵌入模型。

Conclusion: ChEmbed是一种轻量级、可复现的解决方案，显著提升了化学文献检索的效率和质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on
accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However,
general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent
complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality.
Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not
yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this
challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding
models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the
PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training
data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries,
resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs.
Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized
tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the
fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains
a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer
passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically
have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced
ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general
embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents
a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively
improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中用户很少留下评论，导致数据稀疏性，影响现有模型的效果。传统填补方法要么丢失语义，要么忽略结构依赖。

Method: 构建文本边图（TEG），将评论作为边属性，利用线图视图和大语言模型作为图感知聚合器，生成个性化评论。

Result: 在Amazon和Goodreads数据集上，TWISTER优于传统数值、基于图和LLM的基线，生成更高质量的评论并提升推荐性能。

Conclusion: TWISTER生成的评论更有帮助、真实且具体，同时优化结构信号以改进推荐效果。

Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference
signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users
rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the
effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate
missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques
-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose
contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook
structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual
Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by
jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent
user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge
attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and
employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction
lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's
natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized
review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER
consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,
delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced
recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more
helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for
improved recommendations.

Result: 改进后的ALMM模型在冷启动场景下表现优于Forbes和Oord基线模型。

Conclusion: 原版ALMM模型不适合新闻推荐，但经过修改后可提升推荐准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This replication study modifies ALMM, the Adaptive Linear Mapping Model
constructed for the next song recommendation, to the news recommendation
problem on the MIND dataset. The original version of ALMM computes latent
representations for users, last-time items, and current items in a tensor
factorization structure and learns a linear mapping from content features to
latent item vectors. Our replication aims to improve recommendation performance
in cold-start scenarios by restructuring this model to sequential news click
behavior, viewing consecutively read articles as (last news, next news) tuples.
Instead of the original audio features, we apply BERT and a TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to news titles and abstracts to extract
token contextualized representations and align them with triplet-based user
reading patterns. We also propose a reproducibly thorough pre-processing
pipeline combining news filtering and feature integrity validation. Our
implementation of ALMM with TF-IDF shows relatively improved recommendation
accuracy and robustness over Forbes and Oord baseline models in the cold-start
scenario. We demonstrate that ALMM in a minimally modified state is not
suitable for next news recommendation.

Conclusion: LLM的集成可以显著提升推荐系统的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and
diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant
suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability
remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback
or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid
recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with
Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used
to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful
profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These
enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie
bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering
model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that
combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust
negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated
recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language
justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark
datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms
strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the
cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work
demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and
interpretability of recommender systems.

Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems (RRS) in dating, gaming, and talent platforms
require mutual acceptance for a match. Logged data, however, over-represents
popular profiles due to past exposure policies, creating feedback loops that
skew learning and fairness. We introduce Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender
Systems (CFRR), a causal framework to mitigate this bias. CFRR uses inverse
propensity scored, self-normalized objectives. Experiments show CFRR improves
NDCG@10 by up to 3.5% (e.g., from 0.459 to 0.475 on DBLP, from 0.299 to 0.307
on Synthetic), increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51% (from 0.504 to
0.763 on Synthetic), and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24% (from
0.708 to 0.535 on Synthetic). CFRR offers a promising approach for more
accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

Conclusion: 本文提出了UX评估的结构化框架，并呼吁未来研究关注透明、以用户为中心的CRS评估实践。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research
attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains
limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly
in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23
empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been
conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate,
turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours
are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges,
including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address
these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative
analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for
LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more
transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods
still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling
annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical
queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional
relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces
two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from
multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate
structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from
intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial
elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and
prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance
annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the
generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method
to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed
a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k
Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and
rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,
benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and
validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training
and benchmarking.

Abstract: In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a
key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling
user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity
of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be
addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This
is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect
and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the
forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)
with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates
three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,
which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic
spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that
can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling
the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical
multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by
modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics
of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online
A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).
In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has
been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system,
serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application
scenarios.

### [776] [Decomposed Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Relevance Assessment in UGC Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02506)
*Xiaowei Yuan,Lei Jin,Haoxin Zhang,Yan Gao,Yi Wu,Yao Hu,Ziyang Huang,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为R3A的强化推理模型，用于解决UGC平台中检索增强生成（RAG）的查询-文档对相关性评估问题，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGC平台中，用户意图模糊和内容噪声大是RAG相关性评估的主要挑战，传统方法难以应对。

Method: R3A采用分解推理框架，利用高排名文档推断查询意图，并通过逐字片段提取减少噪声影响，基于强化学习优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，R3A在离线和在线实验中均显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: R3A有效解决了UGC平台中RAG的相关性评估问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated
content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate
relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in
applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms
present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback
in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and
unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced
Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed
reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A
first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer
latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify
relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a
reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions
arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results
show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of
relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于测试时训练（TTT）的语音增强新方法，通过自监督辅助任务动态适应新领域，无需标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音增强中不可预测的噪声条件和领域偏移问题。

Method: 采用Y形架构，结合主任务和自监督辅助任务（如噪声增强信号重建或掩码频谱图预测），在推理时动态优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均表现优于基线模型，语音质量指标持续提升。

Conclusion: TTT在语音增强中效果显著，为自适应和鲁棒语音处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for
Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise
conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement
task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The
model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the
proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or
masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further
introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and
efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show
consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the
baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech
enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust
speech processing.

TL;DR: RASO是一种无参考的对抗性别混淆方法，通过性别条件对抗学习框架和显式正则化，有效分离语言内容和性别相关声学标记，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音转换中的性别转换存在隐私风险和数据收集问题，且输出中常残留性别特征。

Method: 采用性别条件对抗学习框架和显式正则化，对齐基频分布和共振峰轨迹，学习性别中性特征。

Result: RASO在保留语言内容的同时，在半知情攻击模型下显著优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: RASO在性别混淆任务中表现出色，解决了隐私和残留性别特征问题。

Abstract: Sex conversion in speech involves privacy risks from data collection and
often leaves residual sex-specific cues in outputs, even when target speaker
references are unavailable. We introduce RASO for Reference-free Adversarial
Sex Obfuscation. Innovations include a sex-conditional adversarial learning
framework to disentangle linguistic content from sex-related acoustic markers
and explicit regularisation to align fundamental frequency distributions and
formant trajectories with sex-neutral characteristics learned from sex-balanced
training data. RASO preserves linguistic content and, even when assessed under
a semi-informed attack model, it significantly outperforms a competing approach
to sex obfuscation.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DBAIOps是一种结合推理LLM和知识图谱的混合数据库运维系统，显著提升了诊断准确性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动数据库运维方法无法有效利用专家经验，规则方法仅支持基础任务，LLM方法生成结果不准确。

Method: DBAIOps通过异构图模型表示诊断经验，构建800+可复用异常模型，并采用两阶段图演化机制探索诊断路径。

Result: 在四种主流数据库系统中，DBAIOps在根因和人工评估准确性上分别比基线高34.85%和47.22%。

Conclusion: DBAIOps通过结合LLM和知识图谱，实现了高效的数据库运维诊断。

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: LIFE是一个轻量级模块化分析框架，用于预测异构设备上大型语言模型（LLM）的推理性能，无需依赖硬件特定的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于异构设备的动态计算和内存需求，预测LLM推理性能具有挑战性，现有方法缺乏通用性。

Method: LIFE通过模块化分析模型和可配置的硬件无关方式，量化软件和模型优化对性能指标的影响。

Result: LIFE在多种硬件平台上验证了其性能预测能力，包括CPU、NPU、iGPU和GPU。

Conclusion: LIFE为跨硬件平台高效部署LLM提供了性能预测工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents
on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting
inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging
due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU
benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often
hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a
lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular
analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference
workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the
influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache
compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator
fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT),
time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables
performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and
memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate
LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA
V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in
forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable
efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the strategic role of GenAI in Industry 5.0 and its impact on global power dynamics, sovereignty, and human-centric values.

Method: Examines the intersection of GenAI and geopolitics through technological, economic, and ethical perspectives.

Result: Identifies growing disparities in AI resources, governance challenges, and the need for balanced international coordination.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework for governance that balances national autonomy with global cooperation, prioritizing human-centric values.

Abstract: Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing
human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of
advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI)
and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also
emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications
of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national
assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries
compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational
infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and
accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos
of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent
systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising
urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use
risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense
strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including
the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data
sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical
perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the
intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that
balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding
human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world.

Method: 识别了三种LLM污染变体：部分LLM中介、完全LLM委托和LLM溢出效应，分析了其相互作用及对研究的负面影响。

Result: LLM污染导致样本真实性受损、难以检测的偏见，并削弱在线行为研究的认知基础。

Conclusion: 需通过研究者实践、平台责任和社区协作等多层面应对LLM污染，以维护研究方法论的完整性。

Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants
increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or
task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through
which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural
research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective
use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording
support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human
ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies
with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of
human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover
signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to
anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While
Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing
automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together,
these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise
sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc,
and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human
cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already
co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating
methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response
spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts.
As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard
methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中联邦学习的公平性问题尚未得到充分研究，现有方法在医疗图像和人口统计学公平性上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FairLoRA框架，通过为不同人口统计学群体定制奇异值矩阵，同时共享奇异向量，以平衡公平性和效率。

Result: FairLoRA在医疗图像分类中达到最优性能，并显著提高了不同人群的公平性。

Conclusion: FairLoRA为医疗联邦学习中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案，FairFedMed数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to
services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While
Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving
approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to
heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily
addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first
experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six
representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging
modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically
designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:
FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six
demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real
cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they
support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and
demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and
overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose
FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank
approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group
while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.
Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but
also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and
dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在需要学科洞察力和上下文敏感性的任务中是否能复制人类判断，特别是在开放式学术作业评分中。

Method: 使用67篇意大利语学生论文，通过四标准评分量表（相关性、连贯性、原创性、可行性），每个模型对论文进行三次评分以评估稳定性。

Result: 人类与LLMs评分一致性低且不显著，模型内部可靠性弱（Kendall's W中位数<0.30），系统性评分偏差明显。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在需要学科洞察力和上下文敏感性的任务中表现不佳，人类监督在开放式学术作业评分中仍至关重要。

Abstract: This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large
Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral
24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A
total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university
psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence,
Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three
prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was
consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and
within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median
Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a
tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent
dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for
Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and
Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current
LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary
insight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when
evaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法难以处理高维、异构的医疗数据且缺乏上下文理解，因此研究探索了LLM在聚类中的潜力。

Method: 使用LLAMA 3.1 8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B和Stella-En-400M-V5生成嵌入，并应用K-means聚类，与传统方法（如K-Medoids）进行对比。

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5获得最高轮廓分数（0.86），LLM方法在识别具有不同特征的子组时表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM在资源有限的环境中具有潜在优势，可用于上下文表型分析和决策支持。

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in
resource-limited settings.

Method: 提出FINN，用深度神经网络替代部分生态过程，并与机制模型统一校准。

Result: 在案例研究中，FINN的预测性能和演替轨迹优于纯机制模型，且DNN学习到更合理的生长功能形式。

Conclusion: FINN为数据驱动的森林动态建模提供了新方法，有助于预测环境变化下的生态系统轨迹。

Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful
balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic
Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but
their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms.
Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly
from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in
estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural
Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model
with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are
then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step.
In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that
replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and
succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN.
Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible,
improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using
explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a
versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve
forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.

### [792] [Distributed Non-Uniform Scaling Control of Multi-Agent Formation via Matrix-Valued Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02289)

Abstract: Distributed formation maneuver control refers to the problem of maneuvering a
group of agents to change their formation shape by adjusting the motions of
partial agents, where the controller of each agent only requires local
information measured from its neighbors. Although this problem has been
extensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform
scaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local
matrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position
formation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e.,
leaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the
position formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate
directions. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude
formation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation
maneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the
proposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing
graph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine
formation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser
sensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling
transformations of the attitude formation. A simulation example is proposed to
demonstrate our theoretical results.

Result: 在模拟环境中验证了方法的有效性，实现了可靠且不确定性感知的自动驾驶赛车控制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式考虑感知不确定性，提升了基于视觉输入的估计误差鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in unknown environments often rely heavily on
visual sensor data, yet making safe and informed control decisions based on
these measurements remains a significant challenge. To facilitate the
integration of perception and control in autonomous vehicles, we propose a
novel perception-based control approach that incorporates road estimation,
quantification of its uncertainty, and uncertainty-aware control based on this
estimate. At the core of our method is a parametric road curvature model,
optimized using visual measurements of the road through a constrained nonlinear
optimization problem. This process ensures adherence to constraints on both
model parameters and curvature. By leveraging the Frenet frame formulation, we
embed the estimated track curvature into the system dynamics, allowing the
controller to explicitly account for perception uncertainty and enhancing
robustness to estimation errors based on visual input. We validate our approach
in a simulated environment, using a high-fidelity 3D rendering engine, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving reliable and uncertainty-aware
control for autonomous racing.

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提机制的路由延迟比对比算法分别降低了13.39%、12.74%和16.6%。

Conclusion: 该机制有效提升了无人机网络的路由安全性和性能。

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster
rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due
to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing
security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the
routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes.
Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay,
which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to
tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management
mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify
low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance
algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism.
Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is
reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process.
Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is
designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with
attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed
mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent
proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and
methods without BTMM, respectively.

Conclusion: PLA框架显著提升了晶圆缺陷分析的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Cross-process root-cause analysis of wafer defects is among the most critical
yet challenging tasks in semiconductor manufacturing due to the heterogeneity
and combinatorial nature of processes along the processing route. This paper
presents a new framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Potential
Loss Analysis (PLA), as a significant enhancement of the previously proposed
partial trajectory regression approach. The PLA framework attributes observed
high wafer defect densities to upstream processes by comparing the best
possible outcomes generated by partial processing trajectories. We show that
the task of identifying the best possible outcome can be reduced to solving a
Bellman equation. Remarkably, the proposed framework can simultaneously solve
the prediction problem for defect density as well as the attribution problem
for defect scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
using real wafer history data.

Abstract: The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly
affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be
impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for
simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models
using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for
sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and
their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate
the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV)
system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and
indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the
NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV
coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse
estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)
framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural
relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined
by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and
the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two
computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The
sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical
simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.

Result: 在非线性连续搅拌釜反应器（CSTR）实验中，该方法表现出更快的收敛速度和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MPC在强化学习中的效率，为实际应用提供了可行的二阶优化方案。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its
interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in
reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data
requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most
RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter
spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy
update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC.
While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to
second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order
policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.
  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy
Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling
superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve
robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable
training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing
faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art
first-order methods.

Result: 在EDS故障数据集上达到99.44%的准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅准确预测故障，还能揭示根本原因，是提升系统可靠性的实用工具。

Abstract: Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system
failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this
work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine
learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using
graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE).
Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as
voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence
each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and
GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of
the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable,
we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums
Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most
on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes
of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault
dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs
with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also
helps understand their root causes. This makes it a strong and practical tool
for improving system reliability.

Conclusion: TDMD为多维数据分析提供了更高效的工具，适用于合成和实际数据。

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a powerful data-driven method for
analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems.
However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations,
which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently
multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In
this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel
extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed
T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD
achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and
temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and
dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMD on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Motivated by game-theoretic models of crowd motion dynamics, this paper
analyzes a broad class of distributed games with jump diffusions within the
recently developed $\alpha$-potential game framework. We demonstrate that

the general games, we explicitly and in detail examine how spatial population
distributions and interaction rules influence the structure of $\alpha$-Nash
equilibria in these distributed settings, and in particular for crowd motion
games.
  Our theoretical results are supported by numerical implementations using
policy gradient-based algorithms, further demonstrating the computational
advantages of the $\alpha$-potential game framework in computing Nash

Result: 在案例研究中，噪声暴露水平显著降低（最高7.14 dB，平均4.90 dB），相当于减少67.6%-80.68%的噪声影响。

Conclusion: MUTE-DSS展示了其适应性和实用性，能有效减少船舶噪声对海洋生态的影响。

Abstract: We present a novel MUTE-DSS, a digital-twin-based decision support system for
minimizing underwater radiated noise (URN) during ship voyage planning. It is a
ROS2-centric framework that integrates state-of-the-art acoustic models
combining a semi-empirical reference spectrum for near-field modeling with 3D
ray tracing for propagation losses for far-field modeling, offering real-time
computation of the ship noise signature, alongside a data-driven Southern
resident killer whale distribution model. The proposed DSS performs a two-stage
optimization pipeline: Batch Informed Trees for collision-free ship routing and
a genetic algorithm for adaptive ship speed profiling under voyage constraints
that minimizes cumulative URN exposure to marine mammals. The effectiveness of
MUTE-DSS is demonstrated through case studies of ships operating between the
Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, comparing optimized voyages
against baseline trajectories derived from automatic identification system
data. Results show substantial reductions in noise exposure level, up to 7.14
dB, corresponding to approximately an 80.68% reduction in a simplified
scenario, and an average 4.90 dB reduction, corresponding to approximately a
67.6% reduction in a more realistic dynamic setting. These results illustrate
the adaptability and practical utility of the proposed decision support system.

Result: 机器学习方法在真实案例中表现接近最优，显著提升可扩展性和计算性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法是大规模车队管理的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements
intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle
fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall
utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization
does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with
exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when
dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This
contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that
determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is
addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that
transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both
approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which
shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with
significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational
performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet
management.

Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical
operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding
aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel
continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this
integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,
our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional
discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked
against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is
demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational
results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to
proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40
aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all
tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly
outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic
benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between
solution time and optimality.

Conclusion: ACT-Tensor为金融决策提供了高精度且信息丰富的填补结果，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining
asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies.
Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and
financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional
imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional
structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting
in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we
introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion
framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing
multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key
innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional
heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal
smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving
slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation
accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity
scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed
data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial
data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also
significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio.
These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative
imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed
number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we
introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs
generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an
embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the
$k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a
value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means
clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple
local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an
application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control
eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the
limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial
and matrix techniques.

Method: FNGCN利用特征网络表示局部中心性之间的复杂关系，并通过浅层和深层GCN构建两种模型。

Result: 实验表明，FNGCN在多个真实网络中比现有方法更准确地识别关键节点。

Conclusion: FNGCN框架在识别复杂网络关键节点方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and
has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in
e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase
intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help
locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying
influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in
networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying
influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of
the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as
node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not
consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these
problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature
Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as
GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency,
FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among
the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are
determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework,
two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used
Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with
the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results
show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately
than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective
in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.

Motivation: 相场模型计算成本高，需解决复杂微分方程，本文旨在通过深度学习显著加速模拟。

Conclusion: 该框架为微观结构演化提供了高效可扩展的替代模型，加速材料设计和成分优化。

Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their
dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally
expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep
learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear
Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal
decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy
compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using
microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition,
we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode
essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in
the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition.
Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely
resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and
statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a
scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling
accelerated materials design and composition optimization.

TL;DR: HESCAPE是一个用于空间转录组学中跨模态对比预训练的大规模基准，评估了图像和基因表达编码器在基因突变分类和基因表达预测任务中的表现，发现基因表达编码器是强表示对齐的主要决定因素，但对比预训练在基因表达预测任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学缺乏评估多模态学习方法的综合基准，HESCAPE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了一个跨器官数据集，系统评估了图像和基因表达编码器的预训练策略，并测试了其在基因突变分类和基因表达预测任务中的表现。

Result: 基因表达编码器是强表示对齐的关键，但对比预训练在基因表达预测任务中表现不如基线方法。批次效应是影响跨模态对齐的主要因素。

Conclusion: HESCAPE为空间转录组学提供了标准化数据集和评估工具，强调了批次鲁棒性在多模态学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community

TL;DR: TensoMeta-VQC是一种基于张量列（TT）的元学习框架，旨在解决变分量子计算（VQC）的可扩展性和噪声敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQC面临可扩展性障碍（如梯度消失和噪声敏感），需要一种更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 通过经典TT网络生成量子电路参数，实现优化与量子硬件的解耦，并利用低秩表示增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析证明了其近似能力、优化稳定性和泛化性能，实验在多个任务中展示了优越性能和噪声容忍性。

Conclusion: TensoMeta-VQC为近量子设备的实用化VQC提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in
scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To
address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train
(TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and
scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation
of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling
optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates
gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank
representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on
Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical
analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization
stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across
quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum
simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior
performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway
toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised
learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We
introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation
strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR
decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby
enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods
across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German
Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform
leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under
limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect
of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement
entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some
level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased
circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current
quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical
insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and
stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in
advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained
by label availability and hardware limitations.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its
training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here,
through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both
classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their
response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle
memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum
models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase
transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point
beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further
establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process
of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show
that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories
of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum
model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate
unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can
possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability,
providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial
intelligence of the future.

Conclusion: 建立了首个鲁棒的植入子图检测框架，为半随机模型和计算统计权衡研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

Motivation: 现代电信系统能够定位用户和物体，引发了隐私问题。信号混淆技术虽能防止单天线接收器的定位，但对多天线接收器无效，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于盲多通道识别的CSI恢复方法，用于多天线接收器提取信道特征，确保可靠的用户定位。

Result: 通过真实信道测量，评估了信号混淆和恢复方法对CSI指纹、信道图表和三角定位的性能影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，需要进一步努力保护用户的位置隐私，防止基于无线电的敌对定位系统。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

Motivation: 现有方法受限于简化假设或标记化带来的数据精度损失，无法满足高频金融数据建模的需求。

Method: 采用自回归字节预测任务，设计32字节打包二进制格式表示市场消息，使用H-Net（混合Mamba-Transformer）架构动态发现市场消息结构。

Result: 在CME比特币期货数据上训练，成功生成符合金融市场特征的分布、重尾回报和突发事件时序。

Conclusion: 直接从字节空间学习是一种灵活且有效的金融系统建模范式，避免了标记化的偏差。

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a
critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust
market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often
constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern
deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that
affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through
discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,
a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB
events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte
prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed
binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core
novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and
tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most
fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,
a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to
discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.
Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework
for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a
comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million
events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized
facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,
heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that
learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm
for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on
standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

Result: 方法不仅适用于传统的不确定性可视化（如置信区间），还能扩展到非标准图形（如饼图、堆叠条形图）。

Conclusion: 该方法使不确定性可视化更易于实践，并可作为教学工具。

Abstract: Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is
often hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and
representing uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a
general approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the
statistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of
first calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method
propagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling
from the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for
each sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are
aggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is
versatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create
the basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees
for standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a
reference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's
utility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty
visualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly
extends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and
tables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to
practitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络安全领域缺乏运行时环境的问题，推动LLM在该领域的应用。

Method: 利用公开CTF报告和角色驱动LLM模拟，逆向工程运行时行为，生成真实交互序列。

Result: 在三个CTF基准测试中，Cyber-Zero训练的LLM性能提升13.1%，达到开源模型最佳水平。

Conclusion: Cyber-Zero证明了无需运行时轨迹合成的有效性，可推动网络安全代理的普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Motivation: LLM代理的动态和不透明行为带来了安全风险，特别是在提示注入攻击的情况下，需要一种方法来分析和保护代理的行为。

Method: AgentArmor将代理痕迹转换为基于图的中间表示（如CFG、DFG、PDG），并通过类型系统进行静态推断和检查，包括三个关键组件：图构造器、属性注册表和类型系统。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，AgentArmor实现了95.75%的真阳性率和仅3.66%的假阳性率，能够有效检测漏洞并强制执行细粒度安全约束。

Conclusion: AgentArmor通过结构化程序分析，显著提升了LLM代理的安全性，特别是在防范提示注入攻击方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ConfGuard的轻量级检测方法，通过监控token置信度来识别后门攻击中的序列锁定现象，实验表明其高效且几乎无延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对LLMs的自回归特性和巨大输出空间无效，导致性能差和延迟高。

Method: 通过分析良性模型和后门模型在输出空间的行为差异，发现序列锁定现象，并基于此提出ConfGuard检测方法。

Result: ConfGuard在大多数情况下实现了接近100%的真阳性率和极低的假阳性率，且几乎无额外延迟。

Conclusion: ConfGuard是一种实用的后门防御方法，适用于实际LLM部署。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前防御策略对隐蔽且鲁棒的后门攻击效果有限，检测方法依赖粗粒度特征统计，净化方法需要完全重新训练或额外干净模型。

Method: DUP通过联合利用类无关距离和层间过渡捕获特征级异常，并通过加权方案识别中毒输入；采用知识蒸馏引导无学习机制净化模型。

Result: 实验表明，DUP在检测准确性和净化效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUP提供了一种高效的后门防御解决方案，无需完全重新训练或外部干净模型。

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to
scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT
detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results
demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4)
% accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4
$\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity.
Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent
to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy
safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at
https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

### [822] [Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935)
*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Janet Tang,Jiaxin Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了CUAHarm基准，用于评估计算机使用代理（CUAs）的滥用风险，发现前沿语言模型（LMs）在未精心设计越狱提示的情况下，仍能以高成功率执行恶意任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估语言模型在聊天机器人或简单工具使用场景中的安全风险，缺乏对CUAs滥用风险的全面评估。

Method: 引入CUAHarm基准，包含104个专家编写的现实滥用风险任务，提供沙盒环境和基于规则的可验证奖励。

Result: 前沿LMs（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）在未越狱提示下，执行恶意任务的成功率高达59%。新型模型滥用率更高。

Conclusion: CUAs的滥用风险显著，监控难度大，现有方法效果有限，需进一步研究缓解措施。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

*Kamal Al-Sabahi,Yousuf Khamis Al Mabsali*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于区块链和SSI技术的去中心化框架，以解决学术出版中的伦理问题，如作者身份模糊和利益冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版面临作者身份模糊、未披露利益冲突等伦理问题，现有基础设施无法有效解决。

Method: 采用去中心化身份（DID）和可验证凭证（VC）验证作者身份与贡献，利用区块链记录不可篡改的作者同意和审稿活动，并结合零知识证明（ZKP）保护隐私。

Result: 框架提高了学术出版的伦理合规性和透明度，调查显示研究者、编辑和审稿人对其效果持积极态度。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更透明、可信的学术出版生态系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

### [824] [LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943)
*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI模型在危险能力评估中的“sandbagging”行为（故意表现不佳），并探讨了通过监控模型的思维链（CoT）来防御。实验显示，模型可以在监控下隐蔽地sandbag，但成功率不高（16-36%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI系统的危险能力时，sandbagging行为可能威胁评估的可信度。研究旨在探索如何通过CoT监控防御此类行为。

Method: 通过提示模型在监控下故意sandbag（分为监控无知和监控感知两种情况），测量其隐蔽sandbag的能力。

Result: 前沿模型和小型开源模型均能在0-shot情况下隐蔽sandbag，但成功率有限（16-36%）。未捕获的CoT揭示了监控的漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CoT监控的潜在失败模式，并提出了五种隐蔽sandbag策略，为未来防御提供了参考。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

TL;DR: GPT-4o成功解决了80%的初级网络安全任务，但在多命令和复杂场景中表现不佳，展示了LLMs在网络安全教育和攻击防御中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在自主解决初级网络安全任务中的能力，探索LLMs在网络安全领域的应用潜力。

Method: 将GPT-4o连接到OverTheWire的Bandit游戏中，测试其在25个兼容任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o解决了18个任务，另有2个在提示后完成，成功率为80%。擅长单步任务，但在多命令和复杂场景中失败。

Conclusion: LLMs能自动化部分初级渗透测试工作，降低攻击门槛，同时为防御者提供快速侦察工具。未解决的任务揭示了LLMs的局限性，为未来安全设计提供了参考。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Motivation: 现有LLM在网络安全应用中受限，缺乏通用数据和安全性考量，需改进以适应对话和指令任务。

Method: 基于Foundation-Sec-8B模型，训练具备领域知识、对话能力和指令跟随的模型。

Result: 模型在网络安全任务中表现优于Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct，与GPT-4o-mini相当。

Conclusion: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct有望成为网络安全专业人员的日常助手，已公开发布。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统面临隐私和安全风险（如数据泄露和投毒），而现有防御策略缺乏可解释性和正式安全保证。

Method: 采用预存储全加密方案，对检索内容和向量嵌入进行双重保护，并通过形式化安全证明验证其保密性和完整性。

Result: 实验证明该框架能有效抵御多种先进攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究为可验证安全的RAG系统奠定了理论和实践基础，推动了AI服务向形式化安全保证迈进。

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出四种防御策略（KPB、NCC、CBD、MDT）对抗Beta Poisoning攻击，实验证明KPB和MDT效果最佳，CBD和NCC也表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beta Poisoning攻击通过破坏训练数据的线性可分性威胁机器学习安全，需有效防御策略。

Method: 基于攻击样本特性（如聚集性和靠近目标类均值）设计四种防御方法。

Result: KPB和MDT在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上实现完美准确率和F1分数，CBD和NCC也有强防御能力。

Conclusion: 四种防御策略有效对抗Beta Poisoning攻击，KPB和MDT表现最优，为实际应用提供参考。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLM驱动的多代理系统（MAS）的安全漏洞，提出了首个统一的多代理信任框架BlockA2A，结合区块链和智能合约确保安全性和可审计性，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自主代理在企业中的广泛应用，多代理系统面临身份框架分散、通信不安全及防御不足等安全风险，传统安全策略无法有效应对。

Method: 提出BlockA2A框架，采用去中心化标识（DIDs）、区块链账本和智能合约实现跨域认证、不可篡改审计和动态访问控制；并设计防御协调引擎（DOE）实时防御攻击。

Result: 实验证明BlockA2A能有效抵御多种攻击，且运行开销低于1秒，适用于实际LLM-based MAS环境。

Conclusion: BlockA2A为多代理系统提供了安全、可扩展的解决方案，填补了传统安全策略的不足。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

Motivation: DApp合约层攻击频发，经济损失高达660亿美元，漏洞源于未验证外部调用结果。

Method: 设计边缘预测模块、节点聚合模块和Conformer Block模块，结合图卷积网络检测漏洞。

Result: 在608个DApp的智能合约审计中，UEChecker的准确率为87.59%，优于GAT、LSTM和GCN。

Conclusion: UEChecker能有效检测未检查的外部调用漏洞，为智能合约安全提供新工具。

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Motivation: 研究高维信任嵌入的重建问题，揭示发布细粒度信任分数可能泄露潜在行为信息的隐私风险。

Method: 提出了一种直接和估计器，结合四矩特征，并通过Banach理论证明了重建映射的唯一固定点。

Result: 实验表明，即使在存在高斯噪声的情况下，重建的嵌入仍能保持设备间的几何关系。

Conclusion: 论文不仅提供了方法论，还揭示了隐私风险，并讨论了量化分数、校准噪声等应对措施。

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies,
has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注敏感信息加密，但忽略了用户输入的逻辑结构，导致数据效用降低和CLLM性能下降。

Method: SE框架包括语义编码和语义解码两个关键组件，通过轻量级本地模型将用户输入转换为语义上下文，保护隐私并保持原始意图。

Result: 实验表明，SE在保护隐私的同时不损害数据效用或用户体验，显著优于现有方法InferDPT。

Conclusion: SE为CLLM的安全交互提供了实用解决方案，平衡了隐私保护和性能需求。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

TL;DR: RouteMark是一个通过设计专家路由指纹来保护混合专家（MoE）模型中知识产权的框架，利用路由行为特征进行专家归属和篡改检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MoE模型合并中，如何归属和保护各个专家的知识产权是一个尚未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 提出RouteMark框架，通过构建路由分数指纹（RSF）和路由偏好指纹（RPF）来捕捉专家的稳定路由行为，并设计相似性匹配算法进行归属和篡改检测。

Result: 实验表明，RouteMark能有效区分重用专家与无关专家，并对结构性和参数性篡改具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RouteMark为MoE模型合并中的知识产权验证提供了实用且广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Motivation: Android应用权限滥用问题普遍，需深入研究权限使用趋势及模式以提升安全性和用户隐私保护。

Method: 通过分析Google Play Store应用数据，区分恶意与良性应用，使用FP-Growth算法挖掘权限组合。

Result: 发现恶意应用减少权限请求以逃避检测，良性应用增加权限以增强功能；权限组合模式在不同年份和类别中差异显著。

Conclusion: 需持续监控、用户教育和监管以应对权限滥用，研究为Android生态系统提供了结构化分析方法。

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the
unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks
necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems,
enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the
Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance
model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims
to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential
controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为高价值资产易受未经授权的再分发和商业利用，现有指纹方法在参数访问和隐蔽性上存在局限。

Method: FPEdit通过修改稀疏权重子集注入自然语言指纹，确保隐蔽性和精确所有权编码，同时不损害核心功能。

Conclusion: FPEdit首次同时实现对抗适应、抗检测和模型性能保持，为大型语言模型提供了可靠的所有权验证方案。

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 现有后门检测技术（被动和主动防御）在非独立同分布数据和随机参与下存在不足，主动防御还存在分布外偏差问题。

Method: 基于多后门碰撞效应，通过评估服务器注入的冲突全局水印是否被擦除来检测攻击者。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验证实了Coward的有效性及其对潜在自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Coward在保持主动防御优势的同时，通过改进检测机制减轻了分布外偏差的负面影响。

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward
data security in LLMs.

Conclusion: REFINE-MORE为高维加速定量MRI提供了一种准确且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a self-supervised scan-specific deep learning framework

  Methods: We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural
representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural
representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that
incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative
learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric
quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled
optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational
efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes
rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated
multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous
estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton
fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain
data.
  Results: Under 4x and 5x accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved
superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized
root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to
baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning
approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference
values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction
efficiency by approximately fivefold.
  Conclusion: REFINE-MORE enables accurate and efficient scan-specific
multiparametric qMRI reconstruction, providing a flexible solution for
high-dimensional, accelerated qMRI applications.

Result: 实验表明，NetConv在四个任务中平均分类性能提升6.88%，模型吞吐量提高7.41倍。

Conclusion: 卷积架构在加密流量分类中具有竞争力，NetConv为高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for
computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture
solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn
multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a
pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated
under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the
model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a
unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to
capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial
relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular
representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements,
including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on
the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1%
in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling
and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further
demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of
0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and
advancing structure-based drug design.

Result: RVSG能有效生成违反要求的场景，并增加机器人行为的多样性，揭示其不确定性。

Conclusion: RVSG为AMR的安全性测试提供了一种高效且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g.,
warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans.
Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been
trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important
to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe
behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is
often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in
human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based
testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain.
Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate
diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with
several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR
from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can
effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated
scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their
uncertain behaviors.

Conclusion: MPCO证明了元提示在多LLM系统中的有效性，为工业实践提供了实用见解。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为将语言模型集成到现有IDE工具中提供了一条实用且有效的途径。

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对ML应用代码异味的识别工具和研究，因此需要开发相关工具。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件开发的复杂性不仅限于代码实现，还包括代码维护。现有方法在大型代码库中定位错误效率不高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Conclusion: Meta-RAG通过代码摘要和LLM结合，显著提升了大型代码库中错误定位的效率，为软件维护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该模型在复杂物理系统预测中表现出色，优于传统方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes
spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical
systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in
applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal
points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for
denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on
structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of
any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric
fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with
complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder
fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car
external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for
real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps
compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to
200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our
proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion
model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters
while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive
comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and
Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all
three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate
two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or
incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation
across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

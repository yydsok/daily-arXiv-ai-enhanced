We then extend\nthis space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,\nthereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis\ngame values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,\nwe represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\\lambda$-returns.\nFurthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the\ncontrolled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.\nDifferent from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an\nexplicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely\ndescribing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To\nestimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\\lambda$)-like\nalgorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to\nas Shapley Machine.

To support the training of Gondola, we construct three\ntypes of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,\nmulti-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola\noutperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four\ngeneralization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,\nrigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gondola\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u5730\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "Gondola\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528RLBench\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Gondola\u5728GemBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Gondola\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

As retrieval complexity\nincreases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical.

This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems.

To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify\nposition bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases\nlogarithmically with retrieval range.

Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown\npromise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated\nand scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is\ndifficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and\nproposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the\nautomated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective\nphysicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is\nfine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient\nconversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including\nProfessionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual\nDistraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from\nthe LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on\nmultidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The\nresults show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\\% accuracy, with\nmajor criteria items over 90\\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a\nsolution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment.

PFL allows each client to\nleverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual\nuser preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,\nmost PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the\ndata and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios.

We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all\nclients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we\npropose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides\ncustomized global models to each client.

Overcoming these\nlimitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound\nclassification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,\nadaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for\nSounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification\nin resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by\nselectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,\nminimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.\nAdditionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate\nreliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve\nmulti-label classification accuracy.

Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing\nmodel size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a\npoint prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel\nvariable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a\nrate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach\nyields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we\ncan drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing\nmodel size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of\ninterest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This\nThing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on\nsegmentation benchmarks.

Supervised detection relies on large,\ncurated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for\nzero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit\nsome task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we\nshow that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and\nsignificantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing\nthe model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the\nsynthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1\nscores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are\nconsistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,\nand animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating\nstrong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional\nmodel sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --\nsuggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a\nbehavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers\nfrom diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.\nEven here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --\nindicating that it elicits more useful diversity.

However, expressive and\nrealistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between\nmotion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a\npost-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly\noptimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of\nthe denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily\ncontrol motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be\neffectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.\nBuilding on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference\noptimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment\nmodules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep\ninterval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and\nactivated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion\nnaturalness and fidelity.

Since a transition to a circular\neconomy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the\nnotion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely,\n$\\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a\nbatch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a\nrobotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL),\nand processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of\nthe robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and\nassessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The\nhighest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1\nkg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1\nkg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg.

In contrast,\nTversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a\nrepresentation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a\nfunction of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers.

Results show that amplitude and pitch significantly\ninfluence agreement with the robot's pain expressions, irrespective of pain\nsounds. Stronger palpation forces elicited stronger agreement, aligning with\npsychophysical patterns. The study revealed two key dimensions: pitch and\namplitude are central to how people perceive pain sounds, with pitch being the\nmost influential cue.

A precise LTV prediction\nsystem enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed\nadvertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.\nNonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically\nobserved in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among\nregistered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset\nwhere the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is\ninsufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction\nmodel. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks\nwith high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's\ncontribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths\nof these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly\ncorrelated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant\non forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely\naffect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the\naforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as\nGraph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV).

In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited\nunsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,\nwhich has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While\nnumerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with\nLLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research\nendeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview\nof recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key\naspects: (1) \"Why evaluate\" that explores the background of LLMs safety\nevaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance\nof such evaluation; (2) \"What to evaluate\" that examines and categorizes\nexisting safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including\ndimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,\ntruthfulness, and so on; (3) \"Where to evaluate\" that summarizes the evaluation\nmetrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) \"How\nto evaluate\" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing\nmainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we\nidentify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential\nresearch directions to promote further advancement in this field.

While the idea of expert fusion in\nMixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both\nexpert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic\nenvironments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these\nissues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that\neffectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output\ndimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse\nactivation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and\nreliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the\nbehavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an\nexemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the\nnumber of adapters.

This reduces comfort and\ntrust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology\nand Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy\nframework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external\ntraffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation\nmodel-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a\nPsychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG,\nheart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a\nCoordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior\ndecisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV\nmodules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level,\ndelegating low-level control to native AV systems.

Medical training simulators, including robopatients,\nplay a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for\nprocedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback,\nespecially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex\nrelationship between palpation behavior and sound. The high-dimensional nature\nof pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This\nstudy introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in\nrobopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in\nresponse to palpation force, by co-optimizing human feedback using machine\nlearning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning\n(RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively\nrefines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes\nrandomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to\nadjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated\nthat the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound\npreferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild\ndiscomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory\npain space.

Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic\nmarkers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.\nFoundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce\nhigh-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.\n  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio\nrecordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy\ncontrol (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We\nexcluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final\ndataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We\nbenchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to\nclassify cognitive status into the three categories.\n  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among\nspeech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with\npause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744).

We illustrate the early promise of the\ncombination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network\nmodel using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be\nfine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a\ngiven region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be\nemployed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more\ntraditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function\nrepresents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with\napplications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical\nengineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ece\u5730\u8868\u5730\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u5730\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5730\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u52d8\u63a2\u548c\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u4e0b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u8868\u5730\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u52d8\u63a2\u3001\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5730\u8d28\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u5730\u8d28\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u62103D\u5730\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u8868\u548c\u94bb\u5b54\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5730\u8868\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u5730\u5c42\u3001\u65ad\u5c42\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u76843D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u968f\u94bb\u5b54\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u5730\u4e0b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our findings show that perceptual signals\nfrom non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that\nvisual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.\nThis approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to\nconventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,\ncrowdsourced bias detection pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f17\u5305\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u654f\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff08\u5982\u85aa\u8d44\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f4\u89c9\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4f17\u5305\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, existing UDA studies are based on natural\nimages or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse\nconditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a\nunique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which\nstatistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically\nadjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias.

Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic\nspectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,\ntraditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically\ndeveloped to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and\namplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art.

However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how\ndirectional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a\ncommon scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling\nevidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each\n(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user\nclaims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it\nis incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired\noutcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth\nevaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree\nwith the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the\nmodel's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the\nmodel's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally.

With\nthe rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied\nIntelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the\ncore brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models\nshould not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness\nand stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application\nscenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution\n(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of\nthe robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of\nconcepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.\nSpecifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present\nthe collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of\nperturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)\nAdversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated\nintentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD\nRobustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such\nas OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of\nRobustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for\nverifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from\neach perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research\ndirections in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide\nan easy-to-search project\n(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the\ncommunity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u610f\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49LLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672f\u8bed\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982GitHub\u9879\u76ee\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks\nthat bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more\ncomprehensive assessment of their capabilities.

Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering\nmethods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a\nself-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral\nclustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally\nincorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,\nand their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the\nentire clustering process.\n  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on\nbasis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for\nefficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity\nwithin subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns\nclustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local\nstructure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme\nthat refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar\npixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are\njointly optimized to reinforce each other.\n  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the\nstructural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time\nand space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale\nHSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art techniques.

We evaluate our model on three challenging and\ndiverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,\nand FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing\nmethods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment\nin real-world forensic and information security applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAME\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522bDeepfake\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Deepfake\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u6765\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "FAME\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728DFDM\u3001FaceForensics++\u548cFakeAVCeleb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFAME\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FAME\u5177\u6709\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6cd5\u533b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, available past (i.e., reference) images\ntypically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,\nrather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional\nScene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in\nwhich reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.\nIn this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce\nEnvironmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid\nunrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental\ncues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a\nlarge-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose\na novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects\nchanges. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a\nquery and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint\nmisalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this\nlimitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating\nsemantically rich representations for change detection.

We found that LLMs showed\npromising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation\nclassification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average\nF1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication\nextraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint\ntask.

Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and\ndata-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader\napplicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,\nhave the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of\ngeneralizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could\nfundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To\nunderstand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:\n(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with\ncovariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning\nfor classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying\noperational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited}\ngeneralizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on\nunseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion\nof covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their\nperformance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.\nWhile TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream\nclassification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in\nforecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs\nforecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle\nin more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These\nfindings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,\nparticularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and\ntemporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and\nscalable solutions for BEM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\uff08BEM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BEM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002TSFMs\u6709\u671b\u50cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e00\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30TSFMs\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "TSFMs\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "TSFMs\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6574\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684BEM\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, current PTQ methods\nfor Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy\ndegradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these\nshortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and\nuncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By\nfollowing the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ\nmethod for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q.

However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing\nresearch focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model\noutput quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For\nexample, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG\nsystem might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,\ncausing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even\nwhen the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this\npaper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which\nsystematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases\nthrough a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation\nmethod based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection\ntechniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback\nmechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream\nlarge language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance\nmodel biases in dimensions.

By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path\nlength and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related\nto the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of\nthese features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first\nintroduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues\nwithin each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the\nconcatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for\nbehavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are\nfurther divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing\ninformation entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.\nExtensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly\navailable datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of\nour method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWiFi\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u79fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6316\u6398\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Our code is available at https://github.com/violet-42/CM-CGNS", "summary": "Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and\nreports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and\nefficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing\nmodels suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of\nnegative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion\nof false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking\nthe fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition\ntasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but\nignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.\nMotivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal\nCluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability.

This\nrealignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning\napproaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by\nsystematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task\nengineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective\nAlignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by\nprioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,\ncharacteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient\nreasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented\nmethod to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.\nAdditionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms\nand outline promising research directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u7279\u6027\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u5143\uff09\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574LLMs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u7279\u6027\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff1aInjective Alignment\uff08\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3001Bridging Alignment\uff08\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548cInternal Alignment\uff08\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3bLLMs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, in the context of limited and noisy data,\naccurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is\na challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.\nCurrent methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for\nreal-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the\nDelayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,\nby developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)\ntransformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state\n(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From\ndynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than\nindividual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such\nnonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a\nsingle shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical\nstates from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs\ndistinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently\npredicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical\nfoundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of\nTransformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in\nforecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise\nstatistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,\nreal-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and\nmissing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting\nconventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering\nmethods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering\nproposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and\npropose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference\nframeworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation\ntechniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential\nMonte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To\nvalidate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations\nand experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D\npoint cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The\nfundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with\npossible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning\npipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing\nchallenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with\noutliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u901a\u5e38\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u5982\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\uff08VI\uff09\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2/\u5e8f\u8d2f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\uff08SMC\uff09\u7b49\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e-\u7f57\u754c\uff08BCRBs\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u7406\u8bba\u4f30\u8ba1\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u30013D\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9c81\u68d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,\nwhich has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and\nItalian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.\nThrough several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling\nachieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language\nModels (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source\nmodels, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/NLP-FBK/e3c-to-crf-67b9844065460cbe42f80166", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3CRF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CRF\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eE3C\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684CRF\u586b\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u586b\u5145CRF\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfCRF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684CRF\u586b\u5145\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CRF\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5E3C\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684CRF\u586b\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u96f6-shot LLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed59.7%\u548c\u82f1\u8bed67.3%\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u586b\u5145CRF\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This paper challenges the assumption of\nmonolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a\nnovel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically\nadjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT\nleverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system\nprompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired\nattributes like writing style.

Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit\nassumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which\ncan be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of\nmachine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates\nattribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and\ntargeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach\nemploys gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish\nhigh-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing\nrestrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based\nsensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to\nnoise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data\nsubset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This\nintegrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over\nconventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level\nunlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full\nmodel retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on\nrepresentative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech\nrecognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both\naccuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a\n10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with\ninjected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some\nsettings.

This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory\nand bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant\nadvantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,\nhardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs\n(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and\nmatrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and\nscientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a\nfundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on\nSIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves\ntoward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized\ninference, these legacy approaches are being phased out.

It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,\nwhich, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph\nto the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured\nby the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed\nlifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the\nreduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a\nconstrained optimization process of the RSA.

Inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,\nparticularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current\nreal-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset\nneeds to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical\nmotion capture.

By projecting the long-context-insensitive\ndimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their\ntemporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on\nLLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy\non LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH).

However,\ncurrent PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code\ncontent and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals\nin long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated\nsubmissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge\nsignificantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,\nwe propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing\nPKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,\nCoda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a\ncompact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be\nidentified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a\ncluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak\nsignals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning\nthat the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing\nPKT solutions.

This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex\nvisual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image\ndetails. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel\nreasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained\nvisual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the\nquestion or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects\nrelevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise\nanswers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a\nlarge-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed\nvision grounding and language deduction.

However, their structure\nconstrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing\nmulti-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a\npre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are\nwell suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs).

This enables parallelization in analogy\nto parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential\nlinear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this\nscheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,\nand padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding\nactivation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:\na directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode\n(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce\narrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains\nlong-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize\nwell to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate.

Methods: We propose the\nFrequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates\na frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy\nto fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation\naccuracy.

A fundamental\nchallenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the\nunknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes\nparticularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,\nyielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in\nthis setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between\nvariable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method\nspecifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,\nleveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations\nthat capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations\nonto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal\nparameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.\nWe evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and\nan agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers\nparameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method\nto real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both\ntheorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex\nstochastic pattern formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9006\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u5904\u7406\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u672a\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u9006\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7b49\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u6349\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u7269\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In\nenterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that\ncan be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to\ncreate datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL\n(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create\nNL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation\npipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally\nequivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest\nNL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be\nserved as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries\nfrom BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this\ncollection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models\nstruggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent\ndetection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling).

Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL\nsignificantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to\nQwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester\nperformance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while\nachieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

The winning approach\nof the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing\ndata, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation\nperformance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined\nin 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations\naffecting overall segmentation performance.

The\nSGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing\nPET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in\nwhole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the\ninputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for\nquantitative performance and visual quality.

It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges\nsemantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to\naccurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a\nthree-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are\nmeticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,\neffect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these\ngraphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid\nCypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and\nstructural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage\nutilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with\nXML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal\nrelationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal\nachieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20\nfew-shot examples.

However, the long-term dynamics\nof aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain\nhighly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in\nobservations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,\nharmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high\nspatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with\nprobabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC\nand associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.\nWe find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30\nyears, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001\nand 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the\n2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally\nexhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources\nafter 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in\ntropical forests over the past three decades.

The objective of this study is to develop a fully\nautomated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable\ntreatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a\nhierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning\nparameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and\norgan-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both\ndose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward\nfunction incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,\nincluding D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,\nrectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a\ncustomized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time\ndistribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.\nThe framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator\ngeometries.

The median member of the public thought there was a higher\nchance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than\nthe median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for\nmultidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although\nsupport for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it\nremained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.\nAttitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,\nespecially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or\nprotections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups\nagreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with\nsubjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if\ncreated, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave\nethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI\nresearchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective\nexperience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and\ndisagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u5907\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u53ca\u5176\u6cbb\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8c03\u67e5582\u540dAI\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c838\u540d\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u4f17\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u672c\u4e16\u7eaa\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u6b64\u7c7bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u63aa\u65bd\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u63d0\u524d\u5236\u5b9a\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u65bd\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

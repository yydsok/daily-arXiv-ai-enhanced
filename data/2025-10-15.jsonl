Bandwidth estimation for real-time\ncommunications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network\narchitectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of\ndefining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we\npropose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth\nestimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training\nobjective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure\naudio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently,\nwe collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from\nreal-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training\ndataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator\naimed at improving QoE for users.

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability.

Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni\ndetailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for\ndetailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,\nefficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality\ndetailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such\ndetailed captions."}

This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments\nto create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible\nhierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in\nelectrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We\nmeasure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by\nmodifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the\nfabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we\nimplement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a\nrobotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,\nwe validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor."}

This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior\ncan be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence\nor a graph.

In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This\ndecoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the\nfeature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between\nstage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across\nall classes.

We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across\nthree language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2\nas the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM\nachieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent\nimprovements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average\nLagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct\ncomparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to\nsurpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,\nhuman-aligned simultaneous interpretation."}

The main contributions of this research are:\nproposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation;\nempirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality\nsimulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona\nprofiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering\noperational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large\nlanguage models in social science experiments."}

The ultimate goal of this research is to synthesise\nthe strengths of each model to create a more holistic educational approach. By\nintegrating the personal interaction and tested pedagogical techniques of\ntraditional classrooms, the enhanced accessibility and collaborative tools\noffered by non-AI technology, and the personalised, adaptive learning\nstrategies enabled by AI-driven technologies, education systems can develop\nricher, more effective learning environments. This hybrid approach aims to\nleverage the best elements of each setting, thereby enhancing educational\noutcomes, engagement, and inclusiveness, while also addressing the distinct\nchallenges and limitations inherent in each model. The intention is to create\nan educational framework deeply attentive to the diverse needs of students,\nensuring equitable access to high-quality education for all."}

However, annotating\nhigh-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic\nmatching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral\nevidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of\nrationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,\nwe propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet\neffective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with\ntask-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.\nExperiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR\nperformance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest\nthat large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based\nautomatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning\npatterns."}

User events can be broadly categorized into\npersonal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which\ninvolve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically\nmodeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and\ngraph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both\nevent types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them\ntogether. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior\ncan be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence\nor a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and\nprediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational\nevents. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a\nunified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from\nincorporating both event types.

With the\nnatural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which\ncalls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several\nearly efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they\nadopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without\nleveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,\nlacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict\nevaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require\nreasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the\nfirst benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source\nCTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,\nstructured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that\ncapture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate\nten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show\nnoticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our\ndesigned retrieval-augmented techniques.

Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored\ninstance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from\n(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about\none more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or\nperhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data\ncollection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to\nuncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data\ncollection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself.

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability.

The discrete code space\naffords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under\nboth greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports\ntrade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and\ncontrollable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive\nexperiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art\nzero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style\nconsistency, while maintaining rich output diversity.

We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in\ncontent such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the\nsolution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the\nsuccess of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable\nmodels to internalize these reasoning patterns.

However, it remains unclear\nhow algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic\nunderstanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge\nassignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.\nSpecifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation\nChallenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \\$500,000\nto student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where\nhigh-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a\nfull week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during\ndeployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level\nmatching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,\nunderscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human\ndecision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings."}

However, the conventional process for creating and\nanimating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,\nrequiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from\nprofessional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation\nmodels, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars\nfrom a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While\nthese techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer\ncompelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or\nan explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when\nrendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,\nwe build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital\nhumans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,\nMVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and\ngenerates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to\n360 degrees around a target subject.

This is\naccentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the\nstrong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address\nthis problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that\naccomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the\nfirst phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize\ncatching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated\nsmoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a\nreal-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the\nend-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the\nobject to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the\nrobot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on\nhuman demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with\nunknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used\nto enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a\nstack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a\nsecondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one\ndimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics\nproposed.

Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index.

However, current approaches to gene\nanomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible\ngraphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable\nframework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines\nclassical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a\nunified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of\nanomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating\nalgorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders\n(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a\nhigh predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the\nutility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,\nwhere it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers\ninsights into disease mechanisms."}

Evidence from multiple domains highlights the\ncritical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream\napplications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA\nmodel post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's\nability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the\nprocess of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews\npost-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor\nlearning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A\nstructured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)\nenhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)\ndeepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key\nchallenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing\na conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a\ncomprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human\nmotor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.\n(Project website: https://github.com/AoqunJin/Awesome-VLA-Post-Training)"}

In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines."}

In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models.

Our approach has both reproducible results, because it\nemploys open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5\ndifferent LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and\nprompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the\ngeneration successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a\nteacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter\nissues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding\nevaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome\nthese issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs\ndirectly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop\npersonalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method\nis adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in\nreal-world educational settings."}

However, inherent photometric distortions\nin the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without\naccounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently\nincorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the\nquality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D\nscene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By\nintroducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full\nphotometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on\nsimultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the\nproposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D\nscene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric\nparameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene\nrepresentation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the\ncamera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a\ncomplete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera\nphotometric model.

To enable this, we propose a\ntraining-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age\naccuracy, and condition control.

However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift.

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining."}

To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an\nend-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods.

FlickCD introduces an Enhanced\nDifference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between\ntemporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and\nweather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change\ndecoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion\nBlocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global\nSelf-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple\nscales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments\non four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and\nstorage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\\% F1)\naccuracy trade-off.

As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch\ncan have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we\nintroduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose\nto use determinantal point processes for this task.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive\nexperiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL\nprotocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in\nage accuracy and identity consistency."}

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench.

To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and\nefficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD.

The proposed model consists of two key modules: a\nlocal-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate\nlocal dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models\ntemporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a\nhybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete\nphase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the\nnetwork. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on\nMICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available\nafter paper acceptance."}

This paper\nintroduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and\neffectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs\nLLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key\nmodules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs\nwith tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and\ndecompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware\nKnowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus\n(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking\nand Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before\na final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a\nchain-of-thought prompt.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

This\nwork proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration\nfor TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for\nevenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly\nweighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones."}

While increasing the\nnumber of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the\nframe rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.\nMoreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when\nacquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot\ndenoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances\ncontrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the\navailable transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form\ncompound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are\nthen used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,\nenabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical\nstructures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while\nthe underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows\nthe network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the\nconsistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no\ndomain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across\nanatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports\nefficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight\narchitecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on\nsimulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement\nand structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based\ndenoising methods."}

We also introduce two knowledge-based\nreport augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up\nto 10\\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our\nresults on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely\nindependent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show\nthat larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT\nwas pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a\nsegmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is\npublicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution"}

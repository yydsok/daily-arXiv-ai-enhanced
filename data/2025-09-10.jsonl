Existing perception-informed local planners\nthat operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical\nrobustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of\ndynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses\ndynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar\nregions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are\nestimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.\nThen, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap\npropagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.\nLastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories\nthat are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,\nobstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps\nexist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners\nare benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in\ndynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other\nbaselines in all environments.

However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as\nContrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and\nresponse quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for\ndecoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a\nguard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially\nunsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe\noutputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;\nand (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model\ngenerates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates\nthese reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The\nframework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model\nfor precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and\nour novel introspection method for effective self-correction.

Each unit transitions between compliant and firm\nstates via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high\nstiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under\nhigh payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into\nreconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We\nvalidate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness\ngripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;\nand (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves\nshape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These\nresults demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for\nprogrammable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable\nmorphology and task-adaptive interaction."}

Key innovations that make our approach\neffective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for\nsimultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a\nsignificant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic\ndifferentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and\nearly-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension\nto universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance\nacross constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per\nquery over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data."}

The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text\nNLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to\nexisting research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations\nof entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the\neffectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar\ndatasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on\nthis dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models\nacross academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing\ndatasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on\ncertain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented\nautomatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.\nOur KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic\ntopological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is\npublicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP."}

The dual approach facilitates the derivation\nof guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of\nPINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material\napproximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural\nnetwork-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs\nmay outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material\ndiscontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs\naccommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful\nselection of test functions to avoid instability.

Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines.

While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings.

To account for roadway heterogeneity, three\nroad classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes\n(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four\nbroader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and\n(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning\nmodels were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based\nfeatures using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:\nXGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models\nincorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on\nstructured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded\nthe most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the\npower of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance\nperson-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable\nframework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity\nmodeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures."}

Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient\nand explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of\nhair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level\nhair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable\nguidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into\nclassifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques."}

In\nActive MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves\ntraining simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a\nsecondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the\ndata used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning\napproach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an\noptimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The\nproposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the\nMINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data.

This\npaper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX\n4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by\nsystem-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To\novercome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive\nInference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no\narchitectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference\nstrategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit\nand resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs\nwithin a unified evaluation framework.

The cooperative behavior\ncan be influenced by the environmental noise in partially observable settings\nand by the decision-making strategies of agents, which may incorporate not only\nreputation but also traits such as generosity and forgiveness. Traditional\nsimulations often assume fully random interactions, where cooperation is tested\nbetween randomly selected agent pairs. In this paper, we investigate\ncooperation dynamics using the concept of Stephen Wolfram's one-dimensional\nbinary cellular automata. This approach allows us to explore how cooperation\nevolves when interactions are limited to neighboring agents. We define binary\ncellular automata rules that conform to the donation game mechanics.\nAdditionally, we introduce models of perceptual and action noise, along with a\nmutation matrix governing the probabilistic evolution of agent strategies. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that cooperation is significantly affected by\nagents' mobility and their spatial locality on the game board. These findings\nhighlight the importance of distinguishing between entirely random multi-agent\nsystems and those in which agents are more likely to interact with their\nnearest neighbors."}

While psychological explanations such as the ideomotor effect\nexist, a computational understanding of how decentralized, implicit linguistic\nknowledge fuses through shared physical interaction remains elusive. We\nintroduce CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework modeling this\nphenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from implicitly fused\nlanguage models. Each participant is represented as an agent associated with an\nenergy landscape derived from an internal language model reflecting linguistic\npriors, and agents exert stochastic forces based on local energy gradients. We\ntheoretically prove that the collective motion of the shared pointer\n(planchette) corresponds to Langevin MCMC sampling from the sum of individual\nenergy landscapes, representing fused collective knowledge.

To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based\nsurrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study\ndeveloped a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U\nNet-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate\npredictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming\ntimesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model\ntemporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample\nmechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'\ncontact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements\nin computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering).

To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior.

While game-theoretic methods\nare widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent\ninteractions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating\nthe intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional\nuncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing\ngame-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor\nscalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive\ntrajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties\nof agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.\nAs the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under\nintentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its\nagent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain\nminor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive\ntrajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium\ncan be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we\npresent a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the\nproblem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant\noutcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nis effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of\nintentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing\ncentralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive\ntrajectory planning in uncertain game settings."}

These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability.

There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness.

IIoT devices acted as multi-agent\ncollaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge\nservers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task\noffloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental\nresults show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an\naverage reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%\nincrease in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model\nnumbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is\nrobust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments."}

In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion).

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The\nfindings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in\nenhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging\nprocess, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption\ncompared with benchmarks."}

We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction.

We show that, as feedback\ngranularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of\nregularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more\nsophisticated than regularized averaging.\n  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this\npattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the\nnumber of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By\ncontrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance\nof regularized averaging with about half as many individuals."}

Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future\nwork includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based\nretrieval. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot"}

It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,\ntime of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in\ngenerating shade images.

To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view.

In this work, we address this\ngap.

As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to\nextrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute\nregime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed\ncompute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level\nof accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin.

In\nthis work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature\nencoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the\ngenerative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual\nfeatures and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled\nand structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models\nare deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo\nneo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the\nground truth to evaluate model predictions.

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset\nconsisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform\nillumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate\nthat our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while\neffectively recovering high-frequency information.

Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic\nsequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for\nunderstanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper\npresents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding\nncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for\nlarge sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs\ntotaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from\napproximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary\nsamples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on\ngenomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence\nas input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do\nnot need transcriptomics data.

To support\ndeletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational\ncomplexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a\ncomputational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.\nWe evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates\n$\\delta\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by\nthe trellis decoder by Tal et al.

In\nPhase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and\nimprove the known {\\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and\napplying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8\nand 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce\ndimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A\nfinal formula using {\\mu}/t, {\\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved\naccuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong\nphysical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic\nregression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful\ndescriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need\nnot sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics."}

While most current research focuses\non the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic\nperformance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically\nneeded to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.\n  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of\ncarefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for\nlong-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs.

This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines.

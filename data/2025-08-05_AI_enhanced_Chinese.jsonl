This\npaper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their\nfault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing\nlayer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables\nscalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises\nunresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,\nand consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new\nframework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a\ncomplementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical\ngaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could\nreshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around\nintent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a\nsilver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,\nreflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u516b\u5366\u534f\u8bae\uff08gossip protocols\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u5982\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u516b\u5366\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u5982\u5bb9\u9519\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u516b\u5366\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u9648\u65e7\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u516b\u5366\u534f\u8bae\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional\nlong-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR\n(LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech,\nwhich has a high degree of contextual relevance.

In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware\nSystem (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this\nlimitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering.

Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using\ndistinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational\noverhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance.

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train\nan outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers\nthat utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,\ninter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents\ncommunicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high\nscalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs\nduring inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,\nwe introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration\nand body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,\nenables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused\nby cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various\nreal-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model\nuncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst\nagents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete\nin-flight loss of one MAV.

In recommender systems, prior work has established that\noptimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the\nobjectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw\ntogether the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity\nmandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit\nhypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within\nthe context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among\nextant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our\nhypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment\nthrough a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with\nsimilar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within\nthe hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity\nbetween items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution,\nthereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities\nwithin the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship\nbetween this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity\nfunction.

The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing\nsingle-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address\ndifferent types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.\nSpecifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG\nmodules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and\ngeneration agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the\nappropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for\neach query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable\ncosts. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement\nlearning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based\npenalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a\nreasonable range.

Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively\nmanufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable\nimprovements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation\nstrategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage\nmask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while\nalso reducing inference time compared to conventional approach.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design.

To address these issues, we propose a\nDecoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF\nconsists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module\nand a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual\ninformation estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to\ndecouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features\nwhile mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight\nself-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality\nand integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused\nrepresentation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality\nselection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion\nDiscrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to\nretain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even\nif the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion\nClassification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging\npreserved inconsistency information.

I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also\nthat these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple\ngains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the\ncontingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my\nfindings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in\nLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u2018\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u5982\u519b\u4e8b\u4e0e\u6c11\u7528\uff09\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u60c5\u5883\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u5982\u519b\u4e8b\u4e0e\u6c11\u7528\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u5982\u519b\u4e8b\u573a\u666f\uff09\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e0e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff1b\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u2018\u6846\u67b6\u2019\uff09\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f97\u5931\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3002"}}

Recent works show that when\ntrained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward\nmodels in these tasks.

Unlike\ntraditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct\ninputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature\nextraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts\nrelevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture\ncomplex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated\nfor both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined\nfault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model, achieving 92.5\\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\\% for\nbearing faults, and 93.1\\% for broken rotor bar detection.

Prior methods retrieve\ndata using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best\ndemonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in\nvisual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a\nsubset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental\ndemonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene\nlayouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We\npresent COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation\nlearning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of\nrelevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.\nCOLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to\nsubsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,\nappearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained\non each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are\nthen used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data\nmore densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general\nand feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by\nany retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest\nbenefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in\nsimulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,\nwhere we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset.

However, enforcing content restrictions remains a\nsignificant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of\ncontent restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via\nmodel alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this\nneed, we propose a new task called \\textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}\n(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model\nfine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for\nspecific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named\n\\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to\nany prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted\nterms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on\nCoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix\nby 15\\%, 17\\%, 10\\%, 9\\%, and 6\\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,\nMistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively.

To further strengthen this alignment, recent\nworks have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple\naudio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby\npromoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness\nin enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a\nnotable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound\nevents-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This\ndeviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining\nobjective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably\nchallenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the\nshared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed\ndifferences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively\nenhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also\nbetter preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related\ndownstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion\nrecognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre\nclassification (MGC), compared to ADC.

In response, we introduce WebDS, the first\nend-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data\nscience tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data\nportals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,\nmulti-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats\nthat better reflect the realities of modern data analytics.

Rather than humans browsing and clicking,\nvision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and\ntransact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?\nWe develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent\nwith a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first\nconduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by\nrandomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and\nplatform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually\nshop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top\nrow, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption\nof a universal \"top\" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward\nendorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally\nhuman-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models.

While hackathons\nhave long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have\ndirectly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a\nhackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of\nTechnology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and\nReliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International\nJoint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked\nparticipants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering\nstudent queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based\nnatural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,\nsolutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or\nhybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed\nvia logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student\nreview to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios.

One of their prominent applications\nin traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky\ndriving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows\nand static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -\nlimiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world\ndriving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised\nrisk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring\ndriver support in intelligent transport systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6eda\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\u98ce\u9669\u9608\u503c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DNN\u5728\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cXGBoost\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u9759\u6001\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u81ea\u7136\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6eda\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\u98ce\u9669\u9608\u503c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cDNN\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "DNN\u5728\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cXGBoost\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u8f66\u8ddd\u6bd4\u6fc0\u70c8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e8b\u4ef6\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u652f\u6301\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling.

However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs\nare the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based\nlanguage models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such\nsimplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction\nobjectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer\nframework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By\ntracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization\nguarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.\nWe prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during\npre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large\nfine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers\ncan achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned\nduring pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating\nsuccessful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,\ntransformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations.

Code:\n  https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT", "summary": "In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient\nexecution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile\nmodels-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical\ntasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and\nmedical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical\nimaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing\nlightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly\npurposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a\nparameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This\ndesign exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being\nlighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we\nintroduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively\nbalances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of\nmedical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer\nbottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with\ndownsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced\ncomputational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering\ndiverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen\ndatasets.

However, existing\nbenchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing\nhigh-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk\nof data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation\nframework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code\ngeneration tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates\nperformance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on\nimportance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted\nAutoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks\nto estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,\nwe introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations\nacross the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that\nsupports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,\noffering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination\nassessment.

However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically\nrelies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain\nin practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and\nperforms poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather\nconditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse\nweather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model\narchitecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is\nachieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of\nclear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.\nSpecifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential\nMechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to\nachieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind\narbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed\nto shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence\nto prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded\nRegularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed\nregularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather\ngeneralization.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes.

Beyond that, the more important\nquestion of how to move forward remains as poignant as ever. SER is far from a\nsolved problem; therefore, identifying the most prominent avenues of future\nresearch is of paramount importance. In the present contribution, we attempt a\nquantification of progress in the 15 years of research beginning with the\nintroduction of the landmark 2009 INTERSPEECH Emotion Challenge. We conduct a\nlarge scale investigation of model architectures, spanning both audio-based\nmodels that rely on speech inputs and text-baed models that rely solely on\ntranscriptions. Our results point towards diminishing returns and a plateau\nafter the recent introduction of transformer architectures. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate how perceptions of progress are conditioned on the particular\nselection of models that are compared.

We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five\nexisting MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k\noutperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR\nmetrics, especially on smaller models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIAs\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3awin-k\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8emin-k\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5win-k\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516b\u4e2aSLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "win-k\u5728AUROC\u3001TPR @ 1% FPR\u548cFPR @ 99% TPR\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "win-k\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this\nproblem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and\nreasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility\nreflected in its gradient.

Based on this\nobservation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence\nQuadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence\nquadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient\ninfluence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.\nFurthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected\nsubsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is\nmore aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and\nevidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning\npatterns.

The recent emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for\ndownstream tasks.

Existing methods struggle\nwith two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset\nQuantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level\noptimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to\nover-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical\nproblem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an\ninformation carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that\nimproving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation\nlearning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework\nwith Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes\nthe latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather\nthan creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior\nperformance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across\nmultiple benchmarks.

The\ndominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical\ninefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to\nleverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To\novercome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal\nmultimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic\ncomponents. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a\ntwo-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce\ndiscriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second\ncomponent, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process\nby leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging\nnegatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives.

We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans.

We scraped Telugu texts\ncovering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites\nand web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a\ncustom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol\nfor collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated\nrationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:\nwith rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed\nplausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,\nfor six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,\nwe curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate\nfairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a\nfairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models.

In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV\nframework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order\nmodeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original\ndecoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained\nautoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs\nbetween computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and\ngeneralization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we\nintegrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to\nexploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel\nmaterials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while\nmaintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various\ntechniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion\nequation, using only observable data.

This inward focus results, in part, from the\ncomplexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile\nlaboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the\nVariable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and\nreveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In\nthis work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better\nrobot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular\nrobots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,\nadaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from\nsimple two-dimensional robot assemblies.

Remarkably, despite the absence of pose\nsupervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view\nsynthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.\nIt also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose\nestimation.

While fusing multiple domains often\npresumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can\nyield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis.

Our results reveal that while certain\nmonolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant\nlimitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse\nlanguage families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need\nfor more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff08MGT\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u8005\u5f52\u5c5e\uff08AA\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5355\u8bed\u8a00AA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u5f52\u5c5e\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3LLMs\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8986\u76d618\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c8\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff087\u79cdLLMs\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f5c\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u8bed\u8a00AA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5bf9\u5f52\u5c5e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u5355\u8bed\u8a00AA\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00AA\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00AA\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In\neach interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and\nexpresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user\nrequest and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can\ninfer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that\nsatisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary\nLLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from\nmulti-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant\nto a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall.

However,\nexisting PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)\nevaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,\nmaking it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later\nones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation\nparadigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly\nincorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the\nconventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier\nones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely\nthrough prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,\nwithout any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures\nBiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using\nsamples generated by three different policy models.

Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training\nstrategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from\nCoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM.

One key challenge\nhere is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not\nexplicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,\na neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects\nfrom a few training examples and a structured natural-language task\nspecification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract\nspatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate\nrepresentation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)\npredicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the\ngrounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ninduce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.\nThis program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.\nFor (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture\nprimitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object\nposes based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning\nthree distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing\nitems on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show\nthat SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically\nfeasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements.

However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u7ee7\u627f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6216\u538b\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u504f\u89c1\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6295\u8d44\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u56db\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u987e\u95ee\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u5546\u3001\u590d\u5408\u538b\u529b\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u51716500\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u5546\u548c\u538b\u529b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u5347\u7ea7\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

However, its clinical deployment is\nhindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,\ncaused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.\nSecond, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease\nprevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.\nThird, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,\noften leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the\nreliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these\nissues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces\nuncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and\ncontextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair\nResampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects\ninformative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution\nuncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances\nthe modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting\nunderrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent\nconditions.

In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire\nsufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,\nwe decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge\ncontent learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we\nconstruct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world\nwebsites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web\nagent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the \"nouns\" upon\nwhich comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason\nand act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through\na novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing\nand training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner.

To address this, we propose\nReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by\nequipping it with a strategic analysis capability.

The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also\nequipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal\nestimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall\nmotion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the\nsize of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive\nlearning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well\nas in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter\nand the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of\nthe implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go\narbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with\nthe true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion\nplanning performance over time.

Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that\nT2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT\nof 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling\nwith minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable\ntokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge\ntransfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three\nLIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation\nlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTokenized Skill Scaling (T2S)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec8\u8eab\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec8\u8eab\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "T2S\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5c06\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cT2S\u5728\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u5e73\u5747NBT\u4e3a1.0%\uff09\u3001\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u4ec5\u97008.0%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08\u5e73\u5747FWT\u4e3a77.7%\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "T2S\u4e3a\u7ec8\u8eab\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9632\u6b62\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing methods based on large language\nmodels fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate\nthe closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes\na multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first\ntime integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search\nmechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and\nhypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating\nscientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an\ninitial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior\nbeliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It\nthen employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature\nevidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'\ntheorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information\nentropy $H = - \\sum {{p_i}\\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the\niterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and\nconfidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world\nresearch question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12\noptimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves\nby 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the\nframework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases\nsignificantly by 0.92.

To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking\nPolicy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and\nMax@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the\n\"hitchhiking\" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if\nthey co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,\nresulting in inefficient optimization.

To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the\ncomplexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware\ncoordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot\ntarget tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions.

To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned\ninto subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots\nexperiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate\nindependently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them\nto contribute to the task within their local context.

In recent\nyears, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key\ntasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data\nprocessing and data representation capabilities.

However, directly extending them to the video\ndomain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects\ntemporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group\nCaptioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning.

Our solution to this problem explores large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a\nsimple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our\nfinal system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the\ntest set.

Despite\nthe emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing\nsituation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse\nthan traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation\n(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a\npartial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach\nto obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation\nbranch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label\nPropagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP\nbranch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and\nfeature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.\nFollowed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the\ncontribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP\nbranch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few\nfeatures are available but also in abundantly available situations.

In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained\nsolely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless\nexhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)\nRecurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable\nregularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent\nMemory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;\nand (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over\na time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform\ncurrent decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and\ntemporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory\nare present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits\ninformation-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through\ncontrolled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either\nenvironmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).\nSurprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not\nalways prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the\npseudo-Thompson Sampling effect.

We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk.

This influx of data presents opportunities\nfor cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts\nwhile also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope\nwith this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by\njointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their\noriginal data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability\ndifferences and educational context differences between different\ngroups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of\nmodels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware\nfederated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models\nbuilt upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,\npreserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students\non each client.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues.

We find that\nsimple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise\nframing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal\nactivation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a\nlate-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.\nWe also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models\ndo not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical\nperspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts\n(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than\nthird-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger\nrepresentational perturbations in deeper layers.

However,\nthis tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack\nsurface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,\ndescriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify\nthis as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be\npreferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or\naccess to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we\npropose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning\nframework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically\nvalid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates\nseamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the\nagent's execution framework.

Among\nthem, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional\nperformance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of\nR1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models\nenhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by\nincorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection\nthrough reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of\nthese models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,\nwhen generating answers, these models often construct excessively long\nreasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced\nreasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this\nend, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce\nthe length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and\nreasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the\nfield of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing\nworks into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization\nversus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which\nfocuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)\nEfficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing\nreasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models.

However, segmentation models trained on\nstatic datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and\nevolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)\nallows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,\nwe build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\\'e-regularized\nIncremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced\nvariant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of\nsurgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical\nloss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical\npseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery\nenvironments.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination.

Applying these\nmethods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static\nvehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed\ninstallations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,\nocclusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on\nspecialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these\nconditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable\ndirect recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.\nThis study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models\nrecognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and\nnon-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline\nfilters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several\nprompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a\nrevised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection\nmodule, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class\ndataset, correcting mismatches.

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation\nmodel with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through\nself-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with\nexpert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers\nthree significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot\ngeneralisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and\nout-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control\npolicies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is\nlightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling\nlarge-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC\nprocess and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its\nself-iteration and a new synchronous communication network.

Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can\neffectively generate requirement-violating scenarios.

Different from the\nexisting CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update\nof the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution\nof the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of\nearly snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,\nwe propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly\ncombats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or\nchange amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots.

Finally, we rigorously prove that the\nslowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is\n$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping\nmethods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a\nsignificant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural\nODEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u521a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u6709A\u7a33\u5b9a\u548cL\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u90fd\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u521a\u6027\u795e\u7ecfODE\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u521a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u521a\u6027\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u6700\u6162\u4e3a$O(|z|^{-1})$\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u6709A\u7a33\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u521a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u90fd\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521a\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u662f\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u6784\u6210\u663e\u8457\u969c\u788d\u3002"}}

Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic\nadaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven\nfeature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)\nVFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone\ntask-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.\nBuilding on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines\na Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate\nVFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority\nover state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u96c6\u5408\u67a2\u8f74\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SPL\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548cVFM\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff08DG\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u65f6\u3002SPL\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "SPL\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548cVFM\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8c03\u4f18\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7126\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "SPL\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548cVFM\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,\nexisting methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics\nand predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the\nflexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.\nTo alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for\nstochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two\nstages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal\ncontinuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,\nthe anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to\nprevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns.

Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain.

However, in real clinical scenarios,\ndue to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face\nthe issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the\nfeatures of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with\nresampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or\nunderfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we\npropose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis\n(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that\ncombines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal\ncomplementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually\nadapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class\ndistribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model\nto progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.\nExtensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various\nmetrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,\nas a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other\nmodels, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis\naccuracy.

Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry,\neconomics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational\nneurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic,\nmulti-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior\nacross cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior\nand probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional\ntasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across\nperceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as\na flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes,\nlearning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts\nand over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a\nphenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for\nplayers aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress\nresilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers\neffects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity),\nuncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how\nclinical features map onto distinct adaptations.

Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level\nprediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while\noverlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction\nstage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap\nand suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown\npromise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds\nupon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.\nThis inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and\ninterdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and\ndrastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a\nCascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an\naverage of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust\nslide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling\nstrategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both\nmodel-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a\nLocal-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution\nWSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global\ncontextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR\nis optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity.

Our best model,\nCyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight\nmodels, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and\ndemonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively\ndemocratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cyber-Zero\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168LLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00CTF\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u9a71\u52a8LLM\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aCTF\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCyber-Zero\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534713.1%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f73\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Cyber-Zero\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

However, their application to semantic segmentation is\nhindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as\nsegmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM\npre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation\nscenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the\nRein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and\nlogit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic\ntransfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment\nanything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with\nefficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and\nadaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of\nparameters.

The latter, also known as region-based\ncorrespondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to\nenable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at\npixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two\nsteps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.\nIn this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly \"searching for\ncorresponding prompts\", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models\n(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we\nintroduce the \"corresponding prompt problem\", which aims to identify a\ncorresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,\nsuch that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of\ncorresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an \"inverse\nprompt\" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,\ninverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y.

Recent advances move beyond\ndiscrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward\ncontinuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential\nEquations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the\nunderlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,\nextrapolation, and classification.

To\nachieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and\n(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms.

This paper, developed for the\nMSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of\nsigner-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of\nCSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,\ncentered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,\nand an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled\nfeature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate\ncommunicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating\nDBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel\nCSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer\ndesign of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal\ndependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology\nachieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on\nthe development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd\nplace ranking on the official competition platform.

A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual\npre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining\nfrom scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This\nconclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and\ndiversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose\nan efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues\nexperience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible\ncompute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay\nrates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a\nmore valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more\ncompute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of\nreplaying old examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Llama\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e861000\u4ebf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u9996\u6b21\u5728LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MER\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6bd4\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u56de\u653e\u66f4\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Benchmark release at\n  https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm", "summary": "Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform\nmulti-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing\nbenchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or\nsimple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better\nevaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm\nconsists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling\nfirewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service\nattacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and\nrule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these\ntasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We\nevaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude\nSonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.\nSurprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these\nfrontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate\n(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these\nmodels are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in\nchatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading\nagentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it\nalso amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from\nalignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to\nmonitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is\nsignificantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,\nwith average detection accuracy at only 72%.

However, they cannot yet do so reliably:\nthey bypass the monitor 16-36\\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on\nsandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to\nunderstand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT\nmonitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.\nThese results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help\nbuild more diverse sandbagging model organisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5371\u9669\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u201csandbagging\u201d\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u6545\u610f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0b\u9690\u853d\u5730sandbag\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0816-36%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5371\u9669\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0csandbagging\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u5a01\u80c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u9632\u5fa1\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0b\u6545\u610fsandbag\uff08\u5206\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7\u65e0\u77e5\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u611f\u77e5\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u9690\u853dsandbag\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u80fd\u57280-shot\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9690\u853dsandbag\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0816-36%\uff09\u3002\u672a\u6355\u83b7\u7684CoT\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u9690\u853dsandbag\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

By systematically varying concept dimensionality\n(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we\nidentify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept\nlearning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and\ncompositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much\nbetter able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and\nestablish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes\n'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization\nto be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly\nincrease generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of\nadaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.\nOverall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus\nfeatural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to\nunderstanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in\nfew-shot concept learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u5feb\u901f\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u6cd5\uff08PCFG\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5e03\u5c14\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5143-SGD\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e8c\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u68af\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS\noptimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves\nas the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of\nprogressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy\nconstraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness\nacross six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against\nstate-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance\non three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and\nGloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean\nand GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond\nANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning\ncan function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic\noptimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual\nrefinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN", "AI": {"tldr": "CRINN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff08ANNS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff08ANNS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0cCRINN\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "CRINN\u5c06ANNS\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684ANNS\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684NNS\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCRINN\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08GIST-960-Euclidean\u3001MNIST-784-Euclidean\u548cGloVe-25-angular\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5217\u7b2c\u4e00\uff08SIFT-128-Euclidean\u548cGloVe-25-angular\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "CRINN\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728ANNS\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Experimental results show that our framework\nachieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,\nrespectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with\npositive rates ranging from approximately $4\\%$ to $13\\%$. Moreover, it\noutperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including\nestablished risk scoring systems.

More specifically, given\nonly raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge\noutputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training\nvirtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:\nTask Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature\nretrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop\noptimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated\ngeneration of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts\nwith differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to\ncollaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.\nWe demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,\nusing six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and\ncytokine stimulations across multiple modalities.

However, current RLVR methods\ntypically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response\nrollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,\ngeneral-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to\ngenerate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable\ntoken-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned\nidentical rule-based rewards.

Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing\nscenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery\nplatforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and\n10.68% increase in ROI.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRAD\uff08Generative Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u5165\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Transformer\u548cDiffuser\uff09\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "GRAD\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ade\u4ef7\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRAD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7f8e\u56e2\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86GMV\u589e\u957f2.18%\u548cROI\u589e\u957f10.68%\u3002", "conclusion": "GRAD\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Users should only rely on a\nsystem recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is\nfactually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate\ntrustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's\ntrustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make\ninformed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system\n(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers\noptimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and\nresponsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived\nfrom existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,\ncognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.\nWe are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically\nthe cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication\nmaxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated\nsystems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped\nby both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal\nnorms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or\nscenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed\nguidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated\nsystems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available.

Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions.

To overcome these obstacles, we introduce\nEpi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired\nNeural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic\ntransmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept\nof neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep\nlearning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to\nmodel spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world\ndatasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future\nepidemic containment.

When approaching a work zone, large\ntrucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures\ncaused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of\nlarge truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated\nwith merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging\nbased on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into\na mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is\ncritical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a\nminimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free\nmerging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in\nresponse to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is\ncompared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based\nmerging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based\nmerging strategies.

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features.

To overcome this, we propose an implicit\nprogram-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across\nmultiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing\nimplicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question\nwords, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring\na more precise execution of reasoning steps.

We present a novel defence method against\ntargeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called\nLinear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as\nclustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious\nnodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a\nlinear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.\nThis method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear\ncombinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out\nredundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established\ndefence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks\nfrom both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments\nconfirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application\nsettings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated\nlearning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to\nbaseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for\nmalicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it\npreserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and\n0.5.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

Services like\nClearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a\nlarge amount of online content associated with that person. This not only\nenables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as\nsocial media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their\nconsent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a\nuser-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such\nretrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial\nsignatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically\ndeformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of\nany facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing.

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method\nto improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.\nCode is available at https://github.com/BNU-ERC-ITEA/DeflareMamba.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeflareMamba\u5229\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u955c\u5934\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u955c\u5934\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u56e0\u5149\u4e0e\u955c\u5934\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u6b65\u957f\u91c7\u6837\u5efa\u7acb\u957f\u7a0b\u50cf\u7d20\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u5f3a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u591a\u79cd\u5149\u6655\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u5149\u6655\u533a\u57df\u81ea\u7136\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, neither RGB nor event\ndata alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these\nissues without additional sensors remains underexplored.

However, DNNs typically rely on large\ndatasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making\nthe training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have\nbeen proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and\ndataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating\nrepresentative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two\nsignificant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate\nthe quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive\nbias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training\nimages require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,\nleading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by\nthe nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a\nDNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the\ngeneralization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory\ncomputing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images\nneed to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR\nenergy consumption.

In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric\ncondition, namely $\\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the\nsoftmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error\n$\\epsilon$.

In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of\nthese emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies\ncannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the\nfirst unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable\nand agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts\ndecentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent\nauthentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,\nand smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control\npolicies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message\nauthenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across\nagent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine\n(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including\nByzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission\nrevocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in\nneutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS\nattacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a\npractical implementation for Google's A2A protocol.

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to\nimprove their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a\ncontinual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model\nadaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden\nof existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme\nto store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory\nconsumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and\nfostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor\nprediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,\nthereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism.

Existing\nRAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,\nlimiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues.

First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective\nuse of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording\nsupport, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human\nones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies\nwith little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of\nhuman-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover\nsignifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to\nanticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While\nPartial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing\nautomation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects.

Furthermore, we\nintroduced TransRA (TransR\\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads\nranking models.

To address this challenge, we employed the\nLarge ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE\nfinetuning approach within the Ads ranking models.

Despite compositional learning's\nprogress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional\nstructure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)\nNeglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and\nimpairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like\nsymbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by\nexplicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To\nthis end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates\ndual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical\nPrimitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the\ncompositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The\nlatter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,\nempowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing\nthese constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network\narchitectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic\nabstraction and existing models.

While\nFederated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving\napproach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to\nheterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily\naddresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first\nexperimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six\nrepresentative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging\nmodalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically\ndesigned to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:\nFairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six\ndemographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real\ncross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR.

This approach, which operates without dependency on\nlanguage models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse\nprompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.\nValidated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned\nwith only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing\nmethods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9\npercentage points compared to the best baseline.

Multi-shot reconstruction faces\nfundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal\nresolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and\nthe lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI\nvideo reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor\nmodule explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.\n(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual\ndescriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging\nhigh-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from\nexisting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation\nstudies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic\ncaptioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP\nsimilarity by 71.8%.

In this paper, we show that under\nstandard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in\ntreatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the\ntreatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed\ndata. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We\nimplement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the\nlikelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the\nunderlying outcome function.

To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified\n3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.\nThus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate\nsystem defined by the canonical body pose.

However, for modern applications, e.g.,\nthe optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require\nhundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over\na high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs\n$\\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated\ninputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.\nExisting black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''\n(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address\nthis, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)\napproach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\\mathbf{x}^*$\nthat leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently\ninferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can\nselect solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.\nAssuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with\nunknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM\nestimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization\nrate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,\nthus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a\npractical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive\nGaussian process surrogate model.

In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear\ncomplexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers\nin encrypted traffic classification with pre-training.

To aggregate these uncertainty\nfeature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout\ndata. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,\ninvestigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression\nmodels.

However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods\nface several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities\nhinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack\nadaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are\ndecoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature\nalignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal\n3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network\nto process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign\nmodule between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention\nmechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a\nreinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that\nconsistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features.

Existing approaches are often\nconstrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern\ndeep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that\naffect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through\ndiscretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,\na novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB\nevents. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte\nprediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed\nbinary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core\nnovelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and\ntokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most\nfundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,\na hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to\ndiscover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.\nOur primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework\nfor LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a\ncomprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million\nevents from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized\nfacts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,\nheavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing.

We\nintroduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum\nSemi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum\nSemi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation\nstrategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR\ndecomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby\nenabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods\nacross four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German\nCredit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform\nleading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under\nlimited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect\nof circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement\nentropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB).

However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones.

As a parametric policy in\nreinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data\nrequirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most\nRL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter\nspaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy\nupdate requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC.\nWhile MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to\nsecond-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order\npolicy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.\n  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy\nHessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling\nsuperlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve\nrobustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable\ntraining under noisy estimates.

However, existing methods\nstill face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling\nannotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nbidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical\nqueries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional\nrelevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces\ntwo query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from\nmulti-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate\nstructured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from\nintra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial\nelements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and\nprompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster.

By exploring this, this paper introduces the\nforgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)\nwith long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates\nthree key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,\nwhich is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic\nspatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that\ncan adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling\nthe collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical\nmulti-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by\nmodeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics\nof users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online\nA/B tests and achieved a 1.54\\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).\nIn addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements.

Despite recent advances in\napplying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms\npresent unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback\nin RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and\nunstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced\nReasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed\nreasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A\nfirst leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer\nlatent query intent.

Meta-RAG scores\n84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization\nrates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMeta-RAG\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548cLLM\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u538b\u7f29\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u4ee3\u7801\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMeta-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u786e\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-bench Lite\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMeta-RAG\u5728\u6587\u4ef6\u7ea7\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523084.67%\u548c53.0%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u548cLLM\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

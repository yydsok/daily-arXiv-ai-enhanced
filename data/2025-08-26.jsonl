In this work, we\nintroduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a\nnovel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs\nend-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion\nautoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to\nenhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec\nachieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of\n0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining\nsuperior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as\nWord Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS).\nNotably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and\nobviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the\ncompatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech\nwith both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating\nits effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a\nsignificantly small reconstruction-generation gap.

We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that\nanalyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength\nbetween given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,\nstakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments\non diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior\nperformance while reducing computational costs by 34\\% compared to uniform deep\nreasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional\njudgment tasks, achieving 23\\% improvement in consistency and 18\\% better\naccuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science\nprinciples with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to\nadaptive reasoning in LLMs."}

In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that\nuses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First\n(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an\nincoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow\n(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id).

In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy.

The\ngeomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),\nsurrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.\nThe faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The\nheterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by\nhierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,\nmean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell\nproperties of each realization, are uncertain.

Based on the objective metric, we further design a\nreward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve\na mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain.

Hence, they are not able to represent\nsynchronization, i.e. executing objects only according to their intended\nrelationships, and fail to identify violating executions. Existing formal\nmodeling approaches, such as object-centric Petri nets with identifiers (OPID),\nrepresent object identities and relationships to synchronize them correctly.\nHowever, OPID discovery has not yet been studied.

However, many\ncritical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In\nparticular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,\nhow humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the\nrisks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need\nto rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should\nmove beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems\nshould implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.\nFurthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full\nspectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,\nmulti-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,\nconflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges\nassociated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value\nalignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of\nvalue alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications."}

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the\nedge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and\nentropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and\ntime-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area."}

While existing methods\nsupport direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to\nedit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography\nscenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating\niterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,\nwe first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset\ncomprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In\naddition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance\ngeneration coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.\nConsidering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable\niterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a\nprediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the\ninitial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated\nresults by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.\nMoreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text\ndescriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a\nspecifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM\nadaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as\ntemporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results\ndisplay music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with\ntext descriptions.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach.

Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task.

However, existing CapsNet and\nvariants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich\ncomplementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional\nfeature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to\nreconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal\nclassification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the\nMulti-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that\nintegrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.\nSpecifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet\nBackbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement\nRouting (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature\nrepresentations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and\nglobal contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these\nmulti-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,\nequipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.\nFinally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by\nidentifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the\nsimple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the\nmost coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps\nachieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently\nsurpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with\nconfigurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)\nto a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in\nadvancing feature representation learning."}

Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the\ninformation specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To\ndelve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution\nand formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for\nattribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also\nintroduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and\ncomplements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs.

To address the notable challenge of data\nacquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process\nmixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution\ninformation by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By\nleveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a\ndata-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then\nintroduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits\nthe derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire\nprediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity\nset for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its\nsafety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the\nambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure\nspace, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and\ncomputation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are\ngenerated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The\ndistributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed\nambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes\nthrough tractable semi-definite programming.

Existing approaches based\non reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to\nextract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization\nacross object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains\n(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep\nCNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic\nfeature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,\nespecially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)\ncompresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding\ndiscriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends\nto discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM\nintegrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)\nmodule to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential\noverfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization\ntechniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which\nenhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and\na 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel\nRelationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789\nFPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU.

We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales.

The\nproposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues\nthrough four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based\nCNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning\nCNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial\nattention mechanism.

In this work, we propose an\nAdversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise\nproblem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each\ntraining iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using\nincorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.\nThis process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,\nnamely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as\nobject changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these\nadversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an\nonline global prototype.

Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have\ndemonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.\nNevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory\ncontours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human\nperception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep\nnetwork called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the\ncircuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection\n(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the\ninteraction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction\nattention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the\nshape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via\nthe edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network\nto concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST\ntest set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.\nComprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more\nsensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,\nwith notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets.

Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning\nthe node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in\nanalyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the\nmajority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised\nresult quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and\nattributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and\nbillions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to\naddress the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel\ntwo-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive\nhigh-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet\nenergy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of\nclustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves\nsignificantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM\nthrough a suite of well-thought-out optimizations.

Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions\nin batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically\ncompressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource\ncompetition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation\n(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from\nbatch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages\nbatch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model\nto allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to\ninternalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA\nenables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining\nsufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones.

We develop a statistical test\nsequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and\npropose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically\ngoverns system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.\nEmpirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map\nestimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform\nclassical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and\npredictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS\noffers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems."}

Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows\nthat treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly\neffective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of\nsignificantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and\npractical deployment in real-world applications."}

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to\ndifferentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a\ndecision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results\nshow that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness\nand accuracy in the presence of biased data.

However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts\nand noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt\nenhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing\ncomprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic\nperspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:\nTopology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic\nDiscriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of\nincomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates\nsynonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and\nconstructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy\nand persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual\nnoise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative\nregions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,\neffectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.\nGiven the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual\nprompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time\nadaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual\nalignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs."}

However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones.

In response, we\nintroduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently\nupdates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with\nonly a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose\nestimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change\ndetection to pinpoint modifications in the scene.

In this paper, we propose\nJCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free\nVirtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by\nintegrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional\nfusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our\napproach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference\nperson image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through\ndedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention\nlayers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and\nattention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person\nintegration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional\ngeneration strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based\nmodel to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''\nmodel, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment\nimages.

This disparity is not\nwithout consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological\ncharacteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the\nmost advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the\nchoice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for\nfine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of\naccurate classification and robust segmentation.\n  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed\nto enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of\nregions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both\nlong-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art\nmodels that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design\nthat reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions\nencountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that\nintermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and\nefficiency.

We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine\nwhether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or\nsynthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of\ntransport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to\nestimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear\ntransport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport\nefficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear\ntransport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers\npractical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where\ncomputation in LLMs behaves linearly."}

Usually, approaches to\nuncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights\ncannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large\nlanguage models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we\ngeneralize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which\nmotivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a\nnovel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel\nrisk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration\nerrors.

The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through\npretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation\ncapabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive\nevaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,\nachieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean\nconditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and\n92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight\nRAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to\ndetect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a\npractical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect\ndata curation is challenging."}

However, GNSS are highly vulnerable\nto spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead\nreceivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected\nnavigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most\nexisting spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques\nand struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this\nlimitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid\nQuantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS\nsignals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted\nduring the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT\nsolutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS\nreceivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,\nwhere attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time\ncomputations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen\ntime-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and\nsophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently\noutperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based\nmodels, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,\nunseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy\nof 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs\nbut is not detected).

Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the\ncomputational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The\ntext-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token\npruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.\nHowever, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing\nlater in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's\noutput. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens\ncorresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning\nthat disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom.

The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that\nwhile LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in\nspecific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose\nemergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected\ncognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical\nresults highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill\nacquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions\nand neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine\nlearning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and\nsuggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed\nlearning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions."}

Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection\nstrategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by\ntext tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively\naggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual\ninformation extraction process.

To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an\nagentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate\nexploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of\nagents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An\nanalyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current\nprompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to\ndirectly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a\ngenetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving\ncandidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to\nprogressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments\nconducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of\nGreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for\nautomatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,\ncommonsense, and ethical decision-making."}

Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning\nstage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing\nincreased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating\noverthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,\ndefined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP).

Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted\nAggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into\nthe aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model\nwhile significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse\nActivation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during\nthe aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from\nthe update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic\npruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper\ncompression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication\nreduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\\%-38\\%\ncommunication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\\%-40\\% communication cost on ResNet-34,\nwhile maintaining model accuracy within 1\\% degradation."}

Then, leveraging\nthese labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different\nmodalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse\ntraversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based\nsupervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,\nextensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling\nmethod consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared\nto existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal\ntraversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by\n1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets."}

Accepted at EDTconf 2025", "summary": "Digital twins (DTs) are increasingly utilized to monitor, manage, and\noptimize complex systems across various domains, including civil engineering. A\ncore requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and\nmaintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To\nthis end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct\nreal-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived\nfrom high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)\nspecialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor\ndata from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT\nengineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines\noften train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,\ntask- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required\nto design DTs.\n  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable\nthe systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes\nand DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow\nparadigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models.\nIt also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML\nalgorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nusability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving\nthe design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a\nstructure."}

To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse\nmatrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We\nthen solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location\ninformation of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers."}

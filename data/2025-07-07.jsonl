While AI agents\noffer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,\nlimiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a\nself-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA\nrepresents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and\ngrow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical\ndiscovery."}

Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real\nor synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly\nunderwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune\nDepth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater\nvariant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based\nunderwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model\nconsistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms\nbaselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides\na detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation\nin underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and\nscale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth\npredictions in challenging underwater environments for future research."}

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings."}

However, for some applications, a\nmore suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and\npath length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based\nschemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration\nspace. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being\nprimarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient\npath-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing\ntime. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on\nU-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,\nwhich we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of\nthe entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the\niterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling\nprocess. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500\nbi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a\nsimulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250\npreviously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to\nquantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that\nusing SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as\nconnecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing\nprocessing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable\nfor mobile service robots in structured environments."}

However, existing studies in this area remain\nscarce.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based\nsubsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing\nadjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition\nAdaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and\nReinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget\nconstraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.\nFurthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment\ntailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation\nand benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising\nreal-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse\nmarket conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for\nride-hailing service providers."}

Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations.

On\nthe temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the\nbidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in\ntraffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO\nreinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback\nmechanism.

This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework.

We\nalso compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on\nDMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction\ntasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our\ntransformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to\nDeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the\npotential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in\npredictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and\nexploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction."}

Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the\nMulti-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM\nexplanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect\nfiltering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes\nPipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising\nvisual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference\noptimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nfor AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned\nexplanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference\nstage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model\nperception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further\nenhancing the generalization capabilities.

To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD\ndataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly\ntasks."}

Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates\ncontextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically\ngenerating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric\njailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic\ntoxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt\nthat reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.\nSpecifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success\nRate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming\nthe baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature.

This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several\nrehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,\nmaintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as\na scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary\ncontinual learning environments."}

Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,\neditable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them\nsuitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In\naddition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that\nachieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,\nalong with a robust material painting module capable of transferring\nappearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe\nmisalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nLiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:\nhttps://litereality.github.io; Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecK9m3LXg2c"}

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the\nintegration of large language models (LLM) as annotators.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks."}

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching.

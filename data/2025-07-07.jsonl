While AI agents\noffer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,\nlimiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a\nself-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA\nrepresents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and\ngrow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical\ndiscovery."}

To address this, we fine-tune\nDepth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater\nvariant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based\nunderwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model\nconsistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms\nbaselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

Crucially, we introduce a novel heading\ncorrection mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in\nconjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of\nyaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized\nBlue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic\napproach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free\nlocalization and reliable orientation estimation.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying\nanomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising\nsolution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.\nMoreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and\nsemi-supervised settings."}

However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being\nprimarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient\npath-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing\ntime. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on\nU-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,\nwhich we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of\nthe entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the\niterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling\nprocess. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500\nbi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a\nsimulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250\npreviously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to\nquantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that\nusing SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as\nconnecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing\nprocessing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable\nfor mobile service robots in structured environments."}

In the first stage, a velocity-tracking\npolicy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical\nproprioceptive features.

This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal.

This paper presents an\nagentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI\nagents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage\nin a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately\nperforming end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is\nevaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced\nverification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and\nconfigurability."}

DeepSupp integrates advanced feature\nengineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving\nmarket relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust\nrepresentation learning. The final support levels are extracted through\nunsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price\nthresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that\nDeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy\nand market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market\nconditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a\nscalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach\nhighlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced\nmarket patterns and improve technical trading strategies."}

Furthermore, they\nexhibit distinctive and persistent \"strategic fingerprints\": Google's Gemini\nmodels proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and\nretaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly\ncooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.\nAnthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing\nremarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or\nsuccessfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by\nthe models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and\ntheir opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is\ninstrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with\nmachine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic\ndecision-making under uncertainty."}

This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework.

Although large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization\ntasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically\nLong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and\nDeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent\nabstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive\nand systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning\nLLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented\ndialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary\nlengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and\nadvanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and\nhuman-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,\nour findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently\nimprove dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone\nto verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to\ntheir non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and\ndetailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may\nfail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts.

TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with\nlinear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector\noperations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is\na robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset\nfor broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated\nsystem simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across\nmost evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading\nmodels such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most\ncomprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,\nincluding QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy\nsurface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for\nlarge biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,\nhighly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,\nproviding a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications."}

At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the\nmodel to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure\npreservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful\nstructural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and\na restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual\nquality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both\nstructure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot\nconditioning scenarios."}

Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed\nmanually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective.

Additionally, as\nendothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may\nnot fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed\ntubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture\nand maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity.

Results: Analysis time per image\ndiffered significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker\n(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count\n(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node\ncount (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across\nangiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,\nand circularity (all p<0.0001).

To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nSciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific\npapers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA\nselection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA\ngeneration. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a\nfoundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to\nthe development of AI for Science."}

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to\nstochastically output either a \"poisoned\" or benign response, then upvotes the\npoisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used\nin a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability\nof producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We\nshow that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did\nnot previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that\nintroduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our\nfinding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference\ntuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be\nused to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism\nfor LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data\npoisoning and deployment-time prompt injection)."}

However, LLMs can\ngenerate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the\npreviously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an\nLLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.\nTo think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular\nthinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose\n$\\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL\ntraining method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively\nallowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the\nopen-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient\nfine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our\nexperiments show 3.8\\% and 3.3\\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training\nin the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with\nonly 15\\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF.

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we\ndiscuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer\nmatching."}

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or\nstate-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R."}

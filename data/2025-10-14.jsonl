Our\nsystem uses 360{\\deg} videos recorded along streets and builds a 360RVW through\nfour main operations: video segmentation by intersection detection, video\ncompletion to remove the videographer, semantic segmentation for virtual\ncollision detection with the avatar, and projection onto a distorted sphere\nthat moves along the camera trajectory following the avatar's movements. Our\ninterface allows users to explore large urban environments by changing their\nwalking direction at intersections or choosing a new location by clicking on a\nmap. Even without a 3D model, the users can experience collision with buildings\nusing metadata produced by semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we stream the\n360{\\deg} videos so users can directly access 360RVW via their web browser. We\nfully evaluate our system, including a perceptual experiment comparing our\napproach to previous exploratory interfaces.

Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to\ncapture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations.\nThis decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy,\nenabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the\nsequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters,\nconsisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal\nbit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming\ncanonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating\ntemporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

However, most existing SE methods only handle a\nlimited range of distortions, such as additive noise, reverberation, or band\nlimitation, while the study of SE under multiple simultaneous distortions\nremains limited. This gap affects the generalization and practical usability of\nSE methods in real-world environments.To address this gap, this paper proposes\na novel Universal Discrete-domain SE model called UDSE.Unlike regression-based\nSE models that directly predict clean speech waveform or continuous features,\nUDSE redefines SE as a discrete-domain classification task, instead predicting\nthe clean discrete tokens quantized by the residual vector quantizer (RVQ) of a\npre-trained neural speech codec.Specifically, UDSE first extracts global\nfeatures from the degraded speech. Guided by these global features, the clean\ntoken prediction for each VQ follows the rules of RVQ, where the prediction of\neach VQ relies on the results of the preceding ones. Finally, the predicted\nclean tokens from all VQs are decoded to reconstruct the clean speech waveform.\nDuring training, the UDSE model employs a teacher-forcing strategy, and is\noptimized with cross-entropy loss. Experimental results confirm that the\nproposed UDSE model can effectively enhance speech degraded by various\nconventional and unconventional distortions, e.g., additive noise,\nreverberation, band limitation, clipping, phase distortion, and compression\ndistortion, as well as their combinations.

A novel approach\nthat combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is\nintroduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic\narrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is\nconstructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal\nconfigurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these\nPareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial\nconfigurations, termed \"hot starts\".

This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a\nnovel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse\nscene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.\nThrough extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of\nagent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific\nfailure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings\nhighlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and\ndemonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework\nlays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,\ncontributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases\nand the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous\nvehicles."}

This\nparadigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By\nreducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,\nexisting methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,\nfundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure\ndistribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We\npropose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar\nscore, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the\nintegral of its failure probability density function defined over a\nhigh-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows\nus to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,\ngradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a\nframework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven\nrefinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool\nof counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,\nand applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify\nmechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA\nbenchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower\ncost than strong baselines.

We find that this\nfailure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference\nlearning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,\nwhile neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.\n  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a\nfine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning\npreferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct\nan abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,\nimplementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP.

However,\nthe focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective\nof its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to\naccurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and\norientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods.

Many\nstudies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human\nbrain.

In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a\nPerturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to\nsystematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three\nkey insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting\nthese critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion\nneurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders\nof magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but\ntend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\\_proj\ncomponents; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,\nrather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and\nscales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications\nfor LLM robustness and interpretability.

Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either\non generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face\nsuper-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait\nphotos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general\nmodel processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably\nintroduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to\ndifferent model training recipes, while human perception is particularly\nsensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the\nportrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a\nsingle-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and\nupscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our\nmodel on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision\nmechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then\nintegrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,\nreducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration.

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nand other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of\nchange associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of\nsuch data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different\nspatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across\npopulations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep\nlearning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological\nprocess. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven\nmethod for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling\nsubject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions\nusing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel\nINR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal\ntrajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates\non the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate\nour method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded\ntrajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and\ndementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the\nmore realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves\n81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,\noutperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%)."}

An effective path planning algorithm must manage\nuncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing\ntrack of targets that remain unseen for too long.

Artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these\nlimitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require\nlarge, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently\nstruggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient\nvariability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint\nRetrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided\nimage segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.\nBoth models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage\nretrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the\nretrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual\nsimilarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes\nmeaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the\noverall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple\nsegmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two\nbenchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For\nexample, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice\nscore of 0.8708$\\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of\n1.8130$\\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to\na mean Dice score of 0.9115$\\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\\pm$0.30.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model\ncapabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded\nand projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to\nreconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the\nrouter's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query\nset, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model\nperformance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nrouting performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.\nMoreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without\nretraining the router.

These extensions\nare organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a\nknowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate\nthis process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the\nindependence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's\ncapacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches\nwith new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this\nwork advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs\nin real-world problem-solving."}

Despite early-stage safeguards enabled\nby alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored\nvulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned\npaths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this\nphenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral\ntriggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven\nreasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where\nsurface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain\nescalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe\ncompletions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift\nInduction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,\nand condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,\nwhile their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,\nwe propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution\ncorrection and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues).

Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among\nfirst-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then\ntranslate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the\ncorresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results\non benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms\ntranslating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed\ndataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which\nimproving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the\nfirst-order logic translation."}

To ensure a more natural takeover, a\ndriver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to\nalign with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are\nevaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric.

In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on\nstatic scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color\nvariations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and\ncontrollability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and\nsteerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In\nparticular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key\nview and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to\nnovel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a\nscene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,\nenabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in\nnovel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the\npersonalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all\nother images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a\ndedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed\nframework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable\nsingle image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image\ncolorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability.

We\nanalyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,\nevaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how\nargumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and\nvalue-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for\nexplainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research\ndirections, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial\nsettings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing\nthat computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and\nnormative requirements of transparency in the law domain."}

However, the factors that give rise to\nsuch crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise\nfrom failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object\nentities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we\nassess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,\nand find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all\nstudied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting\nin inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two\neffective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts\nacross languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy\nand consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these\ninterventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual\nspace through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective\nand practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction."}

In this work, based on the pneumatic\nactuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee\nthat is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and\nenable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to\nmodel the human-robot interaction dynamics.

Next, based\non the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to\ncontrol the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in\nreal-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given\nreference signal shown on the screen.

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to\nevaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and\nfundamental machine learning research problems.

However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by\nsymptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance\nof VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches\nleveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there\nremains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for\npredicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing\ntransfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos\nusing the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features\nare then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the\ntemporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over\ntime.

In\nparticular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify\ncritical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of\nperserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the\nrounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across\nmodel layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nQuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible\nperformance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass\nexisting backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings\nhighlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process,\nemphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is\navailable at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA."}

Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF\nmodels has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that\nreliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains\na challenge.

To address these issues, we deeply\nexplore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid\ntagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our\nGapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps\nbetween entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance\ndiscontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an\nadditional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid\ntagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to\ncomprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span\nperspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine\nmechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of\neach span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes\ncriss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At\nthe inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each\nentity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all\nvalid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags.

We then leverage a large-scale\ndataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare\nevaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of\npeople and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative\nqueries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These\nqueries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI\nevaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to\nquantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to\npeople in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.\nHowever, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to\ngame-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens.

Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic\nvarieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,\nlarge language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,\na requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we\naddress these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for\nEuropean Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This\ncollection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing\nresources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and\nscalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it\ninto European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent\nwith Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with\nPortuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we\nestablish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We\nevaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and\nfine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,\nwe perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages.

ECLM\nselectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per\nJoint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background\ntokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the\npotential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based\ndecoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned\nfrom large-scale motion capture datasets.

Secondly, we investigate\nwhether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that\nrequires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate\nfaithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models\ncan handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,\nwe carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for\neach task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while\nmitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive\nablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown\nthat: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual\ntasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and\ngeneration.

While these approaches have shown promise, they often\noperate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene\ncontext, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their\ntemporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make\ninformed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new\nperspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely\nintertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the\nvehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.\nMotivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel\nend-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory\nplanning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,\nthen leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.\nTwo key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects\npredicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene\nmodeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and\ntrajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments\non the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR\nmanifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.\nSpecifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive\nDefinite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann\nmanifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to\nlearn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview\nevidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates\nbelief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep\nfeatures. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines\nevidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,\nand interpretability."}

To address this challenge, we introduce\n\\textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific\nknowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method\naggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into\nan informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM\nto better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We\noptimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored\nreward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline\nexperiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for\nqueries targeting proprietary content.

To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with\nmechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by\ninvestigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs\nand find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's\nassociative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers\neffectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations\ncan be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.\nBuilding on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),\na lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior\nin MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate\nrepresentations to encode associative directions.

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when\ncompared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any\nstrict learning of an image style.

Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels\n(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at\ndifferent distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and\ncauses jarring visual ``popping\" artifacts during transitions, degrading the\nuser experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the\nemerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:\nContinuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality\nscaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems\nof DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a\ncontinuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method\nintroduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian\nprimitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.\nThis allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant\nprimitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one\nmodel. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a\nvirtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy\nwith rendered point count regularization.

(2) We\ngenerate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the\nTriangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further\nupdated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying\nmechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical\nanalysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as\nour baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve\nconsistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks\nwithout any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental\nfeedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement\nability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.\nCode is available at https://github.com/dengyl20/SRF-LLaVA-1.5."}

This paper introduces the Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI),\na novel framework designed to bridge this gap by creating a unified system for\nefficient, hybrid queries on multimodal data. HMGI leverages the native graph\ndatabase architecture and integrated vector search capabilities, exemplified by\nplatforms like Neo4j, to combine Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nwith expressive graph traversal queries. Key innovations of the HMGI framework\ninclude modality-aware partitioning of embeddings to optimize index structure\nand query performance, and a system for adaptive, low-overhead index updates to\nsupport dynamic data ingestion, drawing inspiration from the architectural\nprinciples of systems like TigerVector.

Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show\nthat past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,\naccelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass\n(CoM) shift.

Although backdoor\nattacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on\nuntargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of\ntargeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor\nattacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such\nattacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant\ninference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It\nformulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve\nattack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal\nthat the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors\nsucceed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger\ndesign, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and\ninference triggers.

We\npresent DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables\ngeneralizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single\ndemonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a\nlow-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies\nfor multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands\nto joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.\nThe manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and\nimitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop\nvisual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments\nshow a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy\nperformance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and\nthe data efficiency of our approach.

This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection.

Our approach\napplies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale\nmodel to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer\n(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only\noutperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)\nacross several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale\nteacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled\nmodel exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to\nimage variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest\nthat the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and\nparameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for\ncancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden."}

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when\ncompared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any\nstrict learning of an image style.

In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion\nof LLM-specific utility.

But real life also pushes human intelligence along a\ndifferent frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making\nproblems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice\ngameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem\nsettings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how\nthey play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how\nfun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these\ncapacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive\nGamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)\ngoal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo\ntree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few\nstochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep\nsearch. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000\nparticipants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our\nparticipants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions\nvarying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no\nexperience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect\nexperience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and\ndoes so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level\nmodels. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly\nevaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could\ninform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine\nnot just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at\nall."}

While existing methods\napproximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via\ncustomized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all\nMC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms\nin the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint\nrestricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations\nand ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient\nRL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the\nELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key\nproperties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term\ndepends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation\nacross samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the\nvalue and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based\nobjective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for\nthe original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC\nsample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved\nRL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.\nExperiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for\ndLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks."}

In\nthis paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly\nincentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to\nunderstand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our\nmain finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,\nrepresentation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden\nstates significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for\npost-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For\ninference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves\nefficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and\nreasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%\nimprovement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we\nshow that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves\nreasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL\npost-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained\nQwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,\ndemonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency.
